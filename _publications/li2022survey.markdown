Recently retrieval45;augmented text generation attracted increasing attention of the computational linguistics community. Compared with conventional generation models retrieval45;augmented text generation has remarkable advantages and particularly has achieved state45;of45;the45;art performance in many NLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval45;augmented text generation. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval45;augmented generation and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks including dialogue response generation machine translation and other generation tasks. Finally it points out some important directions on top of recent methods to facilitate future research.

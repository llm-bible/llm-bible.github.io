Recently retrieval-augmented text generation attracted increasing attention of the computational linguistics community. Compared with conventional generation models retrieval-augmented text generation has remarkable advantages and particularly has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many NLP tasks. This paper aims to conduct a survey about retrieval-augmented text generation. It firstly highlights the generic paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation and then it reviews notable approaches according to different tasks including dialogue response generation machine translation and other generation tasks. Finally it points out some important directions on top of recent methods to facilitate future research.

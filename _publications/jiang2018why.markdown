Diversity is a long-studied topic in information retrieval that usually
refers to the requirement that retrieved results should be non-repetitive and
cover different aspects. In a conversational setting, an additional dimension
of diversity matters: an engaging response generation system should be able to
output responses that are diverse and interesting. Sequence-to-sequence
(Seq2Seq) models have been shown to be very effective for response generation.
However, dialogue responses generated by Seq2Seq models tend to have low
diversity. In this paper, we review known sources and existing approaches to
this low-diversity problem. We also identify a source of low diversity that has
been little studied so far, namely model over-confidence. We sketch several
directions for tackling model over-confidence and, hence, the low-diversity
problem, including confidence penalties and label smoothing.

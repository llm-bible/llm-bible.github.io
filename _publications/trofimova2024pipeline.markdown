This paper presents CodeRefine, a novel framework for automatically
transforming research paper methodologies into functional code using Large
Language Models (LLMs). Our multi-step approach first extracts and summarizes
key text chunks from papers, analyzes their code relevance, and creates a
knowledge graph using a predefined ontology. Code is then generated from this
structured representation and enhanced through a proposed retrospective
retrieval-augmented generation approach. CodeRefine addresses the challenge of
bridging theoretical research and practical implementation, offering a more
accurate alternative to LLM zero-shot prompting. Evaluations on diverse
scientific papers demonstrate CodeRefine's ability to improve code
implementation from the paper, potentially accelerating the adoption of
cutting-edge algorithms in real-world applications.

The field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) often focuses on users with a strong technical background making it challenging for non45;experts to understand XAI methods. This paper presents x45;plAIn a new approach to make XAI more accessible to a wider audience through a custom Large Language Model (LLM) developed using ChatGPT Builder. Our goal was to design a model that can generate clear concise summaries of various XAI methods tailored for different audiences including business professionals and academics. The key feature of our model is its ability to adapt explanations to match each audience groups knowledge level and interests. Our approach still offers timely insights facilitating the decision45;making process by the end users. Results from our use45;case studies show that our model is effective in providing easy45;to45;understand audience45;specific explanations regardless of the XAI method used. This adaptability improves the accessibility of XAI bridging the gap between complex AI technologies and their practical applications. Our findings indicate a promising direction for LLMs in making advanced AI concepts more accessible to a diverse range of users.

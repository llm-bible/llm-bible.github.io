Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in recent years achieving remarkable results in question-answering tasks (QA). However they still face two major challenges hallucination and outdated information after the training phase. These challenges take center stage in critical domains like climate change where obtaining accurate and up-to-date information from reliable sources in a limited time is essential and difficult. To overcome these barriers one potential solution is to provide LLMs with access to external scientifically accurate and robust sources (long-term memory) to continuously update their knowledge and prevent the propagation of inaccurate incorrect or outdated information. In this study we enhanced GPT-4 by integrating the information from the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental (IPCC AR6) the most comprehensive up-to-date and reliable source in this domain. We present our conversational AI prototype available at www.chatclimate.ai and demonstrate its ability to answer challenging questions accurately in three different QA scenarios asking from 1) GPT-4 2) chatClimate and 3) hybrid chatClimate. The answers and their sources were evaluated by our team of IPCC authors who used their expert knowledge to score the accuracy of the answers from 1 (very-low) to 5 (very-high). The evaluation showed that the hybrid chatClimate provided more accurate answers highlighting the effectiveness of our solution. This approach can be easily scaled for chatbots in specific domains enabling the delivery of reliable and accurate information.

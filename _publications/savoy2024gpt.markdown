Recently several large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
capability to generate a message in response to a user request. Such scientific
breakthroughs promote new perspectives but also some fears. The main focus of
this study is to analyze the written style of one LLM called ChatGPT 3.5 by
comparing its generated messages with those of the recent US presidents. To
achieve this objective, we compare the State of the Union addresses written by
Reagan to Obama with those automatically produced by ChatGPT. We found that
ChatGPT tends to overuse the lemma "we" as well as nouns and commas. On the
other hand, the generated speeches employ less verbs and include, in mean,
longer sentences. Even when imposing a given style to ChatGPT, the resulting
speech remains distinct from messages written by the target author. Moreover,
ChatGPT opts for a neutral tone with mainly positive emotional expressions and
symbolic terms (e.g., freedom, nation). Finally, we show that the GPT's style
exposes distinct features compared to real presidential addresses.

No previous work has studied the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) an essential and distinct branch of medical knowledge with a rich history. To bridge this gap we present a TCM question dataset named TCM-QA which comprises three question types single choice multiple choice and true or false to examine the LLMs capacity for knowledge recall and comprehensive reasoning within the TCM domain. In our study we evaluate two settings of the LLM zero-shot and few-shot settings while concurrently discussing the differences between English and Chinese prompts. Our results indicate that ChatGPT performs best in true or false questions achieving the highest precision of 0.688 while scoring the lowest precision is 0.241 in multiple-choice questions. Furthermore we observed that Chinese prompts outperformed English prompts in our evaluations. Additionally we assess the quality of explanations generated by ChatGPT and their potential contribution to TCM knowledge comprehension. This paper offers valuable insights into the applicability of LLMs in specialized domains and paves the way for future research in leveraging these powerful models to advance TCM.

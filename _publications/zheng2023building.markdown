The integration of emotional support into various conversational scenarios presents profound societal benefits such as social interactions mental health counseling and customer service. However there are unsolved challenges that hinder real45;world applications in this field including limited data availability and the absence of well45;accepted model training paradigms. This work endeavors to navigate these challenges by harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We introduce an innovative methodology that synthesizes human insights with the computational prowess of LLMs to curate an extensive emotional support dialogue dataset. Our approach is initiated with a meticulously designed set of dialogues spanning diverse scenarios as generative seeds. By utilizing the in45;context learning potential of ChatGPT we recursively generate an ExTensible Emotional Support dialogue dataset named ExTES. Following this we deploy advanced tuning techniques on the LLaMA model examining the impact of diverse training strategies ultimately yielding an LLM meticulously optimized for emotional support interactions. An exhaustive assessment of the resultant model showcases its proficiency in offering emotional support marking a pivotal step in the realm of emotional support bots and paving the way for subsequent research and implementations.

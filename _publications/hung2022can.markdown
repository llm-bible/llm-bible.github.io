Demographic factors (e.g., gender or age) shape our language. Previous work
showed that incorporating demographic factors can consistently improve
performance for various NLP tasks with traditional NLP models. In this work, we
investigate whether these previous findings still hold with state-of-the-art
pretrained Transformer-based language models (PLMs). We use three common
specialization methods proven effective for incorporating external knowledge
into pretrained Transformers (e.g., domain-specific or geographic knowledge).
We adapt the language representations for the demographic dimensions of gender
and age, using continuous language modeling and dynamic multi-task learning for
adaptation, where we couple language modeling objectives with the prediction of
demographic classes. Our results, when employing a multilingual PLM, show
substantial gains in task performance across four languages (English, German,
French, and Danish), which is consistent with the results of previous work.
However, controlling for confounding factors - primarily domain and language
proficiency of Transformer-based PLMs - shows that downstream performance gains
from our demographic adaptation do not actually stem from demographic
knowledge. Our results indicate that demographic specialization of PLMs, while
holding promise for positive societal impact, still represents an unsolved
problem for (modern) NLP.

This paper explores the impact of context selection on the efficiency of
Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating Artificial Intelligence (AI)
research leaderboards, a task defined as the extraction of (Task, Dataset,
Metric, Score) quadruples from scholarly articles. By framing this challenge as
a text generation objective and employing instruction finetuning with the
FLAN-T5 collection, we introduce a novel method that surpasses traditional
Natural Language Inference (NLI) approaches in adapting to new developments
without a predefined taxonomy. Through experimentation with three distinct
context types of varying selectivity and length, our study demonstrates the
importance of effective context selection in enhancing LLM accuracy and
reducing hallucinations, providing a new pathway for the reliable and efficient
generation of AI leaderboards. This contribution not only advances the state of
the art in leaderboard generation but also sheds light on strategies to
mitigate common challenges in LLM-based information extraction.

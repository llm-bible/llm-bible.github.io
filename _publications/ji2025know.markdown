Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating human-like texts, but the potential misuse of such LLM-generated
texts raises the need to distinguish between human-generated and LLM-generated
content. This paper explores the detection and explanation capabilities of
LLM-based detectors of LLM-generated texts, in the context of a binary
classification task (human-generated texts vs LLM-generated texts) and a
ternary classification task (human-generated texts, LLM-generated texts, and
undecided). By evaluating on six close/open-source LLMs with different sizes,
our findings reveal that while self-detection consistently outperforms
cross-detection, i.e., LLMs can detect texts generated by themselves more
accurately than those generated by other LLMs, the performance of
self-detection is still far from ideal, indicating that further improvements
are needed. We also show that extending the binary to the ternary
classification task with a new class "Undecided" can enhance both detection
accuracy and explanation quality, with improvements being statistically
significant and consistent across all LLMs. We finally conducted comprehensive
qualitative and quantitative analyses on the explanation errors, which are
categorized into three types: reliance on inaccurate features (the most
frequent error), hallucinations, and incorrect reasoning. These findings with
our human-annotated dataset emphasize the need for further research into
improving both self-detection and self-explanation, particularly to address
overfitting issues that may hinder generalization.

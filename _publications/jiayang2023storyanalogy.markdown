Analogy-making between narratives is crucial for human reasoning. In this paper we evaluate the ability to identify and generate analogies by constructing a first-of-its-kind large-scale story-level analogy corpus which contains 24K story pairs from diverse domains with human annotations on two similarities from the extended Structure-Mapping Theory. We design a set of tests on presenting the first evaluation of story-level analogy identification and generation. Interestingly we find that the analogy identification tasks are incredibly difficult not only for sentence embedding models but also for the recent large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LLaMa. ChatGPT for example only achieved around 3037; accuracy in multiple-choice questions (compared to over 8537; accuracy for humans). Furthermore we observe that the data in can improve the quality of analogy generation in LLMs where a fine-tuned FlanT5-xxl model achieves comparable performance to zero-shot ChatGPT.

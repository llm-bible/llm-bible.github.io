In response to the increasing mental health challenges faced by college
students, we sought to understand their perspectives on how AI applications,
particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), can be leveraged to enhance their
mental well-being. Through pilot interviews with ten diverse students, we
explored their opinions on the use of LLMs across five fictional scenarios:
General Information Inquiry, Initial Screening, Reshaping Patient-Expert
Dynamics, Long-term Care, and Follow-up Care. Our findings revealed that
students' acceptance of LLMs varied by scenario, with participants highlighting
both potential benefits, such as proactive engagement and personalized
follow-up care, and concerns, including limitations in training data and
emotional support. These insights inform how AI technology should be designed
and implemented to effectively support and enhance students' mental well-being,
particularly in scenarios where LLMs can complement traditional methods, while
maintaining empathy and respecting individual preferences.

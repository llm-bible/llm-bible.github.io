In this paper we formulate a more realistic and difficult problem setup for the intent detection task in natural language understanding namely Generalized Few45;Shot Intent Detection (GFSID). GFSID aims to discriminate a joint label space consisting of both existing intents which have enough labeled data and novel intents which only have a few examples for each class. To approach this problem we propose a novel model Conditional Text Generation with BERT (CG45;BERT). CG45;BERT effectively leverages a large pre45;trained language model to generate text conditioned on the intent label. By modeling the utterance distribution with variational inference CG45;BERT can generate diverse utterances for the novel intents even with only a few utterances available. Experimental results show that CG45;BERT achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance on the GFSID task with 145;shot and 545;shot settings on two real45;world datasets.

Multi45;hop Question Generation (QG) aims to generate answer45;related questions by aggregating and reasoning over multiple scattered evidence from different paragraphs. It is a more challenging yet under45;explored task compared to conventional single45;hop QG where the questions are generated from the sentence containing the answer or nearby sentences in the same paragraph without complex reasoning. To address the additional challenges in multi45;hop QG we propose Multi45;Hop Encoding Fusion Network for Question Generation (MulQG) which does context encoding in multiple hops with Graph Convolutional Network and encoding fusion via an Encoder Reasoning Gate. To the best of our knowledge we are the first to tackle the challenge of multi45;hop reasoning over paragraphs without any sentence45;level information. Empirical results on HotpotQA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with baselines on automatic evaluation metrics. Moreover from the human evaluation our proposed model is able to generate fluent questions with high completeness and outperforms the strongest baseline by 20.837; in the multi45;hop evaluation. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/MulQG&#125;&#123;https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/MulQG .

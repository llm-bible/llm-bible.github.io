Humor plays a significant role in daily language communication. With the
rapid development of large language models (LLMs), natural language processing
has made significant strides in understanding and generating various genres of
texts. However, most LLMs exhibit poor performance in generating and processing
Chinese humor. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive Chinese
humor-related dataset, the Chinese Fun Set (CFunSet). This dataset aggregates
existing Chinese humor datasets and includes over 20,000 jokes collected from
Tieba-JokeBar, a Chinese online platform known for joke sharing. The resulting
corpus comprises more than 160,000 entries. Leveraging CFunSet, we developed
the Chinese Fun Model (CFunModel), the first large language model designed to
handle various Chinese humor-related tasks including Crosstalk Response
Selection, Humor Recognition, Joke Generation, etc. Experimental results
demonstrate that CFunModel outperforms popular large language models in these
tasks. Our CFunSet is available at

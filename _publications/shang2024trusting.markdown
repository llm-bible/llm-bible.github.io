Trust is not just a cognitive issue but also an emotional one, yet the
research in human-AI interactions has primarily focused on the cognitive route
of trust development. Recent work has highlighted the importance of studying
affective trust towards AI, especially in the context of emerging human-like
LLMs-powered conversational agents. However, there is a lack of validated and
generalizable measures for the two-dimensional construct of trust in AI agents.
To address this gap, we developed and validated a set of 27-item semantic
differential scales for affective and cognitive trust through a scenario-based
survey study. We then further validated and applied the scale through an
experiment study. Our empirical findings showed how the emotional and cognitive
aspects of trust interact with each other and collectively shape a person's
overall trust in AI agents. Our study methodology and findings also provide
insights into the capability of the state-of-art LLMs to foster trust through
different routes.

Recently large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks. However their effectiveness in the financial domain specifically in predicting stock market movements remains to be explored. In this paper we conduct an extensive zero45;shot analysis of ChatGPTs capabilities in multimodal stock movement prediction on three tweets and historical stock price datasets. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is a Wall Street Neophyte with limited success in predicting stock movements as it underperforms not only state45;of45;the45;art methods but also traditional methods like linear regression using price features. Despite the potential of Chain45;of45;Thought prompting strategies and the inclusion of tweets ChatGPTs performance remains subpar. Furthermore we observe limitations in its explainability and stability suggesting the need for more specialized training or fine45;tuning. This research provides insights into ChatGPTs capabilities and serves as a foundation for future work aimed at improving financial market analysis and prediction by leveraging social media sentiment and historical stock data.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated
remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks.
However, their effectiveness in the financial domain, specifically in
predicting stock market movements, remains to be explored. In this paper, we
conduct an extensive zero-shot analysis of ChatGPT's capabilities in multimodal
stock movement prediction, on three tweets and historical stock price datasets.
Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is a "Wall Street Neophyte" with limited
success in predicting stock movements, as it underperforms not only
state-of-the-art methods but also traditional methods like linear regression
using price features. Despite the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting
strategies and the inclusion of tweets, ChatGPT's performance remains subpar.
Furthermore, we observe limitations in its explainability and stability,
suggesting the need for more specialized training or fine-tuning. This research
provides insights into ChatGPT's capabilities and serves as a foundation for
future work aimed at improving financial market analysis and prediction by
leveraging social media sentiment and historical stock data.

In this work, we develop and release Llama 2, a collection of pretrained and
fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70
billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for
dialogue use cases. Our models outperform open-source chat models on most
benchmarks we tested, and based on our human evaluations for helpfulness and
safety, may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. We provide a
detailed description of our approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of
Llama 2-Chat in order to enable the community to build on our work and
contribute to the responsible development of LLMs.

This paper examines the transformative role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education and their potential as learning tools despite their inherent risks and limitations.

The aim is to help students learn with and about AI with practical strategies designed to mitigate risks such as complacency about the AIs output errors and biases. These strategies promote active oversight critical assessment of AI outputs and complementarity of AIs capabilities with the students unique insights. By challenging students to remain the human in the loop the authors aim to enhance learning outcomes while ensuring that AI serves as a supportive tool rather than a replacement. The proposed framework offers a guide for educators navigating the integration of AI45;assisted learning in classrooms

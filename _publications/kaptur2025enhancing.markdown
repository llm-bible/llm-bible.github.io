This research delved into GPT-4 and Kimi, two Large Language Models (LLMs),
for systematic reviews. We evaluated their performance by comparing
LLM-generated codes with human-generated codes from a peer-reviewed systematic
review on assessment. Our findings suggested that the performance of LLMs
fluctuates by data volume and question complexity for systematic reviews.

Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advances in the field of
natural language processing, but they still face challenges such as continuous
decision-making, lack of long-term memory, and limited context windows in
dynamic environments. To address these issues, this paper proposes an
innovative framework Memory-Enhanced Agents with Reflective Self-improvement.
The MARS framework comprises three agents: the User, the Assistant, and the
Checker. By integrating iterative feedback, reflective mechanisms, and a memory
optimization mechanism based on the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve, it
significantly enhances the agents capabilities in handling multi-tasking and
long-span information.

Large Language Models(LLMs) have revolutionized various applications in
natural language processing (NLP) by providing unprecedented text generation,
translation, and comprehension capabilities. However, their widespread
deployment has brought to light significant concerns regarding biases embedded
within these models. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of biases in
LLMs, aiming to provide an extensive review of the types, sources, impacts, and
mitigation strategies related to these biases. We systematically categorize
biases into several dimensions. Our survey synthesizes current research
findings and discusses the implications of biases in real-world applications.
Additionally, we critically assess existing bias mitigation techniques and
propose future research directions to enhance fairness and equity in LLMs. This
survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers, practitioners, and
policymakers concerned with addressing and understanding biases in LLMs.

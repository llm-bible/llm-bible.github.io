In this work we examine the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the
challenging setting of acting as a Minecraft agent. We apply and evaluate LLMs
in the builder and architect settings, introduce clarification questions and
examining the challenges and opportunities for improvement. In addition, we
present a platform for online interaction with the agents and an evaluation
against previous works.

Recommendation systems are ubiquitous from Spotify playlist suggestions to Amazon product suggestions. Nevertheless depending on the methodology or the dataset these systems typically fail to capture user preferences and generate general recommendations. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLM) offer promising results for analyzing user queries. However employing these models to capture user preferences and efficiency remains an open question. In this paper we propose LLMRS an LLM-based zero-shot recommender system where we employ pre-trained LLM to encode user reviews into a review score and generate user-tailored recommendations. We experimented with LLMRS on a real-world dataset the Amazon product reviews for software purchase use cases. The results show that LLMRS outperforms the ranking-based baseline model while successfully capturing meaningful information from product reviews thereby providing more reliable recommendations.

Extracting key concepts and their relationships from course information and
materials facilitates the provision of visualizations and recommendations for
learners who need to select the right courses to take from a large number of
courses. However, identifying and extracting themes manually is labor-intensive
and time-consuming. Previous machine learning-based methods to extract relevant
concepts from courses heavily rely on detailed course materials, which
necessitates labor-intensive preparation of course materials. This paper
investigates the potential of LLMs such as GPT in automatically generating
course concepts and their relations. Specifically, we design a suite of prompts
and provide GPT with the course information with different levels of detail,
thereby generating high-quality course concepts and identifying their
relations. Furthermore, we comprehensively evaluate the quality of the
generated concepts and relationships through extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the viability of LLMs as a tool for supporting educational content
selection and delivery.

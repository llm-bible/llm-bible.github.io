Large Language Model (LLM) based Generative AI systems have seen significant
progress in recent years. Integrating a knowledge retrieval architecture allows
for seamless integration of private data into publicly available Generative AI
systems using pre-trained LLM without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, Retrieval-Centric Generation (RCG) approach, a promising future
research direction that explicitly separates roles of LLMs and retrievers in
context interpretation and knowledge memorization, potentially leads to more
efficient implementation. SimplyRetrieve is an open-source tool with the goal
of providing a localized, lightweight, and user-friendly interface to these
sophisticated advancements to the machine learning community. SimplyRetrieve
features a GUI and API based RCG platform, assisted by a Private Knowledge Base
Constructor and a Retrieval Tuning Module. By leveraging these capabilities,
users can explore the potential of RCG for improving generative AI performance
while maintaining privacy standards. The tool is available at
https://github.com/RCGAI/SimplyRetrieve with an MIT license.

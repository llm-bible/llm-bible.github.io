Crafting effective prompts for code generation or editing with Large Language Models (LLMs) is not an easy task. Particularly the absence of immediate stable feedback during prompt crafting hinders effective interaction as users are left to mentally imagine possible outcomes until the code is generated. In response we introduce Language-Oriented Code Sketching an interactive approach that provides instant incremental feedback in the form of code sketches (i.e. incomplete code outlines) during prompt crafting. This approach converts a prompt into a code sketch by leveraging the inherent linguistic structures within the prompt and applying classic natural language processing techniques. The sketch then serves as an intermediate placeholder that not only previews the intended code structure but also guides the LLM towards the desired code thereby enhancing human-LLM interaction. We conclude by discussing the approachs applicability and future plans.

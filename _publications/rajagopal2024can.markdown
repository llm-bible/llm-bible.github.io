Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT and Claude are built upon language
models that are typically evaluated for accuracy on curated benchmark datasets.
Such evaluation paradigms measure predictive and reasoning capabilities of
language models but do not assess if they can provide information that is
useful to people. In this paper, we take some initial steps in developing an
evaluation paradigm that centers human understanding and decision-making. We
study the utility of generative AI systems in supporting people in a concrete
task - making sense of clinical reports and imagery in order to make a clinical
decision. We conducted a formative need-finding study in which participants
discussed chest computed tomography (CT) scans and associated radiology reports
of a fictitious close relative with a cardiothoracic radiologist. Using
thematic analysis of the conversation between participants and medical experts,
we identified commonly occurring themes across interactions, including
clarifying medical terminology, locating the problems mentioned in the report
in the scanned image, understanding disease prognosis, discussing the next
diagnostic steps, and comparing treatment options. Based on these themes, we
evaluated two state-of-the-art generative AI systems against the radiologist's
responses. Our results reveal variability in the quality of responses generated
by the models across various themes. We highlight the importance of
patient-facing generative AI systems to accommodate a diverse range of
conversational themes, catering to the real-world informational needs of
patients.

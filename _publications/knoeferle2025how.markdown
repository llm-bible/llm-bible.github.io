We discuss how desirable it is that Large Language Models (LLMs) be able to
adapt or align their language behavior with users who may be diverse in their
language use. User diversity may come about among others due to i) age
differences; ii) gender characteristics, and/or iii) multilingual experience,
and associated differences in language processing and use. We consider
potential consequences for usability, communication, and LLM development.

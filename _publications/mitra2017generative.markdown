Question Answering has come a long way from answer sentence selection relational QA to reading and comprehension. We shift our attention to generative question answering (gQA) by which we facilitate machine to read passages and answer questions by learning to generate the answers. We frame the problem as a generative task where the encoder being a network that models the relationship between question and passage and encoding them to a vector thus facilitating the decoder to directly form an abstraction of the answer. Not being able to retain facts and making repetitions are common mistakes that affect the overall legibility of answers. To counter these issues we employ copying mechanism and maintenance of coverage vector in our model respectively. Our results on MS-MARCO demonstrate its superiority over baselines and we also show qualitative examples where we improved in terms of correctness and readability

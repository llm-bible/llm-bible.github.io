Incorporating Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in
education can enhance teaching efficiency and enrich student learning. Current
LLM usage involves conversational user interfaces (CUIs) for tasks like
generating materials or providing feedback. However, this presents challenges
including the need for educator expertise in AI and CUIs, ethical concerns with
high-stakes decisions, and privacy risks. CUIs also struggle with complex
tasks. To address these, we propose transitioning from CUIs to user-friendly
applications leveraging LLMs via API calls. We present a framework for
ethically incorporating GenAI into educational tools and demonstrate its
application in our tool, Feedback Copilot, which provides personalized feedback
on student assignments. Our evaluation shows the effectiveness of this
approach, with implications for GenAI researchers, educators, and
technologists. This work charts a course for the future of GenAI in education.

We propose WorldSense, a benchmark designed to assess the extent to which
LLMs are consistently able to sustain tacit world models, by testing how they
draw simple inferences from descriptions of simple arrangements of entities.
Worldsense is a synthetic benchmark with three problem types, each with their
own trivial control, which explicitly avoids bias by decorrelating the abstract
structure of problems from the vocabulary and expressions, and by decorrelating
all problem subparts with the correct response. We run our benchmark on three
state-of-the-art chat-LLMs (GPT3.5, GPT4 and Llama2-chat) and show that these
models make errors even with as few as three objects. Furthermore, they have
quite heavy response biases, preferring certain responses irrespective of the
question. Errors persist even with chain-of-thought prompting and in-context
learning. Lastly, we show that while finetuning on similar problems does result
in substantial improvements -- within- and out-of-distribution -- the finetuned
models do not generalise beyond a constraint problem space.

In this work we develop and release Yuan 2.0 a series of large language models with parameters ranging from 2.1 billion to 102.6 billion. The Localized Filtering45;based Attention (LFA) is introduced to incorporate prior knowledge of local dependencies of natural language into Attention. A data filtering and generating system is presented to build pre45;training and fine45;tuning dataset in high quality. A distributed training method with non45;uniform pipeline parallel data parallel and optimizer parallel is proposed which greatly reduces the bandwidth requirements of intra45;node communication and achieves good performance in large45;scale distributed training. Yuan 2.0 models display impressive ability in code generation math problem45;solving and chatting compared with existing models. The latest version of YUAN 2.0 including model weights and source code is accessible at Github.

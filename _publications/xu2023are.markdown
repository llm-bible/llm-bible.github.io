Logical reasoning consistently plays a fundamental and significant role in the domains of knowledge engineering and artificial intelligence. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a noteworthy innovation in natural language processing (NLP) exhibiting impressive achievements across various classic NLP tasks. However the question of whether LLMs can effectively address the task of logical reasoning which requires gradual cognitive inference similar to human intelligence remains unanswered. To this end we aim to bridge this gap and provide comprehensive evaluations in this paper. Firstly to offer systematic evaluations we select fifteen typical logical reasoning datasets and organize them into deductive inductive abductive and mixed45;form reasoning settings. Considering the comprehensiveness of evaluations we include three representative LLMs (i.e. text45;davinci45;003 ChatGPT and BARD) and evaluate them on all selected datasets under zero45;shot one45;shot and three45;shot settings. Secondly different from previous evaluations relying only on simple metrics (e.g. accuracy) we propose fine45;level evaluations from objective and subjective manners covering both answers and explanations. Additionally to uncover the logical flaws of LLMs problematic cases will be attributed to five error types from two dimensions i.e. evidence selection process and reasoning process. Thirdly to avoid the influences of knowledge bias and purely focus on benchmarking the logical reasoning capability of LLMs we propose a new dataset with neutral content. It contains 3000 samples and covers deductive inductive and abductive settings. Based on the in45;depth evaluations this paper finally forms a general evaluation scheme of logical reasoning capability from six dimensions. It reflects the pros and cons of LLMs and gives guiding directions for future works.

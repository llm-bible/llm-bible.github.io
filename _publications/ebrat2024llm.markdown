Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems are often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), addresses this limitation by generating simulated user feedback. It synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items. In addition, user profiles are updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Using the MovieLens100K dataset as proof of concept, Lusifer demonstrates accurate emulation of user behavior and preferences. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates. While validating Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback, future research could utilize this environment to train reinforcement learning systems, offering a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online recommender systems.

Converging societal and technical factors have transformed language
technologies into user-facing applications employed across languages. Machine
Translation (MT) has become a global tool, with cross-lingual services now also
supported by dialogue systems powered by multilingual Large Language Models
(LLMs). This accessibility has expanded MT's reach to a vast base of lay users,
often with little to no expertise in the languages or the technology itself.
Despite this, the understanding of MT consumed by this diverse group of users
-- their needs, experiences, and interactions with these systems -- remains
limited. This paper traces the shift in MT user profiles, focusing on
non-expert users and how their engagement with these systems may change with
LLMs. We identify three key factors -- usability, trust, and literacy -- that
shape these interactions and must be addressed to align MT with user needs. By
exploring these dimensions, we offer insights to guide future MT with a
user-centered approach.

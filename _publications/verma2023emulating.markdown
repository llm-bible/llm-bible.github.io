In response to the pressing need for advanced clinical problem-solving tools in healthcare we introduce BooksMed a novel framework based on a Large Language Model (LLM). BooksMed uniquely emulates human cognitive processes to deliver evidence-based and reliable responses utilizing the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluations) framework to effectively quantify evidence strength. For clinical decision-making to be appropriately assessed an evaluation metric that is clinically aligned and validated is required. As a solution we present ExpertMedQA a multispecialty clinical benchmark comprised of open-ended expert-level clinical questions and validated by a diverse group of medical professionals. By demanding an in-depth understanding and critical appraisal of up-to-date clinical literature ExpertMedQA rigorously evaluates LLM performance. BooksMed outperforms existing state-of-the-art models Med-PaLM 2 Almanac and ChatGPT in a variety of medical scenarios. Therefore a framework that mimics human cognitive stages could be a useful tool for providing reliable and evidence-based responses to clinical inquiries.

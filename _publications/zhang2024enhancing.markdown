In this paper, we propose CitaLaw, the first benchmark designed to evaluate
LLMs' ability to produce legally sound responses with appropriate citations.
CitaLaw features a diverse set of legal questions for both laypersons and
practitioners, paired with a comprehensive corpus of law articles and precedent
cases as a reference pool. This framework enables LLM-based systems to retrieve
supporting citations from the reference corpus and align these citations with
the corresponding sentences in their responses. Moreover, we introduce
syllogism-inspired evaluation methods to assess the legal alignment between
retrieved references and LLM-generated responses, as well as their consistency
with user questions. Extensive experiments on 2 open-domain and 7
legal-specific LLMs demonstrate that integrating legal references substantially
enhances response quality. Furthermore, our proposed syllogism-based evaluation
method exhibits strong agreement with human judgments.

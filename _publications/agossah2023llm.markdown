In the past years, AI has seen many advances in the field of NLP. This has
led to the emergence of LLMs, such as the now famous GPT-3.5, which
revolutionise the way humans can access or generate content. Current studies on
LLM-based generative tools are mainly interested in the performance of such
tools in generating relevant content (code, text or image). However, ethical
concerns related to the design and use of generative tools seem to be growing,
impacting the public acceptability for specific tasks. This paper presents a
questionnaire survey to identify the intention to use generative tools by
employees of an IT company in the context of their work. This survey is based
on empirical models measuring intention to use (TAM by Davis, 1989, and UTAUT2
by Venkatesh and al., 2008). Our results indicate a rather average
acceptability of generative tools, although the more useful the tool is
perceived to be, the higher the intention to use seems to be. Furthermore, our
analyses suggest that the frequency of use of generative tools is likely to be
a key factor in understanding how employees perceive these tools in the context
of their work. Following on from this work, we plan to investigate the nature
of the requests that may be made to these tools by specific audiences.

Adapting large language models (LLMs) to diverse cultural values is a
challenging task, as existing LLMs often reflect the values of specific groups
by default, and potentially causing harm to others. In this paper, we present
CLCA, a novel framework for enhancing LLM alignment with cultural values based
on cultural learning. The framework leverages simulated social interactions to
generate conversations in which LLMs engage in role-playing within culturally
adapted social scenarios, capturing implicit cultural norms for model
fine-tuning. CLCA improves cultural value alignment across various model
architectures measured using World Value Survey data, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our results provide early evidence that
understanding intent and social interactions can enhance cultural value
adaptation in LLMs, highlighting the promise of training approaches based on
cultural learning.

Intelligent agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising these agents called scientific LLM agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that demand careful consideration for safety. However there exists a notable gap in the literature as there has been no comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective paper fills this gap by conducting a thorough examination of vulnerabilities in LLM-based agents within scientific domains shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing a comprehensive overview of the potential risks inherent to scientific LLM agents taking into account user intent the specific scientific domain and their potential impact on the external environment. Then we delve into the origins of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation agent alignment and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding scientific agents and advocate for the development of improved models robust benchmarks and comprehensive regulations to address these issues effectively.

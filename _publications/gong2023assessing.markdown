We propose a novel VQA dataset BloomVQA to facilitate comprehensive evaluation of large vision45;language models on comprehension tasks. Unlike current benchmarks that often focus on fact45;based memorization and simple reasoning tasks without theoretical grounding we collect multiple45;choice samples based on picture stories that reflect different levels of comprehension as laid out in Blooms Taxonomy a classic framework for learning assessment widely adopted in education research. Our data maps to a novel hierarchical graph representation which enables automatic data augmentation and novel measures characterizing model consistency. We perform graded evaluation and reliability analysis on recent multi45;modal models. In comparison to low45;level tasks we observe decreased performance on tasks requiring advanced comprehension and cognitive skills with up to 38.037; drop in VQA accuracy. In comparison to earlier models GPT45;4V demonstrates improved accuracy over all comprehension levels and shows a tendency of bypassing visual inputs especially for higher45;level tasks. Current models also show consistency patterns misaligned with human comprehension in various scenarios demonstrating the need for improvement based on theoretically45;grounded criteria.

The recent proliferation of AI-generated content has prompted significant
interest in developing reliable detection methods. This study explores
techniques for identifying AI-generated text through sentence-level evaluation
within hybrid articles. Our findings indicate that ChatGPT-3.5 Turbo exhibits
distinct, repetitive probability patterns that enable consistent in-domain
detection. Empirical tests show that minor textual modifications, such as
rewording, have minimal impact on detection accuracy. These results provide
valuable insights for advancing AI detection methodologies, offering a pathway
toward robust solutions to address the complexities of synthetic text
identification.

Cloze testing is a common method for measuring the behavior of large language models on a number of benchmark tasks. Using the MMLU dataset we show that the base-rate probability (BRP) differences across answer tokens are significant and affect task performance ie. guess A if uncertain. We find that counterfactual prompting does sufficiently mitigate the BRP effect. The BRP effect is found to have a similar effect to test taking strategies employed by humans leading to the conflation of task performance and test-taking ability. We propose the Nvr-X-MMLU task a variation of MMLU which helps to disambiguate test-taking ability from task performance and reports the latter.

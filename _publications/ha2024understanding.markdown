Large language models (LLMs) have facilitated significant strides in generating conversational agents enabling seamless contextually relevant dialogues across diverse topics. However the existing LLM-driven conversational agents have fixed personalities and functionalities limiting their adaptability to individual user needs. Creating personalized agent personas with distinct expertise or traits can address this issue. Nonetheless we lack knowledge of how people customize and interact with agent personas. In this research we investigated how users customize agent personas and their impact on interaction quality diversity and dynamics. To this end we developed CloChat an interface supporting easy and accurate customization of agent personas in LLMs. We conducted a study comparing how participants interact with CloChat and ChatGPT. The results indicate that participants formed emotional bonds with the customized agents engaged in more dynamic dialogues and showed interest in sustaining interactions. These findings contribute to design implications for future systems with conversational agents using LLMs.

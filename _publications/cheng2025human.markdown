Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential
across various domains, yet they face significant challenges in knowledge
integration and complex problem reasoning, often leading to hallucinations and
unreliable outputs. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
promising solution to enhance LLMs accuracy by incorporating external
knowledge. However, traditional RAG systems struggle with processing complex
relational information and multi-step reasoning, limiting their effectiveness
in advanced problem-solving tasks. To address these limitations, we propose
CogGRAG, a cognition inspired graph-based RAG framework, designed to improve
LLMs performance in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). Inspired by the
human cognitive process of decomposing complex problems and performing
self-verification, our framework introduces a three-stage methodology:
decomposition, retrieval, and reasoning with self-verification. By integrating
these components, CogGRAG enhances the accuracy of LLMs in complex problem
solving. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on four
benchmark datasets, where CogGRAG outperforms the baselines.

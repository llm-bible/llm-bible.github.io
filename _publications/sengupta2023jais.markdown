We introduce Jais and Jais45;chat new state45;of45;the45;art Arabic45;centric foundation and instruction45;tuned open generative large language models (LLMs). The models are based on the GPT45;3 decoder45;only architecture and are pretrained on a mixture of Arabic and English texts including source code in various programming languages. With 13 billion parameters they demonstrate better knowledge and reasoning capabilities in Arabic than any existing open Arabic and multilingual models by a sizable margin based on extensive evaluation. Moreover the models are competitive in English compared to English45;centric open models of similar size despite being trained on much less English data. We provide a detailed description of the training the tuning the safety alignment and the evaluation of the models. We release two open versions of the model 45;45; the foundation Jais model and an instruction45;tuned Jais45;chat variant 45;45; with the aim of promoting research on Arabic LLMs. Available at https://huggingface.co/inception&#45;mbzuai/jais&#45;13b&#45;chat

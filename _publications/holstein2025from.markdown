The rise of Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLMs) in particular, is
fundamentally changing cognitive processes in knowledge work, raising critical
questions about their impact on human reasoning and problem-solving
capabilities. As these AI systems become increasingly integrated into
workflows, they offer unprecedented opportunities for augmenting human thinking
while simultaneously risking cognitive erosion through passive consumption of
generated answers. This tension is particularly pronounced in open-ended tasks,
where effective solutions require deep contextualization and integration of
domain knowledge. Unlike structured tasks with established metrics, measuring
the quality of human-LLM interaction in such open-ended tasks poses significant
challenges due to the absence of ground truth and the iterative nature of
solution development. To address this, we present a framework that analyzes
interaction patterns along two dimensions: cognitive activity mode (exploration
vs. exploitation) and cognitive engagement mode (constructive vs. detrimental).
This framework provides systematic measurements to evaluate when LLMs are
effective tools for thought rather than substitutes for human cognition,
advancing theoretical understanding and practical guidance for developing AI
systems that protect and augment human cognitive capabilities.

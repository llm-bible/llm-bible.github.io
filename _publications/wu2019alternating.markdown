Existing dialog system models require extensive human annotations and are difficult to generalize to different tasks. The recent success of large pre45;trained language models such as BERT and GPT45;2 (Devlin et al. 2019; Radford et al. 2019) have suggested the effectiveness of incorporating language priors in down45;stream NLP tasks. However how much pre45;trained language models can help dialog response generation is still under exploration. In this paper we propose a simple general and effective framework Alternating Roles Dialog Model (ARDM). ARDM models each speaker separately and takes advantage of the large pre45;trained language model. It requires no supervision from human annotations such as belief states or dialog acts to achieve effective conversations. ARDM outperforms or is on par with state45;of45;the45;art methods on two popular task45;oriented dialog datasets CamRest676 and MultiWOZ. Moreover we can generalize ARDM to more challenging non45;collaborative tasks such as persuasion. In persuasion tasks ARDM is capable of generating human45;like responses to persuade people to donate to a charity.

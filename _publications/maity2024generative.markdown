Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing educational
technology by enabling highly personalized and adaptive learning environments
within Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). This report delves into the
integration of Generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) like
GPT-4, into ITS to enhance personalized education through dynamic content
generation, real-time feedback, and adaptive learning pathways. We explore key
applications such as automated question generation, customized feedback
mechanisms, and interactive dialogue systems that respond to individual learner
needs. The report also addresses significant challenges, including ensuring
pedagogical accuracy, mitigating inherent biases in AI models, and maintaining
learner engagement. Future directions highlight the potential advancements in
multimodal AI integration, emotional intelligence in tutoring systems, and the
ethical implications of AI-driven education. By synthesizing current research
and practical implementations, this report underscores the transformative
potential of Generative AI in creating more effective, equitable, and engaging
educational experiences.

Large45;scale pre45;trained language models such as GPT45;3 have shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However applying prompt45;based methods with GPT45;3 for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) tasks and their controllability remains underexplored. Controllability in GEC is crucial for real45;world applications particularly in educational settings where the ability to tailor feedback according to learner levels and specific error types can significantly enhance the learning process. This paper investigates the performance and controllability of prompt45;based methods with GPT45;3 for GEC tasks using zero45;shot and few45;shot setting. We explore the impact of task instructions and examples on GPT45;3s output focusing on controlling aspects such as minimal edits fluency edits and learner levels. Our findings demonstrate that GPT45;3 could effectively perform GEC tasks outperforming existing supervised and unsupervised approaches. We also showed that GPT45;3 could achieve controllability when appropriate task instructions and examples are given.

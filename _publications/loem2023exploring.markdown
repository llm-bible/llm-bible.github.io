Large-scale pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have shown remarkable performance across various natural language processing tasks. However applying prompt-based methods with GPT-3 for Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) tasks and their controllability remains underexplored. Controllability in GEC is crucial for real-world applications particularly in educational settings where the ability to tailor feedback according to learner levels and specific error types can significantly enhance the learning process. This paper investigates the performance and controllability of prompt-based methods with GPT-3 for GEC tasks using zero-shot and few-shot setting. We explore the impact of task instructions and examples on GPT-3s output focusing on controlling aspects such as minimal edits fluency edits and learner levels. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-3 could effectively perform GEC tasks outperforming existing supervised and unsupervised approaches. We also showed that GPT-3 could achieve controllability when appropriate task instructions and examples are given.

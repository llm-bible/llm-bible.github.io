This paper explores the intersection of technology and sleep pattern
comprehension, presenting a cutting-edge two-stage framework that harnesses the
power of Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective is to deliver
precise sleep predictions paired with actionable feedback, addressing the
limitations of existing solutions. This innovative approach involves leveraging
the GLOBEM dataset alongside synthetic data generated by LLMs. The results
highlight significant improvements, underlining the efficacy of merging
advanced machine-learning techniques with a user-centric design ethos. Through
this exploration, we bridge the gap between technological sophistication and
user-friendly design, ensuring that our framework yields accurate predictions
and translates them into actionable insights.

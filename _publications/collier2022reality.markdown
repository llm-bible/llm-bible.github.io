Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) harness linguistic associations in vast natural language data for practical applications. However their ability to understand the physical world using only language data remains a question. After reviewing existing protocols we explore this question using a novel and tightly controlled reasoning test (ART) and compare human norms against versions of GPT-3. Our findings highlight the categories of common-sense relations models that could learn directly from data and areas of weakness. GPT-3 offers evidence for verbal reasoning on a par with human subjects for several relations including Synonymy Antonymy and Default inheritance Without reinforcement learning from human judgements it appears GPT-3 performs at the lower end of the reference interval for Has-part and Contained-in. Weaknesses were observed also in affordance characteristics through Necessary-quality Order-of-size and Order-of-intensity. Combining LLMs with symbolic world grounding is a promising direction to address associative learning.

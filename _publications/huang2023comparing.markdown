Automated coaching messages for weight control can save time and costs but their repetitive generic nature may limit their effectiveness compared to human coaching. Large language model (LLM) based artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots like ChatGPT could offer more personalized and novel messages to address repetition with their data45;processing abilities. While LLM AI demonstrates promise to encourage healthier lifestyles studies have yet to examine the feasibility and acceptability of LLM45;based BWL coaching. 87 adults in a weight45;loss trial rated ten coaching messages helpfulness (five human45;written five ChatGPT45;generated) using a 545;point Likert scale providing additional open45;ended feedback to justify their ratings. Participants also identified which messages they believed were AI45;generated. The evaluation occurred in two phases messages in Phase 1 were perceived as impersonal and negative prompting revisions for Phase 2 messages. In Phase 1 AI45;generated messages were rated less helpful than human45;written ones with 66 percent receiving a helpfulness rating of 3 or higher. However in Phase 2 the AI messages matched the human45;written ones regarding helpfulness with 8237; scoring three or above. Additionally 5037; were misidentified as human45;written suggesting AIs sophistication in mimicking human45;generated content. A thematic analysis of open45;ended feedback revealed that participants appreciated AIs empathy and personalized suggestions but found them more formulaic less authentic and too data45;focused. This study reveals the preliminary feasibility and acceptability of LLM AIs like ChatGPT in crafting potentially effective weight control coaching messages. Our findings also underscore areas for future enhancement.

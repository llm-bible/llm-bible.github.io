When reading long45;form text human cognition is complex and structurized. While large language models (LLMs) process input contexts through a causal and sequential perspective this approach can potentially limit their ability to handle intricate and complex inputs effectively. To enhance LLMs cognition capability this paper presents a novel concept of context structurization. Specifically we transform the plain unordered contextual sentences into well45;ordered and hierarchically structurized elements. By doing so LLMs can better grasp intricate and extended contexts through precise attention and information45;seeking along the organized structures. Extensive evaluations are conducted across various model architectures and sizes (including several 7B45; to 72B45;size auto45;regressive LLMs as well as BERT45;like masking models) on a diverse set of NLP tasks (e.g. context45;based question45;answering exhaustive hallucination evaluation and passage45;level dense retrieval). Empirical results show consistent and significant performance gains afforded by a single45;round structurization. In particular we boost a 72B45;parameter open45;source model to achieve comparable performance against GPT45;3.545;Turbo as the hallucination evaluator. Besides we show the feasibility of distilling advanced LLMs language processing abilities to a smaller yet effective StruXGPT45;7B to execute structurization addressing the practicality of our approach. Code will be made public soon.

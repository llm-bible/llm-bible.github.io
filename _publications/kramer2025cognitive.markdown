Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong language generation
capabilities but often struggle with structured reasoning, leading to
inconsistent or suboptimal problem-solving. To mitigate this limitation,
Guilford's Structure of Intellect (SOI) model - a foundational framework from
intelligence theory - is leveraged as the basis for cognitive prompt
engineering. The SOI model categorizes cognitive operations such as pattern
recognition, memory retrieval, and evaluation, offering a systematic approach
to enhancing LLM reasoning and decision-making. This position paper presents a
novel cognitive prompting approach for enforcing SOI-inspired reasoning for
improving clarity, coherence, and adaptability in model responses.

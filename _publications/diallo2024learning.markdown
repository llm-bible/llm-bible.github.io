Understanding procedural texts, such as cooking recipes, is essential for
enabling machines to follow instructions and reason about tasks, a key aspect
of intelligent reasoning. In cooking, these instructions can be interpreted as
a series of modifications to a food preparation. For a model to effectively
reason about cooking recipes, it must accurately discern and understand the
inputs and outputs of intermediate steps within the recipe. We present a new
corpus of cooking recipes enriched with descriptions of intermediate steps that
describe the input and output for each step. PizzaCommonsense serves as a
benchmark for the reasoning capabilities of LLMs because it demands rigorous
explicit input-output descriptions to demonstrate the acquisition of implicit
commonsense knowledge, which is unlikely to be easily memorized. GPT-4 achieves
only 26% human-evaluated preference for generations, leaving room for future
improvements.

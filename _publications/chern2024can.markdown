Despite the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks and scenarios developing a method for reliably evaluating LLMs across varied contexts continues to be challenging. Modern evaluation approaches often use LLMs to assess responses generated by LLMs. However the meta45;evaluation conducted to assess the effectiveness of these LLMs as evaluators is typically constrained by the coverage of existing benchmarks or requires extensive human annotation. This underscores the urgency of methods for scalable meta45;evaluation that can effectively reliably and efficiently evaluate the performance of LLMs as evaluators across diverse tasks and scenarios particularly in potentially new user45;defined scenarios. To fill this gap we propose ScaleEval an agent45;debate45;assisted meta45;evaluation framework that leverages the capabilities of multiple communicative LLM agents. This framework supports multi45;round discussions to assist human annotators in discerning the most capable LLMs as evaluators which significantly eases their workload in cases that used to require large45;scale annotations during meta45;evaluation. We release the code for our framework which is publicly available at url123;https://github.com/GAIR&#45;NLP/scaleeval&#125;.

The advancements in systems deploying large language models (LLMs), as well
as improvements in their ability to act as agents with predefined templates,
provide an opportunity to conduct qualitative, individualized assessments,
creating a bridge between qualitative and quantitative methods for candidates
seeking career progression. In this paper, we develop a platform that allows
candidates to run AI-led interviews to assess their current career stage and
curate coursework to enable progression to the next level. Our approach
incorporates predefined career trajectories, associated skills, and a method to
recommend the best resources for gaining the necessary skills for advancement.
We employ OpenAI API calls along with expertly compiled chat templates to
assess candidate competence. Our platform is highly configurable due to the
modularity of the development, is easy to deploy and use, and available as a
web interface where the only requirement is candidate resumes in PDF format. We
demonstrate a use-case centered on software engineering and intend to extend
this platform to be domain-agnostic, requiring only regular updates to chat
templates as industries evolve.

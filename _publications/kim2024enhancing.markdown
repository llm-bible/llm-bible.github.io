We introduce a pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform single45;turn psychotherapy counseling sessions into multi45;turn interactions. While AI45;supported online counseling services for individuals with mental disorders exist they are often constrained by the limited availability of multi45;turn training datasets and frequently fail to fully utilize therapists expertise. Our proposed pipeline effectively addresses these limitations. The pipeline comprises two main steps 1) Information Extraction and 2) Multi45;turn Counseling Generation. Each step is meticulously designed to extract and generate comprehensive multi45;turn counseling conversations from the available datasets. Experimental results from both zero45;shot and few45;shot generation scenarios demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to produce higher quality multi45;turn dialogues in the context of mental health counseling. Our pipeline and dataset are publicly available https://github.com/jwkim&#45;chat/A&#45;Data&#45;Augmentation&#45;Pipeline&#45;Leveraging&#45;Large&#45;Language&#45;Models&#45;for&#45;Counseling&#45;Conversations.

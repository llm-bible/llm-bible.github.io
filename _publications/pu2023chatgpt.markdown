Large-scale language models like ChatGPT have garnered significant media attention and stunned the public with their remarkable capacity for generating coherent text from short natural language prompts. In this paper we aim to conduct a systematic inspection of ChatGPTs performance in two controllable generation tasks with respect to ChatGPTs ability to adapt its output to different target audiences (expert vs. layman) and writing styles (formal vs. informal). Additionally we evaluate the faithfulness of the generated text and compare the models performance with human-authored texts. Our findings indicate that the stylistic variations produced by humans are considerably larger than those demonstrated by ChatGPT and the generated texts diverge from human samples in several characteristics such as the distribution of word types. Moreover we observe that ChatGPT sometimes incorporates factual errors or hallucinations when adapting the text to suit a specific style.

Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular in the field
of psychological counseling. However, when human therapists work with LLMs in
therapy sessions, it is hard to understand how the model gives the answers. To
address this, we have constructed Psy-COT, a graph designed to visualize the
thought processes of LLMs during therapy sessions. The Psy-COT graph presents
semi-structured counseling conversations alongside step-by-step annotations
that capture the reasoning and insights of therapists. Moreover, we have
developed Psy-Copilot, which is a conversational AI assistant designed to
assist human psychological therapists in their consultations. It can offer
traceable psycho-information based on retrieval, including response candidates,
similar dialogue sessions, related strategies, and visual traces of results. We
have also built an interactive platform for AI-assisted counseling. It has an
interface that displays the relevant parts of the retrieval sub-graph. The
Psy-Copilot is designed not to replace psychotherapists but to foster
collaboration between AI and human therapists, thereby promoting mental health
development. Our code and demo are both open-sourced and available for use.

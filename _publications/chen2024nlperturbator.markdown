Large language models (LLMs) achieve promising results in code generation based on a given natural language description. They have been integrated into open-source projects and commercial products to facilitate daily coding activities. The natural language description in the prompt is crucial for LLMs to comprehend users requirements. Prior studies uncover that LLMs are sensitive to the changes in the prompts including slight changes that look inconspicuous. However the natural language descriptions often vary in real-world scenarios (e.g. different formats grammar and wording). Prior studies on the robustness of LLMs are often based on random perturbations and such perturbations may not actually happen. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive study to investigate how are code LLMs robust to variations of natural language description in real-world scenarios. We summarize 18 categories of perturbations of natural language and 3 combinations of co-occurred categories based on our literature review and an online survey with practitioners. We propose an automated framework NLPerturbator which can perform perturbations of each category given a set of prompts. Through a series of experiments on code generation using six code LLMs we find that the perturbed prompts can decrease the performance of code generation by a considerable margin (e.g. up to 21.2 and 4.8 to 6.1 on average). Our study highlights the importance of enhancing the robustness of LLMs to real-world variations in the prompts as well as the essentiality of attentively constructing the prompts.

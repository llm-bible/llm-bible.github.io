Collaboration is ubiquitous and essential in day-to-day life -- from
exchanging ideas, to delegating tasks, to generating plans together. This work
studies how LLMs can adaptively collaborate to perform complex embodied
reasoning tasks. To this end we introduce MINDcraft, an easily extensible
platform built to enable LLM agents to control characters in the open-world
game of Minecraft; and MineCollab, a benchmark to test the different dimensions
of embodied and collaborative reasoning. An experimental study finds that the
primary bottleneck in collaborating effectively for current state-of-the-art
agents is efficient natural language communication, with agent performance
dropping as much as 15% when they are required to communicate detailed task
completion plans. We conclude that existing LLM agents are ill-optimized for
multi-agent collaboration, especially in embodied scenarios, and highlight the
need to employ methods beyond in-context and imitation learning. Our website

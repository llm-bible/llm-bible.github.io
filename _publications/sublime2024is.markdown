The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) such as ChatGPT has recently and profoundly impacted education, offering
transformative opportunities while raising significant concerns. In this study
we present the results of a survey that investigates how 395 students aged 13
to 25 years old in France and Italy integrate LLMs into their educational
routines.
  Key findings include the widespread use of these tools across all age groups
and disciplines, with older students and male students demonstrating higher
usage frequencies, particularly in scientific contexts. The results also show
gender disparities, raising concerns about an emerging AI literacy and
technological gender gap. Additionally, while most students utilise LLMs
constructively, the lack of systematic proofreading and critical evaluation
among younger users suggests potential risks to cognitive skills development,
including critical thinking and foundational knowledge. The survey results
underscore the need for educational institutions to adapt their curricula to
integrate AI tools effectively, promoting ethical use, critical thinking, and
awareness of AI limitations and environmental costs. This paper provides
actionable recommendations for fostering equitable and effective cohabitation
of LLMs and education while addressing emerging challenges.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are currently under exploration for various tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) Machine Translation (MT) and even End-to-End Speech Translation (ST). In this paper we present KITs offline submission in the constrained + LLM track by incorporating recently proposed techniques that can be added to any cascaded speech translation. Specifically we integrate Mistral-7B into our system to enhance it in two ways. Firstly we refine the ASR outputs by utilizing the N-best lists generated by our system and fine-tuning the LLM to predict the transcript accurately. Secondly we refine the MT outputs at the document level by fine-tuning the LLM leveraging both ASR and MT predictions to improve translation quality. We find that integrating the LLM into the ASR and MT systems results in an absolute improvement of 0.3 in Word Error Rate and 0.65 in COMET for tst2019 test set. In challenging test sets with overlapping speakers and background noise we find that integrating LLM is not beneficial due to poor ASR performance. Here we use ASR with chunked long-form decoding to improve context usage that may be unavailable when transcribing with Voice Activity Detection segmentation alone.

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, trained on huge amount of
datasets spanning multiple domains, exhibit significant reasoning,
understanding, and planning capabilities across various tasks. This study
presents the first-ever work in Arabic language integration within the
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) domain in robotics, an area that has been
notably underexplored in existing research. We perform a comprehensive
evaluation of state-of-the-art multi-lingual Small Language Models (SLMs),
including GPT-4o mini, Llama 3 8B, and Phi-3 medium 14B, alongside the
Arabic-centric LLM, Jais. Our approach utilizes the NavGPT framework, a pure
LLM-based instruction-following navigation agent, to assess the impact of
language on navigation reasoning through zero-shot sequential action prediction
using the R2R dataset. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that
our framework is capable of high-level planning for navigation tasks when
provided with instructions in both English and Arabic. However, certain models
struggled with reasoning and planning in the Arabic language due to inherent
limitations in their capabilities, sub-optimal performance, and parsing issues.
These findings highlight the importance of enhancing planning and reasoning
capabilities in language models for effective navigation, emphasizing this as a
key area for further development while also unlocking the potential of
Arabic-language models for impactful real-world applications.

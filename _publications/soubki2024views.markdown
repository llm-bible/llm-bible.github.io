Evaluating the theory of mind (ToM) capabilities of language models (LMs) has
recently received a great deal of attention. However, many existing benchmarks
rely on synthetic data, which risks misaligning the resulting experiments with
human behavior. We introduce the first ToM dataset based on naturally occurring
spoken dialogs, Common-ToM, and show that LMs struggle to demonstrate ToM. We
then show that integrating a simple, explicit representation of beliefs
improves LM performance on Common-ToM.

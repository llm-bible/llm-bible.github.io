Effective patient-provider communication is crucial in clinical care,
directly impacting patient outcomes and quality of life. Traditional evaluation
methods, such as human ratings, patient feedback, and provider
self-assessments, are often limited by high costs and scalability issues.
Although existing natural language processing (NLP) techniques show promise,
they struggle with the nuances of clinical communication and require sensitive
clinical data for training, reducing their effectiveness in real-world
applications. Emerging large language models (LLMs) offer a new approach to
assessing complex communication metrics, with the potential to advance the
field through integration into passive sensing and just-in-time intervention
systems. This study explores LLMs as evaluators of palliative care
communication quality, leveraging their linguistic, in-context learning, and
reasoning capabilities. Specifically, using simulated scripts crafted and
labeled by healthcare professionals, we test proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4)
and fine-tune open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA2) with a synthetic dataset
generated by GPT-4 to evaluate clinical conversations, to identify key metrics
such as `understanding' and `empathy'. Our findings demonstrated LLMs' superior
performance in evaluating clinical communication, providing actionable feedback
with reasoning, and demonstrating the feasibility and practical viability of
developing in-house LLMs. This research highlights LLMs' potential to enhance
patient-provider interactions and lays the groundwork for downstream steps in
developing LLM-empowered clinical health systems.

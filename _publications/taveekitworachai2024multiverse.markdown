This paper presents Dynamic Context Prompting/Programming (DCP/P), a novel
framework for interacting with LLMs to generate graph-based content with a
dynamic context window history. While there is an existing study utilizing LLMs
to generate a visual novel game, the previous study involved a manual process
of output extraction and did not provide flexibility in generating a longer,
coherent story. We evaluate DCP/P against our baseline, which does not provide
context history to an LLM and only relies on the initial story data. Through
objective evaluation, we show that simply providing the LLM with a summary
leads to a subpar story compared to additionally providing the LLM with the
proper context of the story. We also provide an extensive qualitative analysis
and discussion. We qualitatively examine the quality of the objectively
best-performing generated game from each approach. In addition, we examine
biases in word choices and word sentiment of the generated content. We find a
consistent observation with previous studies that LLMs are biased towards
certain words, even with a different LLM family. Finally, we provide a
comprehensive discussion on opportunities for future studies.

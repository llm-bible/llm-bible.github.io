This paper discusses OpenAIs ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer,
which uses natural language processing to fulfill text-based user requests
(i.e., a chatbot). The history and principles behind ChatGPT and similar models
are discussed. This technology is then discussed in relation to its potential
impact on academia and scholarly research and publishing. ChatGPT is seen as a
potential model for the automated preparation of essays and other types of
scholarly manuscripts. Potential ethical issues that could arise with the
emergence of large language models like GPT-3, the underlying technology behind
ChatGPT, and its usage by academics and researchers, are discussed and situated
within the context of broader advancements in artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and natural language processing for research and scholarly
publishing.

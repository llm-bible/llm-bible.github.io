Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated the
capability to generate human like, natural responses across a range of tasks,
including task oriented dialogue and question answering. However, their
application in real world, critical scenarios is often hindered by a tendency
to produce inaccurate information and a limited ability to leverage external
knowledge sources. This paper introduces the LLM ENHANCER system, designed to
integrate multiple online sources such as Google, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to
enhance data accuracy. The LLMs employed within this system are open source.
The data acquisition process for the LLM ENHANCER system operates in parallel,
utilizing custom agent tools to manage the flow of information. Vector
embeddings are used to identify the most pertinent information, which is
subsequently supplied to the LLM for user interaction. The LLM ENHANCER system
mitigates hallucinations in chat based LLMs while preserving response
naturalness and accuracy.

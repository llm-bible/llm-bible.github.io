This paper introduces a novel integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with Extended Reality (XR)
technologies to address knowledge transfer challenges in industrial
environments. The proposed system embeds domain-specific industrial knowledge
into XR environments through a natural language interface, enabling hands-free,
context-aware expert guidance for workers. We present the architecture of the
proposed system consisting of an LLM Chat Engine with dynamic tool
orchestration and an XR application featuring voice-driven interaction.
Performance evaluation of various chunking strategies, embedding models, and
vector databases reveals that semantic chunking, balanced embedding models, and
efficient vector stores deliver optimal performance for industrial knowledge
retrieval. The system's potential is demonstrated through early implementation
in multiple industrial use cases, including robotic assembly, smart
infrastructure maintenance, and aerospace component servicing. Results indicate
potential for enhancing training efficiency, remote assistance capabilities,
and operational guidance in alignment with Industry 5.0's human-centric and
resilient approach to industrial development.

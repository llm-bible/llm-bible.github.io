Learning is a key motivator behind information search behavior. With the
emergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these
tools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge. However, the
transition from traditional resources like textbooks and web searches raises
concerns among educators. They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead
students to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we
systematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In
response to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92
university students to compare three learning sources with different automation
levels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key
concepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in
knowledge retention was limited. Additionally, we found that academic
performance impacted both learning outcomes and search patterns. Notably,
higher-competence learners engaged more deeply with content through
reading-intensive behaviors rather than relying on search activities.

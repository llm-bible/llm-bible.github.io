As Large Language Models (LLMs) scale to longer context windows, the
computational cost of attention mechanisms, which traditionally grows
quadratically with input length, presents a critical challenge for real-time
and memory-constrained deployments. Existing sparse attention techniques have
sought to reduce this complexity, but they often incur significant overhead or
compromise accuracy, making them less practical for large contexts on mid-range
hardware. In this paper, we introduce SparseAccelerate, a dynamic sparse
attention method that adapts its sparsity patterns based on input
characteristics, effectively flattening the attention complexity curve. Our
approach is effective for input lengths starting at 16K tokens and scales
efficiently up to 128K tokens on dual NVIDIA A5000 GPUs (24GB each).
Experimental results show that SparseAccelerate achieves up to a 1.04x
reduction in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) latency at 32K tokens, while also
providing substantial memory savings. These improvements yield practical gains
for memory-intensive applications and long-context tasks that were previously
infeasible with standard attention. Beyond latency reductions, SparseAccelerate
fundamentally shifts the scaling trend, demonstrating the smallest TTFT growth
gradient relative to context length among competing methods. Ongoing
evaluations on diverse benchmarks confirm its scalability, positioning
SparseAccelerate as a critical advancement toward efficient, real-time, and
large-context LLM inference on accessible hardware.

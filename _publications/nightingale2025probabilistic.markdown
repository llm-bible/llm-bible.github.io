Representing token embeddings as probability distributions over learned
manifolds allows for more flexible contextual inference, reducing
representational rigidity while enhancing semantic granularity. Comparative
evaluations demonstrate that probabilistic embeddings improve neighborhood
consistency and decrease redundancy, ensuring that token relationships remain
more structurally coherent across fine-tuning iterations. The integration of
probabilistic subspaces within attention mechanisms facilitates more adaptive
contextual weighting, enabling models to capture latent dependencies that would
otherwise be obscured in conventional embeddings. Experimental results
highlight increased robustness against adversarial modifications, with
probabilistic embeddings preserving contextual integrity even under
perturbation-based evaluation scenarios. Performance assessments indicate that
probabilistic representations achieve greater adaptability in domain-specific
applications, mitigating the need for extensive retraining when shifting across
linguistic domains. Computational trade-offs remain within operationally
feasible limits, with marginal increases in inference latency balanced against
the benefits of enhanced representation stability and contextual
expressiveness. The capacity to encode structured uncertainty provides
advantages in generative modeling tasks, particularly where maintaining
coherence across extended sequences requires a representation framework capable
of handling ambiguous or context-dependent linguistic constructs.

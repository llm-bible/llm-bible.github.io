The recent success of large language models (LLMs) trained on static pre45;collected general datasets has sparked numerous research directions and applications. One such direction addresses the non45;trivial challenge of integrating pre45;trained LLMs into dynamic data distributions task structures and user preferences. Pre45;trained LLMs when tailored for specific needs often experience significant performance degradation in previous knowledge domains 45;45; a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. While extensively studied in the continual learning (CL) community it presents new manifestations in the realm of LLMs. In this survey we provide a comprehensive overview of the current research progress on LLMs within the context of CL. This survey is structured into four main sections we first describe an overview of continually learning LLMs consisting of two directions of continuity vertical continuity (or vertical continual learning) i.e. continual adaptation from general to specific capabilities and horizontal continuity (or horizontal continual learning) i.e. continual adaptation across time and domains (Section 3). We then summarize three stages of learning LLMs in the context of modern CL Continual Pre45;Training (CPT) Domain45;Adaptive Pre45;training (DAP) and Continual Fine45;Tuning (CFT) (Section 4). Then we provide an overview of evaluation protocols for continual learning with LLMs along with the current available data sources (Section 5). Finally we discuss intriguing questions pertaining to continual learning for LLMs (Section 6).

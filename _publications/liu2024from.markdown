The distinction between humans and animals lies in the unique ability of humans to use and create tools. Tools empower humans to overcome physiological limitations fostering the creation of magnificent civilizations. Similarly enabling foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to learn external tool usage may serve as a pivotal step toward realizing artificial general intelligence. Previous studies in this field have predominantly pursued two distinct approaches to augment the tool invocation capabilities of LLMs. The first approach emphasizes the construction of relevant datasets for model fine-tuning. The second approach in contrast aims to fully exploit the inherent reasoning abilities of LLMs through in-context learning strategies. In this work we introduce a novel tool invocation pipeline designed to control massive real-world APIs. This pipeline mirrors the human task-solving process addressing complicated real-life user queries. At each step we guide LLMs to summarize the achieved results and determine the next course of action. We term this pipeline from Summary to action Sum2Act for short. Empirical evaluations of our Sum2Act pipeline on the ToolBench benchmark show significant performance improvements outperforming established methods like ReAct and DFSDT. This highlights Sum2Acts effectiveness in enhancing LLMs for complex real-world tasks.

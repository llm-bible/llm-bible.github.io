In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity due to their ability to generate human-like text and their potential applications in various fields such as Software Engineering. LLMs for Code are commonly trained on large unsanitized corpora of source code scraped from the Internet. The content of these datasets is memorized and emitted by the models often in a verbatim manner. In this work we will discuss the security privacy and licensing implications of memorization. We argue why the use of copyleft code to train LLMs is a legal and ethical dilemma. Finally we provide four actionable recommendations to address this issue.

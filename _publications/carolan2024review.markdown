Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a focal point of research and application driven by their unprecedented ability to understand and generate text with human45;like quality. Even more recently LLMs have been extended into multi45;modal large language models (MM45;LLMs) which extends their capabilities to deal with image video and audio information in addition to text. This opens up applications like text45;to45;video generation image captioning text45;to45;speech and more and is achieved either by retro45;fitting an LLM with multi45;modal capabilities or building a MM45;LLM from scratch. This paper provides an extensive review of the current state of those LLMs with multi45;modal capabilities as well as the very recent MM45;LLMs. It covers the historical development of LLMs especially the advances enabled by transformer45;based architectures like OpenAIs GPT series and Googles BERT as well as the role of attention mechanisms in enhancing model performance. The paper includes coverage of the major and most important of the LLMs and MM45;LLMs and also covers the techniques of model tuning including fine45;tuning and prompt engineering which tailor pre45;trained models to specific tasks or domains. Ethical considerations and challenges such as data bias and model misuse are also analysed to underscore the importance of responsible AI development and deployment. Finally we discuss the implications of open45;source versus proprietary models in AI research. Through this review we provide insights into the transformative potential of MM45;LLMs in various applications.

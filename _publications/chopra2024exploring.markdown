The widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) has led to their speedy adoption. Conversational interactions with LLMs enable programmers to obtain natural language explanations for various software development tasks. However LLMs often leap to action without sufficient context giving rise to implicit assumptions and inaccurate responses. Conversations between developers and LLMs are primarily structured as question45;answer pairs where the developer is responsible for asking the the right questions and sustaining conversations across multiple turns. In this paper we draw inspiration from interaction patterns and conversation analysis 45;45; to design Robin an enhanced conversational AI45;assistant for debugging. Through a within45;subjects user study with 12 industry professionals we find that equipping the LLM to 45;45; (1) leverage the insert expansion interaction pattern (2) facilitate turn45;taking and (3) utilize debugging workflows 45;45; leads to lowered conversation barriers effective fault localization and 5x improvement in bug resolution rates.

Natural language is generated by people yet traditional language modeling views words or documents as if generated independently. Here we propose human language modeling (HuLM) a hierarchical extension to the language modeling problem whereby a human45;level exists to connect sequences of documents (e.g. social media messages) and capture the notion that human language is moderated by changing human states. We introduce HaRT a large45;scale transformer model for the HuLM task pre45;trained on approximately 100000 social media users and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of both language modeling (perplexity) for social media and fine45;tuning for 4 downstream tasks spanning document45; and user45;levels stance detection sentiment classification age estimation and personality assessment. Results on all tasks meet or surpass the current state45;of45;the45;art.

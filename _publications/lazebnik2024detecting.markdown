Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have significantly
reshaped text generation, particularly in the realm of writing assistance.
While ethical considerations underscore the importance of transparently
acknowledging LLM use, especially in scientific communication, genuine
acknowledgment remains infrequent. A potential avenue to encourage accurate
acknowledging of LLM-assisted writing involves employing automated detectors.
Our evaluation of four cutting-edge LLM-generated text detectors reveals their
suboptimal performance compared to a simple ad-hoc detector designed to
identify abrupt writing style changes around the time of LLM proliferation. We
contend that the development of specialized detectors exclusively dedicated to
LLM-assisted writing detection is necessary. Such detectors could play a
crucial role in fostering more authentic recognition of LLM involvement in
scientific communication, addressing the current challenges in acknowledgment
practices.

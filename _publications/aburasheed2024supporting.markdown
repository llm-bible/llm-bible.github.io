Student commitment towards a learning recommendation is not separable from their understanding of the reasons it was recommended to them; and their ability to modify it based on that understanding. Among explainability approaches chatbots offer the potential to engage the student in a conversation similar to a discussion with a peer or a mentor. The capabilities of chatbots however are still not sufficient to replace a human mentor despite the advancements of generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLM). Therefore we propose an approach to utilize chatbots as mediators of the conversation and sources of limited and controlled generation of explanations to harvest the potential of LLMs while reducing their potential risks at the same time. The proposed LLM45;based chatbot supports students in understanding learning45;paths recommendations. We use a knowledge graph (KG) as a human45;curated source of information to regulate the LLMs output through defining its prompts context. A group chat approach is developed to connect students with human mentors either on demand or in cases that exceed the chatbots pre45;defined tasks. We evaluate the chatbot with a user study to provide a proof45;of45;concept and highlight the potential requirements and limitations of utilizing chatbots in conversational explainability.

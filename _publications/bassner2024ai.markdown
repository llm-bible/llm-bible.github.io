Integrating AI-driven tools in higher education is an emerging area with
transformative potential. This paper introduces Iris, a chat-based virtual
tutor integrated into the interactive learning platform Artemis that offers
personalized, context-aware assistance in large-scale educational settings.
Iris supports computer science students by guiding them through programming
exercises and is designed to act as a tutor in a didactically meaningful way.
Its calibrated assistance avoids revealing complete solutions, offering subtle
hints or counter-questions to foster independent problem-solving skills. For
each question, it issues multiple prompts in a Chain-of-Thought to
GPT-3.5-Turbo. The prompts include a tutor role description and examples of
meaningful answers through few-shot learning. Iris employs contextual awareness
by accessing the problem statement, student code, and automated feedback to
provide tailored advice.
  An empirical evaluation shows that students perceive Iris as effective
because it understands their questions, provides relevant support, and
contributes to the learning process. While students consider Iris a valuable
tool for programming exercises and homework, they also feel confident solving
programming tasks in computer-based exams without Iris. The findings underscore
students' appreciation for Iris' immediate and personalized support, though
students predominantly view it as a complement to, rather than a replacement
for, human tutors. Nevertheless, Iris creates a space for students to ask
questions without being judged by others.

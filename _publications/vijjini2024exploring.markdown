As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily applications it is essential to ensure they operate fairly across diverse user demographics. In this work we show that LLMs suffer from personalization bias where their performance is impacted when they are personalized to a users identity. We quantify personalization bias by evaluating the performance of LLMs along two axes - safety and utility. We measure safety by examining how benign LLM responses are to unsafe prompts with and without personalization. We measure utility by evaluating the LLMs performance on various tasks including general knowledge mathematical abilities programming and reasoning skills. We find that various LLMs ranging from open-source models like Llama (Touvron et al. 2023) and Mistral (Jiang et al. 2023) to API-based ones like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o (Ouyang et al. 2022) exhibit significant variance in performance in terms of safety-utility trade-offs depending on the users identity. Finally we discuss several strategies to mitigate personalization bias using preference tuning and prompt-based defenses.

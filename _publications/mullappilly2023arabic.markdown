Climate change is one of the most significant challenges we face together as a society. Creating awareness and educating policy makers the wide45;ranging impact of climate change is an essential step towards a sustainable future. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Bard have shown impressive conversational abilities and excel in a wide variety of NLP tasks. While these models are close45;source recently alternative open45;source LLMs such as Stanford Alpaca and Vicuna have shown promising results. However these open45;source models are not specifically tailored for climate related domain specific information and also struggle to generate meaningful responses in other languages such as Arabic. To this end we propose a light45;weight Arabic Mini45;ClimateGPT that is built on an open45;source LLM and is specifically fine45;tuned on a conversational45;style instruction tuning curated Arabic dataset Clima50045;Instruct with over 500k instructions about climate change and sustainability. Further our model also utilizes a vector embedding based retrieval mechanism during inference. We validate our proposed model through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on climate45;related queries. Our model surpasses the baseline LLM in 88.337; of cases during ChatGPT45;based evaluation. Furthermore our human expert evaluation reveals an 81.637; preference for our models responses over multiple popular open45;source models. Our open45;source demos code45;base and models are available here https://github.com/mbzuai&#45;oryx/ClimateGPT.

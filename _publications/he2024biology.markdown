Large language models have already demonstrated their formidable capabilities
in general domains, ushering in a revolutionary transformation. However,
exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend
multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first
introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological
sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and
multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models
(LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance
the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based
prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining
conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance
limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related
multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We
further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel
three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand
biology by using Biology-Instructions. Biology-Instructions and ChatMultiOmics
are publicly available and crucial resources for enabling more effective
integration of LLMs with multi-omics sequence analysis.

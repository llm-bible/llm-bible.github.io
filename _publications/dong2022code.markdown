Story generation and understanding 45;45; as with all NLG/NLU tasks 45;45; has seen a surge in neurosymbolic work. Researchers have recognized that while large language models (LLMs) have tremendous utility they can be augmented with symbolic means to be even better and to make up for any flaws that the neural networks might have. However symbolic methods are extremely costly in terms of the amount of time and expertise needed to create them. In this work we capitalize on state45;of45;the45;art Code45;LLMs such as Codex to bootstrap the use of symbolic methods for tracking the state of stories and aiding in story understanding. We show that our CoRRPUS system and abstracted prompting procedures can beat current state45;of45;the45;art structured LLM techniques on pre45;existing story understanding tasks (bAbI Task 2 and Re^3) with minimal hand engineering. We hope that this work can help highlight the importance of symbolic representations and specialized prompting for LLMs as these models require some guidance for performing reasoning tasks properly.

The exponential growth of text-based data in domains such as healthcare,
education, and social sciences has outpaced the capacity of traditional
qualitative analysis methods, which are time-intensive and prone to
subjectivity. Large Language Models (LLMs), powered by advanced generative AI,
have emerged as transformative tools capable of automating and enhancing
qualitative analysis. This study systematically maps the literature on the use
of LLMs for qualitative research, exploring their application contexts,
configurations, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. Findings reveal that
LLMs are utilized across diverse fields, demonstrating the potential to
automate processes traditionally requiring extensive human input. However,
challenges such as reliance on prompt engineering, occasional inaccuracies, and
contextual limitations remain significant barriers. This research highlights
opportunities for integrating LLMs with human expertise, improving model
robustness, and refining evaluation methodologies. By synthesizing trends and
identifying research gaps, this study aims to guide future innovations in the
application of LLMs for qualitative analysis.

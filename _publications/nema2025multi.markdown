Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to their popularity
across multiple use-cases. However, prompt engineering, the process for
optimally utilizing such models, remains approximation-driven and subjective.
Most of the current research on prompt engineering focuses on task-specific
optimization, while neglecting the behavior of the LLM under consideration
during prompt development. This paper introduces MODP -- Multi Objective
Directional Prompting, a framework based on two key concepts: 1)
multi-objectivity: the importance of considering an LLM's intrinsic behavior as
an additional objective in prompt development, and 2) directional prompting: a
metrics-driven method for prompt engineering to ensure development of robust
and high-precision prompts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
ideas on a summarization task, using a synthetically created dataset, achieving
a 26% performance gain over initial prompts. Finally, we apply MODP to develop
prompts for Dell's Next Best Action support tool, which is now in production
and is used by more than 10,000 internal support agents and serving millions of
customers worldwide.

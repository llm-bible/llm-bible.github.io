In this paper we explore the alignment of values in Large Language Models (LLMs) with specific age groups leveraging data from the World Value Survey across thirteen categories. Through a diverse set of prompts tailored to ensure response robustness we find a general inclination of LLM values towards younger demographics. Additionally we explore the impact of incorporating age identity information in prompts and observe challenges in mitigating value discrepancies with different age cohorts. Our findings highlight the age bias in LLMs and provide insights for future work.

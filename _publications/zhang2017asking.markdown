Despite significant progress in a variety of vision-and-language problems,
developing a method capable of asking intelligent, goal-oriented questions
about images is proven to be an inscrutable challenge. Towards this end, we
propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework based on three new intermediate
rewards, namely goal-achieved, progressive and informativeness that encourage
the generation of succinct questions, which in turn uncover valuable
information towards the overall goal. By directly optimizing for questions that
work quickly towards fulfilling the overall goal, we avoid the tendency of
existing methods to generate long series of insane queries that add little
value. We evaluate our model on the GuessWhat?! dataset and show that the
resulting questions can help a standard Guesser identify a specific object in
an image at a much higher success rate.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI
assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current
state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high
operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To
address these issues, we propose the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an
innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with
dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures
task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced
through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts.
Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost
models to solve complex tasks effectively. For example, KGoT achieves a 29%
improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging
Face Agents with GPT-4o mini, while reducing costs by over 36x compared to
GPT-4o. Improvements for recent reasoning models are similar, e.g., 36% and
37.5% for Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B, respectively. KGoT offers a
scalable, affordable, and high-performing solution for AI assistants.

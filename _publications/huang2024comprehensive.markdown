Since the inception of the Transformer architecture in 2017, Large Language
Models (LLMs) such as GPT and BERT have evolved significantly, impacting
various industries with their advanced capabilities in language understanding
and generation. These models have shown potential to transform the medical
field, highlighting the necessity for specialized evaluation frameworks to
ensure their effective and ethical deployment. This comprehensive survey
delineates the extensive application and requisite evaluation of LLMs within
healthcare, emphasizing the critical need for empirical validation to fully
exploit their capabilities in enhancing healthcare outcomes. Our survey is
structured to provide an in-depth analysis of LLM applications across clinical
settings, medical text data processing, research, education, and public health
awareness. We begin by exploring the roles of LLMs in various medical
applications, detailing their evaluation based on performance in tasks such as
clinical diagnosis, medical text data processing, information retrieval, data
analysis, and educational content generation. The subsequent sections offer a
comprehensive discussion on the evaluation methods and metrics employed,
including models, evaluators, and comparative experiments. We further examine
the benchmarks and datasets utilized in these evaluations, providing a
categorized description of benchmarks for tasks like question answering,
summarization, information extraction, bioinformatics, information retrieval
and general comprehensive benchmarks. This structure ensures a thorough
understanding of how LLMs are assessed for their effectiveness, accuracy,
usability, and ethical alignment in the medical domain. ...

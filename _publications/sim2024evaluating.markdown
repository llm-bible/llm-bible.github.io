Understanding spatial relations is a crucial cognitive ability for both
humans and AI. While current research has predominantly focused on the
benchmarking of text-to-image (T2I) models, we propose a more comprehensive
evaluation that includes \textit\{both\} T2I and Large Language Models (LLMs). As
spatial relations are naturally understood in a visuo-spatial manner, we
develop an approach to convert LLM outputs into an image, thereby allowing us
to evaluate both T2I models and LLMs \textit\{visually\}. We examined the spatial
relation understanding of 8 prominent generative models (3 T2I models and 5
LLMs) on a set of 10 common prepositions, as well as assess the feasibility of
automatic evaluation methods. Surprisingly, we found that T2I models only
achieve subpar performance despite their impressive general image-generation
abilities. Even more surprisingly, our results show that LLMs are significantly
more accurate than T2I models in generating spatial relations, despite being
primarily trained on textual data. We examined reasons for model failures and
highlight gaps that can be filled to enable more spatially faithful
generations.

Prompt engineering can significantly improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs), with automated prompt optimization (APO) gaining
significant attention due to the time-consuming and laborious nature of manual
prompt design. However, much of the existing work in APO overlooks
task-specific characteristics, resulting in prompts that lack domain
specificity and are not well-suited for task-specific optimization. In this
paper, we introduce TAPO, a multitask-aware prompt optimization framework
composed of three key modules. First, a task-aware metric selection module is
proposed to enhance task-specific prompt generation capabilities. Second, we
present a multi-metrics evaluation module to jointly evaluate prompts from
multiple perspectives. Third, an evolution-based optimization framework is
introduced for automatic prompt refinement, which improves adaptability across
various tasks. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, and our code is publicly available.

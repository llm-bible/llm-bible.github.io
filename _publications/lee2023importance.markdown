Recent advances have greatly increased the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), but our understanding of the models and their safety has not
progressed as fast. In this paper we aim to understand LLMs deeper by studying
their individual neurons. We build upon previous work showing large language
models such as GPT-4 can be useful in explaining what each neuron in a language
model does. Specifically, we analyze the effect of the prompt used to generate
explanations and show that reformatting the explanation prompt in a more
natural way can significantly improve neuron explanation quality and greatly
reduce computational cost. We demonstrate the effects of our new prompts in
three different ways, incorporating both automated and human evaluations.

The purpose of this paper is to examine whether large language models (LLMs)
can understand what is good and evil with respect to judging good/evil
reputation of celebrities. Specifically, we first apply a large language model
(namely, ChatGPT) to the task of collecting sentences that mention the target
celebrity from articles about celebrities on Web pages. Next, the collected
sentences are categorized based on their contents by ChatGPT, where ChatGPT
assigns a category name to each of those categories. Those assigned category
names are referred to as "aspects" of each celebrity. Then, by applying the
framework of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), we show that the large
language model is quite effective in the task of judging good/evil reputation
of aspects and descriptions of each celebrity. Finally, also in terms of
proving the advantages of the proposed method over existing services
incorporating RAG functions, we show that the proposed method of judging
good/evil of aspects/descriptions of each celebrity significantly outperform an
existing service incorporating RAG functions.

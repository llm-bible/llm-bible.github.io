As large language models (LLMs) continue to evolve, the need for robust and
standardized evaluation benchmarks becomes paramount. Evaluating the
performance of these models is a complex challenge that requires careful
consideration of various linguistic tasks, model architectures, and
benchmarking methodologies. In recent years, various frameworks have emerged as
noteworthy contributions to the field, offering comprehensive evaluation tests
and benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of LLMs across diverse domains.
This paper provides an exploration and critical analysis of some of these
evaluation methodologies, shedding light on their strengths, limitations, and
impact on advancing the state-of-the-art in natural language processing.

In this review paper, we delve into the realm of Large Language Models
(LLMs), covering their foundational principles, diverse applications, and
nuanced training processes. The article sheds light on the mechanics of
in-context learning and a spectrum of fine-tuning approaches, with a special
focus on methods that optimize efficiency in parameter usage. Additionally, it
explores how LLMs can be more closely aligned with human preferences through
innovative reinforcement learning frameworks and other novel methods that
incorporate human feedback. The article also examines the emerging technique of
retrieval augmented generation, integrating external knowledge into LLMs. The
ethical dimensions of LLM deployment are discussed, underscoring the need for
mindful and responsible application. Concluding with a perspective on future
research trajectories, this review offers a succinct yet comprehensive overview
of the current state and emerging trends in the evolving landscape of LLMs,
serving as an insightful guide for both researchers and practitioners in
artificial intelligence.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot and few-shot capabilities in unseen tasks including context-grounded question answering (QA) in English. However the evaluation of LLMs capabilities in non-English languages for context-based QA is limited by the scarcity of benchmarks in non-English languages. To address this gap we introduce Indic-QA the largest publicly available context-grounded question-answering dataset for 11 major Indian languages from two language families. The dataset comprises both extractive and abstractive question-answering tasks and includes existing datasets as well as English QA datasets translated into Indian languages. Additionally we generate a synthetic dataset using the Gemini model to create question-answer pairs given a passage which is then manually verified for quality assurance. We evaluate various multilingual Large Language Models and their instruction-fine-tuned variants on the benchmark and observe that their performance is subpar particularly for low-resource languages. We hope that the release of this dataset will stimulate further research on the question-answering abilities of LLMs for low-resource languages.

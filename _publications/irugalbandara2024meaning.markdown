Extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to advanced applications requires
reliable structured output generation. Existing methods which often rely on
rigid JSON schemas, can lead to unreliable outputs, diminished reasoning
capabilities, and increased computational overhead, limiting LLMs' adaptability
for complex tasks. We introduce Meaning Typed Prompting (MTP), a technique for
efficient structured output generation that integrates types, meanings, and
abstractions, such as variables and classes, into the prompting process. By
utilizing expressive type definitions, MTP enhances output clarity and reduces
dependence on complex abstractions, simplifying development, and improving
implementation efficiency. This enables LLMs to understand relationships and
generate structured data more effectively. Empirical evaluations on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that MTP outperforms existing frameworks in accuracy,
reliability, consistency, and token efficiency. We present Semantix, a
framework that implements MTP, providing practical insights into its
application.

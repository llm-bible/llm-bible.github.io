In this work, we conduct an experiment using state-of-the-art LLMs to
translate MiniF2F into Rocq. The translation task focuses on generating a Rocq
theorem based on three sources: a natural language description, the Lean
formalization, and the Isabelle formalization. We conducted our experiment in 3
stages of increasing complexity, from basic one-shot prompting to multi-turn
conversations that incorporate feedback from unsuccessful attempts. At each
stage, we perform multiple rounds of translation using increasingly advanced
models: GPT-4o mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, o1 mini, and o1. We successfully
translated 478 out of 488 theorems. The dataset is opensource:

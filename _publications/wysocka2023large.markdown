The paper introduces a framework for the evaluation of the encoding of
factual scientific knowledge, designed to streamline the manual evaluation
process typically conducted by domain experts. Inferring over and extracting
information from Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on a large corpus of
scientific literature can potentially define a step change in biomedical
discovery, reducing the barriers for accessing and integrating existing medical
evidence. This work explores the potential of LLMs for dialoguing with
biomedical background knowledge, using the context of antibiotic discovery. The
framework involves of three evaluation steps, each assessing different aspects
sequentially: fluency, prompt alignment, semantic coherence, factual knowledge,
and specificity of the generated responses. By splitting these tasks between
non-experts and experts, the framework reduces the effort required from the
latter. The work provides a systematic assessment on the ability of eleven
state-of-the-art models LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Llama 2, in two
prompting-based tasks: chemical compound definition generation and chemical
compound-fungus relation determination. Although recent models have improved in
fluency, factual accuracy is still low and models are biased towards
over-represented entities. The ability of LLMs to serve as biomedical knowledge
bases is questioned, and the need for additional systematic evaluation
frameworks is highlighted. While LLMs are currently not fit for purpose to be
used as biomedical factual knowledge bases in a zero-shot setting, there is a
promising emerging property in the direction of factuality as the models become
domain specialised, scale-up in size and level of human feedback.

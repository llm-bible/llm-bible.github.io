Task45;Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems are drawing more and more attention in recent studies. Current methods focus on constructing pre45;trained models or fine45;tuning strategies while the evaluation of TOD is limited by a policy mismatch problem. That is during evaluation the user utterances are from the annotated dataset while these utterances should interact with previous responses which can have many alternatives besides annotated texts. Therefore in this work we propose an interactive evaluation framework for TOD. We first build a goal45;oriented user simulator based on pre45;trained models and then use the user simulator to interact with the dialogue system to generate dialogues. Besides we introduce a sentence45;level and a session45;level score to measure the sentence fluency and session coherence in the interactive evaluation. Experimental results show that RL45;based TOD systems trained by our proposed user simulator can achieve nearly 9837; inform and success rates in the interactive evaluation of MultiWOZ dataset and the proposed scores measure the response quality besides the inform and success rates. We are hoping that our work will encourage simulator45;based interactive evaluations in the TOD task.

This research introduces a novel text generation model that combines BERT's
semantic interpretation strengths with GPT-4's generative capabilities,
establishing a high standard in generating coherent, contextually accurate
language. Through the combined architecture, the model enhances semantic depth
and maintains smooth, human-like text flow, overcoming limitations seen in
prior models. Experimental benchmarks reveal that BERT-GPT-4 surpasses
traditional models, including GPT-3, T5, BART, Transformer-XL, and CTRL, in key
metrics like Perplexity and BLEU, showcasing its superior natural language
generation performance. By fully utilizing contextual information, this hybrid
model generates text that is not only logically coherent but also aligns
closely with human language patterns, providing an advanced solution for text
generation tasks. This research highlights the potential of integrating
semantic understanding with advanced generative models, contributing new
insights for NLP, and setting a foundation for broader applications of
large-scale generative architectures in areas such as automated writing,
question-answer systems, and adaptive conversational agents.

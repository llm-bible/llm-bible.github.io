Computer Science and Design practitioners have been researching and proposing
alternatives for a dearth of recommendations, standards, or best practices in
user interfaces for decades. Now, with the advent of generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI), we have yet again an emerging, powerful technology that
lacks sufficient guidance in terms of possible interactions, inputs, and
outcomes. In this context, this work proposes a lightweight framework for
responsible prompting recommendation to be added before the prompt is sent to
GenAI. The framework is comprised of (1) a human-curated dataset for
recommendations, (2) a red team dataset for assessing recommendations, (3) a
sentence transformer for semantics mapping, (4) a similarity metric to map
input prompt to recommendations, (5) a set of similarity thresholds, (6)
quantized sentence embeddings, (7) a recommendation engine, and (8) an
evaluation step to use the red team dataset. With the proposed framework and
open-source system, the contributions presented can be applied in multiple
contexts where end-users can benefit from guidance for interacting with GenAI
in a more responsible way, recommending positive values to be added and harmful
sentences to be removed.

In previous studies, code-based models have consistently outperformed
text-based models in reasoning-intensive scenarios. When generating our
knowledge base for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we observed that
code-based models also perform exceptionally well in Chinese QA Pair Extraction
task. Further, our experiments and the metrics we designed discovered that
code-based models containing a certain amount of Chinese data achieve even
better performance. Additionally, the capabilities of code-based English models
in specified Chinese tasks offer a distinct perspective for discussion on the
philosophical "Chinese Room" thought experiment.

Multi-hop QA (MHQA) involves step-by-step reasoning to answer complex questions and find multiple relevant supporting facts. However Existing large language models(LLMs) reasoning ability in multi-hop question answering remains exploration which is inadequate in answering multi-hop questions. Moreover it is unclear whether LLMs follow a desired reasoning chain to reach the right final answer. In this paper we propose a erative question omposition method (GenDec) from the perspective of explainable QA by generating independent and complete sub-questions based on incorporating additional extracted evidence for enhancing LLMs reasoning ability in RAG. To demonstrate the impact generalization and robustness of Gendec we conduct two experiments the first is combining GenDec with small QA systems on paragraph retrieval and QA tasks. We secondly examine the reasoning capabilities of various state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 combined with GenDec. We experiment on the HotpotQA 2WikihopMultiHopQA MuSiQue and PokeMQA datasets.

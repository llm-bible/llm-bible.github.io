Instructions45;tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) gained recently huge popularity thanks to their ability to interact with users through conversation. In this work we aim to evaluate their ability to complete multi45;turn tasks and interact with external databases in the context of established task45;oriented dialogue benchmarks. We show that for explicit belief state tracking LLMs underperform compared to specialized task45;specific models. Nevertheless they show ability to guide the dialogue to successful ending if given correct slot values. Furthermore this ability improves with access to true belief state distribution or in45;domain examples.

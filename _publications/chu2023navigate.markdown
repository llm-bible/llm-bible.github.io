Reasoning, a fundamental cognitive process integral to human intelligence,
has garnered substantial interest within artificial intelligence. Notably,
recent studies have revealed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly
enhances LLM's reasoning capabilities, which attracts widespread attention from
both academics and industry. In this paper, we systematically investigate
relevant research, summarizing advanced methods through a meticulous taxonomy
that offers novel perspectives. Moreover, we delve into the current frontiers
and delineate the challenges and future directions, thereby shedding light on
future research. Furthermore, we engage in a discussion about open questions.
We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future
research. Resources have been made publicly available at

Reasoning a fundamental cognitive process integral to human intelligence has garnered substantial interest within artificial intelligence. Notably recent studies have revealed that chain-of-thought prompting significantly enhances LLMs reasoning capabilities which attracts widespread attention from both academics and industry. In this paper we systematically investigate relevant research summarizing advanced methods through a meticulous taxonomy that offers novel perspectives. Moreover we delve into the current frontiers and delineate the challenges and future directions thereby shedding light on future research. Furthermore we engage in a discussion about open questions. We hope this paper serves as an introduction for beginners and fosters future research. Resources have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zchuz/CoT-Reasoning-Survey"

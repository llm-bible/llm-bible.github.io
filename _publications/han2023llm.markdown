In the context of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) writing education,
LLM-as-a-tutor can assist students by providing real-time feedback on their
essays. However, challenges arise in assessing LLM-as-a-tutor due to differing
standards between educational and general use cases. To bridge this gap, we
integrate pedagogical principles to assess student-LLM interaction. First, we
explore how LLMs can function as English tutors, providing effective essay
feedback tailored to students. Second, we propose three metrics to evaluate
LLM-as-a-tutor specifically designed for EFL writing education, emphasizing
pedagogical aspects. In this process, EFL experts evaluate the feedback from
LLM-as-a-tutor regarding quality and characteristics. On the other hand, EFL
learners assess their learning outcomes from interaction with LLM-as-a-tutor.
This approach lays the groundwork for developing LLMs-as-a-tutor tailored to
the needs of EFL learners, advancing the effectiveness of writing education in
this context.

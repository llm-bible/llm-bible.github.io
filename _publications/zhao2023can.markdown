Although large conversational AI models such as OpenAIs ChatGPT have demonstrated great potential we question whether such models can guarantee factual accuracy. Recently technology companies such as Microsoft and Google have announced new services which aim to combine search engines with conversational AI. However we have found numerous mistakes in the public demonstrations that suggest we should not easily trust the factual claims of the AI models. Rather than criticizing specific models or companies we hope to call on researchers and developers to improve AI models transparency and factual correctness.

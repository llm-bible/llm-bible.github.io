The use of question-based activities (QBAs) is wide-spread in education traditionally forming an integral part of the learning and assessment process. In this paper we design and evaluate an automated question generation tool for formative and summative assessment in schools. We present an expert survey of one hundred and four teachers demonstrating the need for automated generation of QBAs as a tool that can significantly reduce the workload of teachers and facilitate personalized learning experiences. Leveraging the recent advancements in generative AI we then present a modular framework employing transformer based language models for automatic generation of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from textual content. The presented solution with distinct modules for question generation correct answer prediction and distractor formulation enables us to evaluate different language models and generation techniques. Finally we perform an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrating trade-offs in the use of different techniques and models.

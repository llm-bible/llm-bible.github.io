Effective communication within universities is crucial for addressing the
diverse information needs of students, alumni, and external stakeholders.
However, existing chatbot systems often fail to deliver accurate,
context-specific responses, resulting in poor user experiences. In this paper,
we present KatzBot, an innovative chatbot powered by KatzGPT, a custom Large
Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on domain-specific academic data. KatzGPT is
trained on two university-specific datasets: 6,280 sentence-completion pairs
and 7,330 question-answer pairs. KatzBot outperforms established existing open
source LLMs, achieving higher accuracy and domain relevance. KatzBot offers a
user-friendly interface, significantly enhancing user satisfaction in
real-world applications. The source code is publicly available at

Storytelling plays a central role in human socializing and entertainment.
However, much of the research on automatic storytelling generation assumes that
stories will be generated by an agent without any human interaction. In this
paper, we introduce the task of collaborative storytelling, where an artificial
intelligence agent and a person collaborate to create a unique story by taking
turns adding to it. We present a collaborative storytelling system which works
with a human storyteller to create a story by generating new utterances based
on the story so far. We constructed the storytelling system by tuning a
publicly-available large scale language model on a dataset of writing prompts
and their accompanying fictional works. We identify generating sufficiently
human-like utterances to be an important technical issue and propose a
sample-and-rank approach to improve utterance quality. Quantitative evaluation
shows that our approach outperforms a baseline, and we present qualitative
evaluation of our system's capabilities.

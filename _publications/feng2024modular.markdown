While existing alignment paradigms have been integral in developing large language models (LLMs) LLMs often learn an averaged human preference and struggle to model diverse preferences across cultures demographics and communities. We propose Modular Pluralism a modular framework based on multi45;LLM collaboration for pluralistic alignment it plugs into a base LLM a pool of smaller but specialized community LMs where models collaborate in distinct modes to flexibility support three modes of pluralism Overton steerable and distributional. Modular Pluralism is uniquely compatible with black45;box LLMs and offers the modular control of adding new community LMs for previously underrepresented communities. We evaluate Modular Pluralism with six tasks and four datasets featuring questions/instructions with value45;laden and perspective45;informed responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Modular Pluralism advances the three pluralism objectives across six black45;box and open45;source LLMs. Further analysis reveals that LLMs are generally faithful to the inputs from smaller community LLMs allowing seamless patching by adding a new community LM to better cover previously underrepresented communities.

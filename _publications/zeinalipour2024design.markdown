Pre45;trained LLMs have demonstrated substantial capabilities across a range of conventional natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as summarization and entity recognition. In this paper we explore the application of LLMs in the generation of high45;quality protein sequences. Specifically we adopt a suite of pre45;trained LLMs including Mistral45;7B1 Llama45;245;7B2 Llama45;345;8B3 and gemma45;7B4 to produce valid protein sequences. All of these models are publicly available.5 Unlike previous work in this field our approach utilizes a relatively small dataset comprising 42000 distinct human protein sequences. We retrain these models to process protein45;related data ensuring the generation of biologically feasible protein structures. Our findings demonstrate that even with limited data the adapted models exhibit efficiency comparable to established protein45;focused models such as ProGen varieties ProtGPT2 and ProLLaMA which were trained on millions of protein sequences. To validate and quantify the performance of our models we conduct comparative analyses employing standard metrics such as pLDDT RMSD TM45;score and REU. Furthermore we commit to making the trained versions of all four models publicly available fostering greater transparency and collaboration in the field of computational biology.

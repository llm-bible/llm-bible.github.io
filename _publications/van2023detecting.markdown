Recently large language models (LLMs) have taken the spotlight in natural language processing. Further integrating LLMs with vision enables the users to explore more emergent abilities in multimodality. Visual language models (VLMs) such as LLaVA Flamingo or GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive performance on various visio-linguistic tasks. Consequently there are enormous applications of large models that could be potentially used on social media platforms. Despite that there is a lack of related work on detecting or correcting hateful memes with VLMs. In this work we study the ability of VLMs on hateful meme detection and hateful meme correction tasks with zero-shot prompting. From our empirical experiments we show the effectiveness of the pretrained LLaVA model and discuss its strengths and weaknesses in these tasks.

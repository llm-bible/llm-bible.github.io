Grammatical error correction (GEC) aims to correct grammatical, spelling, and
semantic errors in natural language text. With the growing of large language
models (LLMs), direct text generation has gradually become the focus of the GEC
methods, and few-shot in-context learning presents a cost-effective solution.
However, selecting effective in-context examples remains challenging, as the
similarity between input texts does not necessarily correspond to similar
grammatical error patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel retrieval method
based on natural language grammatical error explanations (GEE) to address this
issue. Our method retrieves suitable few-shot demonstrations by matching the
GEE of the test input with that of pre-constructed database samples, where
explanations for erroneous samples are generated by LLMs. We conducted
multilingual GEC few-shot experiments on both major open-source and
closed-source LLMs. Experiments across five languages show that our method
outperforms existing semantic and BM25-based retrieval techniques, without
requiring additional training or language adaptation. This also suggests that
matching error patterns is key to selecting examples.

Adversarial examples are inputs to machine learning models designed to cause
the model to make a mistake. They are useful for understanding the shortcomings
of machine learning models, interpreting their results, and for regularisation.
In NLP, however, most example generation strategies produce input text by using
known, pre-specified semantic transformations, requiring significant manual
effort and in-depth understanding of the problem and domain. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of automatically generating adversarial examples that
violate a set of given First-Order Logic constraints in Natural Language
Inference (NLI). We reduce the problem of identifying such adversarial examples
to a combinatorial optimisation problem, by maximising a quantity measuring the
degree of violation of such constraints and by using a language model for
generating linguistically-plausible examples. Furthermore, we propose a method
for adversarially regularising neural NLI models for incorporating background
knowledge. Our results show that, while the proposed method does not always
improve results on the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets, it significantly and
consistently increases the predictive accuracy on adversarially-crafted
datasets -- up to a 79.6% relative improvement -- while drastically reducing
the number of background knowledge violations. Furthermore, we show that
adversarial examples transfer among model architectures, and that the proposed
adversarial training procedure improves the robustness of NLI models to
adversarial examples.

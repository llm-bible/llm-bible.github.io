Recent advances in Large Language Models have led to remarkable achievements
across a variety of Natural Language Processing tasks, making prompt
engineering increasingly central to guiding model outputs. While manual methods
can be effective, they typically rely on intuition and do not automatically
refine prompts over time. In contrast, automatic prompt optimization employing
heuristic-based search algorithms can systematically explore and improve
prompts with minimal human oversight. This survey proposes a comprehensive
taxonomy of these methods, categorizing them by where optimization occurs, what
is optimized, what criteria drive the optimization, which operators generate
new prompts, and which iterative search algorithms are applied. We further
highlight specialized datasets and tools that support and accelerate automated
prompt refinement. We conclude by discussing key open challenges pointing
toward future opportunities for more robust and versatile LLM applications.

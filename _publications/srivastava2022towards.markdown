We present very early results on using GPT45;3 to perform question answering on tabular data. We find that stock pre45;trained GPT45;3 is able to zero45;shot learn the table structure from a serialized JSON array45;of45;arrays representation and able to answer lookup queries and simple comparison questions in natural language without any fine45;tuning. We further find that simple prompt engineering to include few45;shot static Qamp;A examples significantly improves accuracy. Lastly we find that intermixing passage text improves accuracy even further on heterogeneous data. We apply our approach on a novel dataset of simple tables in newspaper infographics with promising results. Overall we find much cause for optimism in this basic approach.

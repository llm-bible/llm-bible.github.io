Empathetic response generation is a desirable aspect of conversational
agents, crucial for facilitating engaging and emotionally intelligent
multi-turn conversations between humans and machines. Leveraging large language
models for this task has shown promising results, yet challenges persist in
ensuring both the empathetic quality of the responses and retention of the
generalization performance of the models. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach where we construct theory-driven preference datasets and use them to
align LLMs with preference optimization algorithms to address these challenges.
To measure empathetic response generation, we employ the EmpatheticDialogues
dataset, assessing empathy with the diff-EPITOME and BERTscore metrics, and
evaluate the generalization performance on the MMLU benchmark. We make all
datasets, source code, and models publicly available.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized open45;domain dialogue agents but encounter challenges in multi45;character role45;playing (MCRP) scenarios. To address the issue we present Neeko an innovative framework designed for efficient multiple characters imitation. Unlike existing methods Neeko employs a dynamic low45;rank adapter (LoRA) strategy enabling it to adapt seamlessly to diverse characters. Our framework breaks down the role45;playing process into agent pre45;training multiple characters playing and character incremental learning effectively handling both seen and unseen roles. This dynamic approach coupled with distinct LoRA blocks for each character enhances Neekos adaptability to unique attributes personalities and speaking patterns. As a result Neeko demonstrates superior performance in MCRP over most existing methods offering more engaging and versatile user interaction experiences. Code and data are available at https://github.com/weiyifan1023/Neeko.

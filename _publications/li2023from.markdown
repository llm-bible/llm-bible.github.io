The remarkable ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand and follow instructions has sometimes been limited by their in45;context learning (ICL) performance in low45;resource languages. To address this we introduce a novel approach that leverages cross45;lingual retrieval45;augmented in45;context learning (CREA45;ICL). By extracting semantically similar prompts from high45;resource languages we aim to improve the zero45;shot performance of multilingual pre45;trained language models (MPLMs) across diverse tasks. Though our approach yields steady improvements in classification tasks it faces challenges in generation tasks. Our evaluation offers insights into the performance dynamics of retrieval45;augmented in45;context learning across both classification and generation domains.

An empirical investigation into the simulation of the Big Five personality
traits by large language models (LLMs), namely Llama2, GPT4, and Mixtral, is
presented. We analyze the personality traits simulated by these models and
their stability. This contributes to the broader understanding of the
capabilities of LLMs to simulate personality traits and the respective
implications for personalized human-computer interaction.

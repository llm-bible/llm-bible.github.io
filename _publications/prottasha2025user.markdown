User profile modeling plays a key role in personalized systems, as it
requires building accurate profiles and updating them with new information. In
this paper, we present two high-quality open-source user profile datasets: one
for profile construction and another for profile updating. These datasets offer
a strong basis for evaluating user profile modeling techniques in dynamic
settings. We also show a methodology that uses large language models (LLMs) to
tackle both profile construction and updating. Our method uses a probabilistic
framework to predict user profiles from input text, allowing for precise and
context-aware profile generation. Our experiments demonstrate that models like
Mistral-7b and Llama2-7b perform strongly in both tasks. LLMs improve the
precision and recall of the generated profiles, and high evaluation scores
confirm the effectiveness of our approach.

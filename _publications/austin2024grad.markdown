Prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) is often a manual time45;intensive process that involves generating evaluating and refining prompts iteratively to ensure high45;quality outputs. While there has been work on automating prompt engineering the solutions generally are either tuned to specific tasks with given answers or are quite costly. We introduce GRAD45;SUM a scalable and flexible method for automatic prompt engineering that builds on gradient45;based optimization techniques. Our approach incorporates user45;defined task descriptions and evaluation criteria and features a novel gradient summarization module to generalize feedback effectively. Our results demonstrate that GRAD45;SUM consistently outperforms existing methods across various benchmarks highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in automatic prompt optimization.

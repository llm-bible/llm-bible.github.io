In this work we present a comprehensive study of Meta Prompting (MP) an innovative technique reshaping the utilization of language models (LMs) and AI systems in problem45;solving and data interaction. Grounded in type theory and category theory Meta Prompting emphasizes the structure and syntax of information over traditional content45;centric methods. The paper explores the formal definitions of Meta Prompting sets it apart from few45;shot prompting and underlines its effectiveness in various AI applications. A key focus is applying Meta Prompting for complex reasoning tasks showing how it effectively deconstructs intricate problems into simpler sub45;problems enhancing token efficiency and enabling more equitable problem45;solving comparisons especially against few45;shot prompting methods. Additionally the paper introduces Meta Prompting for prompting tasks allowing LLMs to self45;generate new prompts in a recursive metaprogramming45;like manner. Empirical experiments including using a Qwen45;72B base language model equipped with meta prompt without instruction45;tuning to solve MATH problems with accuracy at 46.337; which surpass the supervised fine45;tuned counterpart trained with extensive mathematical QA instruction pairs and even the initial version of GPT45;4 solving GSM8K problems with 83.537; accuracy with zero45;shot meta45;prompted Qwen45;72B base language model and solving the Game of 24 tasks with a 10037; success rate using GPT45;4 demonstrate the meta promptings efficacy in achieving high accuracy and efficiency showcasing Meta Promptings transformative impact on AI problem45;solving The code is available at https://github.com/meta&#45;prompting/meta&#45;prompting.

Game development is a highly specialized task that relies on a complex game engine powered by complex programming languages preventing many gaming enthusiasts from handling it. This paper introduces the Interaction45;driven Game Engine (IGE) powered by LLM which allows everyone to develop a custom game using natural language through Human45;LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to function as an IGE we instruct it to perform the following processes in each turn (1) P95;123;script125; configure the game script segment based on the users input; (2) P95;123;code125; generate the corresponding code snippet based on the game script segment; (3) P95;123;utter125; interact with the user including guidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on the LLM to generate game script45;code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted seed data. We propose a three45;stage progressive training strategy to transfer the dialogue45;based LLM to our IGE smoothly. We construct an IGE for poker games as a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives interaction quality and code correctness. The code and data are available at url123;https://github.com/alterego238/IGE&#125;.

The BERT family of neural language models have become highly popular due to their ability to provide sequences of text with rich context45;sensitive token encodings which are able to generalise well to many NLP tasks. We introduce gaBERT a monolingual BERT model for the Irish language. We compare our gaBERT model to multilingual BERT and the monolingual Irish WikiBERT and we show that gaBERT provides better representations for a downstream parsing task. We also show how different filtering criteria vocabulary size and the choice of subword tokenisation model affect downstream performance. We compare the results of fine45;tuning a gaBERT model with an mBERT model for the task of identifying verbal multiword expressions and show that the fine45;tuned gaBERT model also performs better at this task. We release gaBERT and related code to the community.

Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to generate high-stakes documents,
such as informed consent forms (ICFs), remains a significant challenge due to
the extreme need for regulatory compliance and factual accuracy. Here, we
present InformGen, an LLM-driven copilot for accurate and compliant ICF
drafting by optimized knowledge document parsing and content generation, with
humans in the loop. We further construct a benchmark dataset comprising
protocols and ICFs from 900 clinical trials. Experimental results demonstrate
that InformGen achieves near 100% compliance with 18 core regulatory rules
derived from FDA guidelines, outperforming a vanilla GPT-4o model by up to 30%.
Additionally, a user study with five annotators shows that InformGen, when
integrated with manual intervention, attains over 90% factual accuracy,
significantly surpassing the vanilla GPT-4o model's 57%-82%. Crucially,
InformGen ensures traceability by providing inline citations to source
protocols, enabling easy verification and maintaining the highest standards of
factual integrity.

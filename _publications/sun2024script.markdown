Chatbots or conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used to improve
access to digital psychotherapy. Many current systems rely on rigid, rule-based
designs, heavily dependent on expert-crafted dialogue scripts for guiding
therapeutic conversations. Although recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) offer the potential for more flexible interactions, their lack of
controllability and transparency poses significant challenges in sensitive
areas like psychotherapy. In this work, we explored how aligning LLMs with
expert-crafted scripts can enhance psychotherapeutic chatbot performance. Our
comparative study showed that LLMs aligned with expert-crafted scripts through
prompting and fine-tuning significantly outperformed both pure LLMs and
rule-based chatbots, achieving a more effective balance between dialogue
flexibility and adherence to therapeutic principles. Building on findings, we
proposed ``Script-Strategy Aligned Generation (SSAG)'', a flexible alignment
approach that reduces reliance on fully scripted content while enhancing LLMs'
therapeutic adherence and controllability. In a 10-day field study, SSAG
demonstrated performance comparable to full script alignment and outperformed
rule-based chatbots, empirically supporting SSAG as an efficient approach for
aligning LLMs with domain expertise. Our work advances LLM applications in
psychotherapy by providing a controllable, adaptable, and scalable solution for
digital interventions, reducing reliance on expert effort. It also provides a
collaborative framework for domain experts and developers to efficiently build
expertise-aligned chatbots, broadening access to psychotherapy and behavioral
interventions.

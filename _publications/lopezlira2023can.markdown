We document the capability of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to
predict stock price movements using news headlines, even without direct
financial training. ChatGPT scores significantly predict out-of-sample daily
stock returns, subsuming traditional methods, and predictability is stronger
among smaller stocks and following negative news. To explain these findings, we
develop a theoretical model incorporating information capacity constraints,
underreaction, limits-to-arbitrage, and LLMs. The model generates several key
predictions, which we empirically test: (i) it establishes a critical threshold
in AI capabilities necessary for profitable predictions, (ii) it demonstrates
that only advanced LLMs can effectively interpret complex information, and
(iii) it predicts that widespread LLM adoption can enhance market efficiency.
Our results suggest that sophisticated return forecasting is an emerging
capability of AI systems and that these technologies can alter information
diffusion and decision-making processes in financial markets. Finally, we
introduce an interpretability framework to evaluate LLMs' reasoning,
contributing to AI transparency and economic decision-making.

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to understand the neural mechanisms that enable specific behaviors in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging causality45;based methods. While these approaches have identified neural circuits that copy spans of text capture factual knowledge and more they remain unusable for multimodal models since adapting these tools to the vision45;language domain requires considerable architectural changes. In this work we adapt a unimodal causal tracing tool to BLIP to enable the study of the neural mechanisms underlying image45;conditioned text generation. We demonstrate our approach on a visual question answering dataset highlighting the causal relevance of later layer representations for all tokens. Furthermore we release our BLIP causal tracing tool as open source to enable further experimentation in vision45;language mechanistic interpretability by the community. Our code is available at https://github.com/vedantpalit/Towards&#45;Vision&#45;Language&#45;Mechanistic&#45;Interpretability.

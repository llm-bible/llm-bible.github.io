Regulatory compliance in the pharmaceutical industry entails navigating through complex and voluminous guidelines often requiring significant human resources. To address these challenges our study introduces a chatbot model that utilizes generative AI and the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method. This chatbot is designed to search for guideline documents relevant to the user inquiries and provide answers based on the retrieved guidelines. Recognizing the inherent need for high reliability in this domain we propose the Question and Answer Retrieval Augmented Generation (QA-RAG) model. In comparative experiments the QA-RAG model demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy outperforming all other baselines including conventional RAG methods. This paper details QA-RAGs structure and performance evaluation emphasizing its potential for the regulatory compliance domain in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond. We have made our work publicly available for further research and development.

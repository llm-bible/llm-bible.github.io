The final frontier for simulation is the accurate representation of complex,
real-world social systems. While agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to study the
behavior and interactions of agents within a larger system, it is unable to
faithfully capture the full complexity of human-driven behavior. Large language
models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, have emerged as a potential solution to this
bottleneck by enabling researchers to explore human-driven interactions in
previously unimaginable ways. Our research investigates simulations of human
interactions using LLMs. Through prompt engineering, inspired by Park et al.
(2023), we present two simulations of believable proxies of human behavior: a
two-agent negotiation and a six-agent murder mystery game.

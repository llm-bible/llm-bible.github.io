In this work we consider Code World Models world models generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) in the form of Python code for model-based Reinforcement Learning (RL). Calling code instead of LLMs for planning has the advantages of being precise reliable interpretable and extremely efficient. However writing appropriate Code World Models requires the ability to understand complex instructions to generate exact code with non-trivial logic and to self-debug a long program with feedback from unit tests and environment trajectories. To address these challenges we propose Generate Improve and Fix with Monte Carlo Tree Search (GIF-MCTS) a new code generation strategy for LLMs. To test our approach we introduce the Code World Models Benchmark (CWMB) a suite of program synthesis and planning tasks comprised of 18 diverse RL environments paired with corresponding textual descriptions and curated trajectories. GIF-MCTS surpasses all baselines on the CWMB and two other benchmarks and we show that the Code World Models synthesized with it can be successfully used for planning resulting in model-based RL agents with greatly improved sample efficiency and inference speed.

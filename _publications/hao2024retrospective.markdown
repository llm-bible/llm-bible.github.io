In-basket message interactions play a crucial role in physician-patient
communication, occurring during all phases (pre-, during, and post) of a
patient's care journey. However, responding to these patients' inquiries has
become a significant burden on healthcare workflows, consuming considerable
time for clinical care teams. To address this, we introduce RadOnc-GPT, a
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) powered by GPT-4 that has been designed
with a focus on radiotherapeutic treatment of prostate cancer with advanced
prompt engineering, and specifically designed to assist in generating
responses. We integrated RadOnc-GPT with patient electronic health records
(EHR) from both the hospital-wide EHR database and an internal,
radiation-oncology-specific database. RadOnc-GPT was evaluated on 158
previously recorded in-basket message interactions. Quantitative natural
language processing (NLP) analysis and two grading studies with clinicians and
nurses were used to assess RadOnc-GPT's responses. Our findings indicate that
RadOnc-GPT slightly outperformed the clinical care team in "Clarity" and
"Empathy," while achieving comparable scores in "Completeness" and
"Correctness." RadOnc-GPT is estimated to save 5.2 minutes per message for
nurses and 2.4 minutes for clinicians, from reading the inquiry to sending the
response. Employing RadOnc-GPT for in-basket message draft generation has the
potential to alleviate the workload of clinical care teams and reduce
healthcare costs by producing high-quality, timely responses.

In this work, we benchmark various graph-based retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) systems across a broad spectrum of query types, including OLTP-style
(fact-based) and OLAP-style (thematic) queries, to address the complex demands
of open-domain question answering (QA). Traditional RAG methods often fall
short in handling nuanced, multi-document synthesis tasks. By structuring
knowledge as graphs, we can facilitate the retrieval of context that captures
greater semantic depth and enhances language model operations. We explore
graph-based RAG methodologies and introduce TREX, a novel, cost-effective
alternative that combines graph-based and vector-based retrieval techniques.
Our benchmarking across four diverse datasets highlights the strengths of
different RAG methodologies, demonstrates TREX's ability to handle multiple
open-domain QA types, and reveals the limitations of current evaluation
methods.
  In a real-world technical support case study, we demonstrate how TREX
solutions can surpass conventional vector-based RAG in efficiently synthesizing
data from heterogeneous sources. Our findings underscore the potential of
augmenting large language models with advanced retrieval and orchestration
capabilities, advancing scalable, graph-based AI solutions.

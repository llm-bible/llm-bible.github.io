E-learning environments are increasingly harnessing large language models
(LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for tailored educational support. This study
introduces an approach that integrates dynamic knowledge graphs with LLMs to
offer nuanced student assistance. By evaluating past and ongoing student
interactions, the system identifies and appends the most salient learning
context to prompts directed at the LLM. Central to this method is the knowledge
graph's role in assessing a student's comprehension of topic prerequisites.
Depending on the categorized understanding (good, average, or poor), the LLM
adjusts its guidance, offering advanced assistance, foundational reviews, or
in-depth prerequisite explanations, respectively. Preliminary findings suggest
students could benefit from this tiered support, achieving enhanced
comprehension and improved task outcomes. However, several issues related to
potential errors arising from LLMs were identified, which can potentially
mislead students. This highlights the need for human intervention to mitigate
these risks. This research aims to advance AI-driven personalized learning
while acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls, thus guiding future
research in technology and data-driven education.

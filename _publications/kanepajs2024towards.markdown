Linguistically inclusive LLMs -- which maintain good performance regardless
of the language with which they are prompted -- are necessary for the diffusion
of AI benefits around the world. Multilingual jailbreaks that rely on language
translation to evade safety measures undermine the safe and inclusive
deployment of AI systems. We provide policy recommendations to enhance the
multilingual capabilities of AI while mitigating the risks of multilingual
jailbreaks. We examine how a language's level of resourcing relates to how
vulnerable LLMs are to multilingual jailbreaks in that language. We do this by
testing five advanced AI models across 24 official languages of the EU.
Building on prior research, we propose policy actions that align with the EU
legal landscape and institutional framework to address multilingual jailbreaks,
while promoting linguistic inclusivity. These include mandatory assessments of
multilingual capabilities and vulnerabilities, public opinion research, and
state support for multilingual AI development. The measures aim to improve AI
safety and functionality through EU policy initiatives, guiding the
implementation of the EU AI Act and informing regulatory efforts of the
European AI Office.

Large language models (LLMs) have made tremendous progress in natural language understanding and they have also been successfully adopted in other domains such as computer vision robotics reinforcement learning etc. In this work we apply LLMs to image generation tasks by directly generating the virtual brush strokes to paint an image. We present Painter an LLM that can convert user prompts in text description format to sketches by generating the corresponding brush strokes in an auto-regressive way. We construct Painter based on off-the-shelf LLM that is pre-trained on a large text corpus by fine-tuning it on the new task while preserving language understanding capabilities. We create a dataset of diverse multi-object sketches paired with textual prompts that covers several object types and tasks. Painter can generate sketches from text descriptions remove objects from canvas and detect and classify objects in sketches. Although this is an unprecedented pioneering work in using LLMs for auto-regressive image generation the results are very encouraging.

This work presents a novel architecture for context-aware interactions within
smart environments, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance user
experiences. Our system integrates user location data obtained through UWB tags
and sensor-equipped smart homes with real-time human activity recognition (HAR)
to provide a comprehensive understanding of user context. This contextual
information is then fed to an LLM-powered chatbot, enabling it to generate
personalised interactions and recommendations based on the user's current
activity and environment. This approach moves beyond traditional static chatbot
interactions by dynamically adapting to the user's real-time situation. A case
study conducted from a real-world dataset demonstrates the feasibility and
effectiveness of our proposed architecture, showcasing its potential to create
more intuitive and helpful interactions within smart homes. The results
highlight the significant benefits of integrating LLM with real-time activity
and location data to deliver personalised and contextually relevant user
experiences.

In light of the dynamic nature of autonomous driving environments and
stringent safety requirements, general MLLMs combined with CLIP alone often
struggle to represent driving-specific scenarios accurately, particularly in
complex interactions and long-tail cases. To address this, we propose the Hints
of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity
hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise
connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to
driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic
signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context,
focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint
Fusion module, enriching visual representations and enhancing multimodal
reasoning for autonomous driving VQA tasks. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing it significantly outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods across all key metrics.

Our work involves enriching the Stack-LSTM transition-based AMR parser
(Ballesteros and Al-Onaizan, 2017) by augmenting training with Policy Learning
and rewarding the Smatch score of sampled graphs. In addition, we also combined
several AMR-to-text alignments with an attention mechanism and we supplemented
the parser with pre-processed concept identification, named entities and
contextualized embeddings. We achieve a highly competitive performance that is
comparable to the best published results. We show an in-depth study ablating
each of the new components of the parser

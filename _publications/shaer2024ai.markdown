The growing availability of generative AI technologies such as large language
models (LLMs) has significant implications for creative work. This paper
explores twofold aspects of integrating LLMs into the creative process - the
divergence stage of idea generation, and the convergence stage of evaluation
and selection of ideas. We devised a collaborative group-AI Brainwriting
ideation framework, which incorporated an LLM as an enhancement into the group
ideation process, and evaluated the idea generation process and the resulted
solution space. To assess the potential of using LLMs in the idea evaluation
process, we design an evaluation engine and compared it to idea ratings
assigned by three expert and six novice evaluators. Our findings suggest that
integrating LLM in Brainwriting could enhance both the ideation process and its
outcome. We also provide evidence that LLMs can support idea evaluation. We
conclude by discussing implications for HCI education and practice.

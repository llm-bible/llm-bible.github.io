This work delves into the expanding role of large language models (LLMs) in
generating artificial data. LLMs are increasingly employed to create a variety
of outputs, including annotations, preferences, instruction prompts, simulated
dialogues, and free text. As these forms of LLM-generated data often intersect
in their application, they exert mutual influence on each other and raise
significant concerns about the quality and diversity of the artificial data
incorporated into training cycles, leading to an artificial data ecosystem. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to aggregate various types
of LLM-generated text data, from more tightly constrained data like "task
labels" to more lightly constrained "free-form text". We then stress test the
quality and implications of LLM-generated artificial data, comparing it with
human data across various existing benchmarks. Despite artificial data's
capability to match human performance, this paper reveals significant hidden
disparities, especially in complex tasks where LLMs often miss the nuanced
understanding of intrinsic human-generated content. This study critically
examines diverse LLM-generated data and emphasizes the need for ethical
practices in data creation and when using LLMs. It highlights the LLMs'
shortcomings in replicating human traits and behaviors, underscoring the
importance of addressing biases and artifacts produced in LLM-generated content
for future research and development. All data and code are available on our
project page.

Visual Question Answering with Natural Language Explanation (VQA45;NLE) task is challenging due to its high demand for reasoning45;based inference. Recent VQA45;NLE studies focus on enhancing model networks to amplify the models reasoning capability but this approach is resource45;consuming and unstable. In this work we introduce a new VQA45;NLE model ReRe (Retrieval45;augmented natural language Reasoning) using leverage retrieval information from the memory to aid in generating accurate answers and persuasive explanations without relying on complex networks and extra datasets. ReRe is an encoder45;decoder architecture model using a pre45;trained clip vision encoder and a pre45;trained GPT45;2 language model as a decoder. Cross45;attention layers are added in the GPT45;2 for processing retrieval features. ReRe outperforms previous methods in VQA accuracy and explanation score and shows improvement in NLE with more persuasive reliability.

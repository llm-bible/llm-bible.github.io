Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in specialized tasks but struggle to
align with evolving domain knowledge without costly fine-tuning. Domain
knowledge consists of: Knowledge: Immutable facts (e.g., 'A stone is solid')
and generally accepted principles (e.g., ethical standards); Refined Memory:
Evolving insights shaped by business needs and real-world changes. However, a
significant gap often exists between a domain expert's deep, nuanced
understanding and the system's domain knowledge, which can hinder accurate
information retrieval and application. Our Memory-Augmented Refinement of
Knowledge (MARK) framework enables LLMs to continuously learn without
retraining by leveraging structured refined memory, inspired by the Society of
Mind. MARK operates through specialized agents, each serving a distinct role:
Residual Refined Memory Agent: Stores and retrieves domain-specific insights to
maintain context over time; User Question Refined Memory Agent: Captures
user-provided facts, abbreviations, and terminology for better comprehension;
LLM Response Refined Memory Agent: Extracts key elements from responses for
refinement and personalization. These agents analyse stored refined memory,
detect patterns, resolve contradictions, and improve response accuracy.
Temporal factors like recency and frequency prioritize relevant information
while discarding outdated insights. MARK enhances LLMs in multiple ways: Ground
Truth Strategy: Reduces hallucinations by establishing a structured reference;
Domain-Specific Adaptation: Essential for fields like healthcare, law, and
manufacturing, where proprietary insights are absent from public datasets;
Personalized AI Assistants: Improves virtual assistants by remembering user
preferences, ensuring coherent responses over time.

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into virtual reality (VR)
environments has opened new pathways for creating more immersive and
interactive digital humans. By leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs
alongside multimodal outputs such as facial expressions and gestures, virtual
agents can simulate human-like personalities and emotions, fostering richer and
more engaging user experiences. This paper provides a comprehensive review of
methods for enabling digital humans to adopt nuanced personality traits,
exploring approaches such as zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning.
Additionally, it highlights the challenges of integrating LLM-driven
personality traits into VR, including computational demands, latency issues,
and the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks for multimodal interactions.
By addressing these gaps, this work lays a foundation for advancing
applications in education, therapy, and gaming, while fostering
interdisciplinary collaboration to redefine human-computer interaction in VR.

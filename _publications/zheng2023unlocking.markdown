Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT/GPT45;4 have proven to be powerful tools in promoting the user experience as an AI assistant. The continuous works are proposing multi45;modal large language models (MLLM) empowering LLMs with the ability to sense multiple modality inputs through constructing a joint semantic space (e.g. visual45;text space). Though significant success was achieved in LLMs and MLLMs exploring LLMs and MLLMs in domain45;specific applications that required domain45;specific knowledge and expertise has been less conducted especially for textbf123;marine domain125;. Different from general45;purpose MLLMs the marine45;specific MLLM is required to yield much more textbf123;sensitive125; textbf123;informative125; and textbf123;scientific125; responses. In this work we demonstrate that the existing MLLMs optimized on huge amounts of readily available general45;purpose training data show a minimal ability to understand domain45;specific intents and then generate informative and satisfactory responses. To address these issues we propose textbf123;MarineGPT125; the first vision45;language model specially designed for the marine domain unlocking the secrets of the ocean to the public. We present our textbf123;Marine45;5M125; dataset with more than 5 million marine image45;text pairs to inject domain45;specific marine knowledge into our model and achieve better marine vision and language alignment. Our MarineGPT not only pushes the boundaries of marine understanding to the general public but also offers a standard protocol for adapting a general45;purpose assistant to downstream domain45;specific experts. We pave the way for a wide range of marine applications while setting valuable data and pre45;trained models for future research in both academic and industrial communities.

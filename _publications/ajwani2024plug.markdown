Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional language generation capabilities in response to text-based prompts. However controlling the direction of generation via textual prompts has been challenging especially with smaller models. In this work we explore the use of Prompt Tuning to achieve controlled language generation. Generated text is steered using prompt embeddings which are trained using a small language model used as a discriminator. Moreover we demonstrate that these prompt embeddings can be trained with a very small dataset with as low as a few hundred training examples. Our method thus offers a data and parameter efficient solution towards controlling language model outputs. We carry out extensive evaluation on four datasets SST-5 and Yelp (sentiment analysis) GYAFC (formality) and JIGSAW (toxic language). Finally we demonstrate the efficacy of our method towards mitigating harmful toxic and biased text generated by language models.

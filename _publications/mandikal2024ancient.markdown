LLMs have revolutionized the landscape of information retrieval and knowledge
dissemination. However, their application in specialized areas is often
hindered by factual inaccuracies and hallucinations, especially in long-tail
knowledge distributions. We explore the potential of retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) models for long-form question answering (LFQA) in a
specialized knowledge domain. We present VedantaNY-10M, a dataset curated from
extensive public discourses on the ancient Indian philosophy of Advaita
Vedanta. We develop and benchmark a RAG model against a standard, non-RAG LLM,
focusing on transcription, retrieval, and generation performance. Human
evaluations by computational linguists and domain experts show that the RAG
model significantly outperforms the standard model in producing factual and
comprehensive responses having fewer hallucinations. In addition, a
keyword-based hybrid retriever that emphasizes unique low-frequency terms
further improves results. Our study provides insights into effectively
integrating modern large language models with ancient knowledge systems.

This paper surveys the development of large language model (LLM)-based agents
for question answering (QA). Traditional agents face significant limitations,
including substantial data requirements and difficulty in generalizing to new
environments. LLM-based agents address these challenges by leveraging LLMs as
their core reasoning engine. These agents achieve superior QA results compared
to traditional QA pipelines and naive LLM QA systems by enabling interaction
with external environments. We systematically review the design of LLM agents
in the context of QA tasks, organizing our discussion across key stages:
planning, question understanding, information retrieval, and answer generation.
Additionally, this paper identifies ongoing challenges and explores future
research directions to enhance the performance of LLM agent QA systems.

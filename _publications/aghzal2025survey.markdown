The planning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered increasing
attention in recent years due to their remarkable capacity for multi-step
reasoning and their ability to generalize across a wide range of domains. While
some researchers emphasize the potential of LLMs to perform complex planning
tasks, others highlight significant limitations in their performance,
particularly when these models are tasked with handling the intricacies of
long-horizon reasoning. In this survey, we critically investigate existing
research on the use of LLMs in automated planning, examining both their
successes and shortcomings in detail. We illustrate that although LLMs are not
well-suited to serve as standalone planners because of these limitations, they
nonetheless present an enormous opportunity to enhance planning applications
when combined with other approaches. Thus, we advocate for a balanced
methodology that leverages the inherent flexibility and generalized knowledge
of LLMs alongside the rigor and cost-effectiveness of traditional planning
methods.

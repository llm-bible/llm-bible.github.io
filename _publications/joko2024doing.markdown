The future of conversational agents will provide users with personalized information responses. However a significant challenge in developing models is the lack of large45;scale dialogue datasets that span multiple sessions and reflect real45;world user preferences. Previous approaches rely on experts in a wizard45;of45;oz setup that is difficult to scale particularly for personalized tasks. Our method LAPS addresses this by using large language models (LLMs) to guide a single human worker in generating personalized dialogues. This method has proven to speed up the creation process and improve quality. LAPS can collect large45;scale human45;written multi45;session and multi45;domain conversations including extracting user preferences. When compared to existing datasets LAPS45;produced conversations are as natural and diverse as expert45;created ones which stays in contrast with fully synthetic methods. The collected dataset is suited to train preference extraction and personalized response generation. Our results show that responses generated explicitly using extracted preferences better match users actual preferences highlighting the value of using extracted preferences over simple dialogue history. Overall LAPS introduces a new method to leverage LLMs to create realistic personalized conversational data more efficiently and effectively than previous methods.

Generative AI proposes several large language models (LLMs) to automatically
generate a message in response to users' requests. Such scientific
breakthroughs promote new writing assistants but with some fears. The main
focus of this study is to analyze the written style of one LLM called ChatGPT
by comparing its generated messages with those of the recent French presidents.
To achieve this, we compare end-of-the-year addresses written by Chirac,
Sarkozy, Hollande, and Macron with those automatically produced by ChatGPT. We
found that ChatGPT tends to overuse nouns, possessive determiners, and numbers.
On the other hand, the generated speeches employ less verbs, pronouns, and
adverbs and include, in mean, too standardized sentences. Considering some
words, one can observe that ChatGPT tends to overuse "to must" (devoir), "to
continue" or the lemma "we" (nous). Moreover, GPT underuses the auxiliary verb
"to be" (^etre), or the modal verbs "to will" (vouloir) or "to have to"
(falloir). In addition, when a short text is provided as example to ChatGPT,
the machine can generate a short message with a style closed to the original
wording. Finally, we reveal that ChatGPT style exposes distinct features
compared to real presidential speeches.

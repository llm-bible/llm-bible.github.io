Effective planning is essential for the success of any task, from organizing
a vacation to routing autonomous vehicles and developing corporate strategies.
It involves setting goals, formulating plans, and allocating resources to
achieve them. LLMs are particularly well-suited for automated planning due to
their strong capabilities in commonsense reasoning. They can deduce a sequence
of actions needed to achieve a goal from a given state and identify an
effective course of action. However, it is frequently observed that plans
generated through direct prompting often fail upon execution. Our survey aims
to highlight the existing challenges in planning with language models, focusing
on key areas such as embodied environments, optimal scheduling, competitive and
cooperative games, task decomposition, reasoning, and planning. Through this
study, we explore how LLMs transform AI planning and provide unique insights
into the future of LM-assisted planning.

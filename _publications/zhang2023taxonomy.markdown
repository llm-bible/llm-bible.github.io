As large language models (LLMs) have been used in many downstream tasks the internal stereotypical representation may affect the fairness of the outputs. In this work we introduce human knowledge into natural language interventions and study pre45;trained language models (LMs) behaviors within the context of gender bias. Inspired by CheckList behavioral testing we present a checklist45;style task that aims to probe and quantify LMs unethical behaviors through question45;answering (QA). We design three comparison studies to evaluate LMs from four aspects consistency biased tendency model preference and gender preference switch. We probe one transformer45;based QA model trained on SQuAD45;v2 dataset and one autoregressive large language model. Our results indicate that transformer45;based QA models biased tendency positively correlates with its consistency whereas LLM shows the opposite relation. Our proposed task provides the first dataset that involves human knowledge for LLM bias evaluation.

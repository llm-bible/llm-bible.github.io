Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has gained wide attention as the key
component to improve generative models with external knowledge augmentation
from information retrieval. It has shown great prominence in enhancing the
functionality and performance of large language model (LLM)-based applications.
However, with the comprehensive application of RAG, more and more problems and
limitations have been identified, thus urgently requiring further fundamental
exploration to improve current RAG frameworks. This workshop aims to explore in
depth how to conduct refined and reliable RAG for downstream AI tasks.
  To this end, we propose to organize the first R3AG workshop at SIGIR-AP 2024
to call for participants to re-examine and formulate the basic principles and
practical implementation of refined and reliable RAG. The workshop serves as a
platform for both academia and industry researchers to conduct discussions,
share insights, and foster research to build the next generation of RAG
systems. Participants will engage in discussions and presentations focusing on
fundamental challenges, cutting-edge research, and potential pathways to
improve RAG. At the end of the workshop, we aim to have a clearer understanding
of how to improve the reliability and applicability of RAG with more robust
information retrieval and language generation.

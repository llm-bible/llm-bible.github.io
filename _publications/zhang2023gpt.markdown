Automatically evaluating vision-language tasks is challenging especially when it comes to reflecting human judgments due to limitations in accounting for fine-grained details. Although GPT-4V has shown promising results in various multi-modal tasks leveraging GPT-4V as a generalist evaluator for these tasks has not yet been systematically explored. We comprehensively validate GPT-4Vs capabilities for evaluation purposes addressing tasks ranging from foundational image-to-text and text-to-image synthesis to high-level image-to-image translations and multi-images to text alignment. We employ two evaluation methods single-answer grading and pairwise comparison using GPT-4V. Notably GPT-4V shows promising agreement with humans across various tasks and evaluation methods demonstrating immense potential for multi-modal LLMs as evaluators. Despite limitations like restricted visual clarity grading and real-world complex reasoning its ability to provide human-aligned scores enriched with detailed explanations is promising for universal automatic evaluator.

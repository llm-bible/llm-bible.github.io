Automatically evaluating vision45;language tasks is challenging especially when it comes to reflecting human judgments due to limitations in accounting for fine45;grained details. Although GPT45;4V has shown promising results in various multi45;modal tasks leveraging GPT45;4V as a generalist evaluator for these tasks has not yet been systematically explored. We comprehensively validate GPT45;4Vs capabilities for evaluation purposes addressing tasks ranging from foundational image45;to45;text and text45;to45;image synthesis to high45;level image45;to45;image translations and multi45;images to text alignment. We employ two evaluation methods single45;answer grading and pairwise comparison using GPT45;4V. Notably GPT45;4V shows promising agreement with humans across various tasks and evaluation methods demonstrating immense potential for multi45;modal LLMs as evaluators. Despite limitations like restricted visual clarity grading and real45;world complex reasoning its ability to provide human45;aligned scores enriched with detailed explanations is promising for universal automatic evaluator.

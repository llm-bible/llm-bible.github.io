Recent research in Large Language Models (LLMs), has had a profound impact
across various fields, including mobility data science. This paper explores the
and experiment with different approaches to using LLMs for analyzing AIS data.
We propose a set of carefully designed queries to assess the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in this kind of tasks. Further, we experiment with four
different methods: (1) using LLMs as a natural language interface to a spatial
database, (2) reasoning on raw data, (3) reasoning on compressed trajectories,
and (4) reasoning on semantic trajectories. We investigate the strengths and
weaknesses for the four methods, and discuss the findings. The goal is to
provide valuable insights for both researchers and practitioners on selecting
the most appropriate LLM-based method depending on their specific data analysis
objectives.

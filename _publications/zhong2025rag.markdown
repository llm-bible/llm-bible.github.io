Scaling automated formal verification to real-world projects requires
resolving cross-module dependencies and global contexts, which are challenges
overlooked by existing function-centric methods. We introduce RagVerus, a
framework that synergizes retrieval-augmented generation with context-aware
prompting to automate proof synthesis for multi-module repositories, achieving
a 27% relative improvement on our novel RepoVBench benchmark -- the first
repository-level dataset for Verus with 383 proof completion tasks. RagVerus
triples proof pass rates on existing benchmarks under constrained language
model budgets, demonstrating a scalable and sample-efficient verification.

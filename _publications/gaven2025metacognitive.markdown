Open-ended learning agents must efficiently prioritize goals in vast
possibility spaces, focusing on those that maximize learning progress (LP).
When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online
RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP
prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive
monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on
brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive
framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online.
By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables
sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces
through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that
MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the
only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space.
These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive
ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to
open-ended goal spaces.

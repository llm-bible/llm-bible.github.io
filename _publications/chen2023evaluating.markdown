Detecting factual errors in summaries has been an important and challenging
subject in summarization research. Inspired by the emergent ability of large
language models (LLMs), we explore evaluating factual consistency of summaries
by directly prompting LLMs. We present a comprehensive empirical study to
assess the ability of LLMs as factual consistency evaluators, which consists of
(1) analyzing different LLMs such as the GPT model series and Flan-T5; (2)
investigating a variety of prompting methods including vanilla prompting,
chain-of-thought prompting, and a sentence-by-sentence prompting method to
tackle long summaries; and (3) evaluating on diverse summaries generated by
multiple summarization systems, ranging from pre-transformer methods to SOTA
pretrained models. Our experiments demonstrate that prompting LLMs is able to
outperform the previous best factuality systems in all settings, by up to 12.2
absolute points in terms of the binary classification accuracy on inconsistency
detection.

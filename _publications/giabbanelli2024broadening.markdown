Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming ubiquitous to create intelligent
virtual assistants that assist users in interacting with a system, as
exemplified in marketing. Although LLMs have been discussed in Modeling &
Simulation (M&S), the community has focused on generating code or explaining
results. We examine the possibility of using LLMs to broaden access to
simulations, by enabling non-simulation end-users to ask what-if questions in
everyday language. Specifically, we discuss the opportunities and challenges in
designing such an end-to-end system, divided into three broad phases. First,
assuming the general case in which several simulation models are available,
textual queries are mapped to the most relevant model. Second, if a mapping
cannot be found, the query can be automatically reformulated and clarifying
questions can be generated. Finally, simulation results are produced and
contextualized for decision-making. Our vision for such system articulates
long-term research opportunities spanning M&S, LLMs, information retrieval, and
ethics.

This paper introduces WordArt Designer, a user-driven framework for artistic
typography synthesis, relying on the Large Language Model (LLM). The system
incorporates four key modules: the LLM Engine, SemTypo, StyTypo, and TexTypo
modules. 1) The LLM Engine, empowered by the LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5), interprets
user inputs and generates actionable prompts for the other modules, thereby
transforming abstract concepts into tangible designs. 2) The SemTypo module
optimizes font designs using semantic concepts, striking a balance between
artistic transformation and readability. 3) Building on the semantic layout
provided by the SemTypo module, the StyTypo module creates smooth, refined
images. 4) The TexTypo module further enhances the design's aesthetics through
texture rendering, enabling the generation of inventive textured fonts.
Notably, WordArt Designer highlights the fusion of generative AI with artistic
typography. Experience its capabilities on ModelScope:

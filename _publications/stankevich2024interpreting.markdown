Robots are increasingly common in industry and daily life such as in nursing homes where they can assist staff. A key challenge is developing intuitive interfaces for easy communication. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 has enhanced robot capabilities allowing for real-time interaction and decision-making. This integration improves robots adaptability and functionality. This project focuses on merging LLMs with databases to improve decision-making and enable knowledge acquisition for request interpretation problems.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have lately been on the spotlight of
researchers, businesses, and consumers alike. While the linguistic capabilities
of such models have been studied extensively, there is growing interest in
investigating them as cognitive subjects. In the present work I examine GPT-3
and ChatGPT capabilities on an limited-data inductive reasoning task from the
cognitive science literature. The results suggest that these models' cognitive
judgements are not human-like.

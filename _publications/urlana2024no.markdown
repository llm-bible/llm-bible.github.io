Large language models (LLMs) are playing a pivotal role in deploying
strategic use cases across a range of organizations, from large pan-continental
companies to emerging startups. The issues and challenges involved in the
successful utilization of LLMs can vary significantly depending on the size of
the organization. It is important to study and discuss these pertinent issues
of LLM adaptation with a focus on the scale of the industrial concerns and
brainstorm possible solutions and prospective directions. Such a study has not
been prominently featured in the current research literature. In this study, we
adopt a threefold strategy: first, we conduct a case study with industry
practitioners to formulate the key research questions; second, we examine
existing industrial publications to address these questions; and finally, we
provide a practical guide for industries to utilize LLMs more efficiently. We
release the
GitHub\footnote\{\url\{https://github.com/vinayakcse/IndustrialLLMsPapers\}\}
repository with the most recent papers in the field.

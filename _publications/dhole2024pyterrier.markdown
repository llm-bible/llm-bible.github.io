Using LLMs as rerankers requires experimenting with various hyperparameters,
such as prompt formats, model choice, and reformulation strategies. We
introduce PyTerrier-GenRank, a PyTerrier plugin to facilitate seamless
reranking experiments with LLMs, supporting popular ranking strategies like
pointwise and listwise prompting. We validate our plugin through HuggingFace
and OpenAI hosted endpoints.

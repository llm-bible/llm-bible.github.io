Recent advancements in NLP systems particularly with the introduction of LLMs have led to widespread adoption of these systems by a broad spectrum of users across various domains impacting decision45;making the job market society and scientific research. This surge in usage has led to an explosion in NLP model interpretability and analysis research accompanied by numerous technical surveys. Yet these surveys often overlook the needs and perspectives of explanation stakeholders. In this paper we address three fundamental questions Why do we need interpretability what are we interpreting and how By exploring these questions we examine existing interpretability paradigms their properties and their relevance to different stakeholders. We further explore the practical implications of these paradigms by analyzing trends from the past decade across multiple research fields. To this end we retrieved thousands of papers and employed an LLM to characterize them. Our analysis reveals significant disparities between NLP developers and non45;developer users as well as between research fields underscoring the diverse needs of stakeholders. For example explanations of internal model components are rarely used outside the NLP field. We hope this paper informs the future design development and application of methods that align with the objectives and requirements of various stakeholders.

Obtaining data in the medical field is challenging, making the adoption of AI
technology within the space slow and high-risk. We evaluate whether we can
overcome this obstacle with synthetic data generated by large language models
(LLMs). In particular, we use GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus to create agents that
simulate adults with varying profiles, childhood memories, and attachment
styles. These agents participate in simulated Adult Attachment Interviews
(AAI), and we use their responses to train models for predicting their
underlying attachment styles. We evaluate our models using a transcript dataset
from 9 humans who underwent the same interview protocol, analyzed and labeled
by mental health professionals. Our findings indicate that training the models
using only synthetic data achieves performance comparable to training the
models on human data. Additionally, while the raw embeddings from synthetic
answers occupy a distinct space compared to those from real human responses,
the introduction of unlabeled human data and a simple standardization allows
for a closer alignment of these representations. This adjustment is supported
by qualitative analyses and is reflected in the enhanced predictive accuracy of
the standardized embeddings.

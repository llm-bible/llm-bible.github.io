With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), notably characterized by GPT
frameworks, there emerges a catalyst for novel healthcare applications. Earlier
iterations of chatbot caregivers, though existent, have yet to achieve a
dimension of human-like authenticity. This paper unveils `MemoryCompanion' a
pioneering digital health solution explicitly tailored for Alzheimer's disease
(AD) patients and their caregivers. Drawing upon the nuances of GPT technology
and prompt engineering, MemoryCompanion manifests a personalized caregiving
paradigm, fostering interactions via voice-cloning and talking-face mechanisms
that resonate with the familiarity of known companions. Using advanced
prompt-engineering, the system intricately adapts to each patient's distinct
profile, curating its content and communication style accordingly. This
approach strives to counteract prevalent issues of social isolation and
loneliness frequently observed in AD demographics. Our methodology, grounded in
its innovative design, addresses both the caregiving and technological
challenges intrinsic to this domain.

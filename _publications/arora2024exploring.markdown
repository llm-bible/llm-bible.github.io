Large language models (LLMs) are used for long45;form question answering (LFQA) which requires them to generate paragraph45;length answers to complex questions. While LFQA has been well45;studied in English this research has not been extended to other languages. To bridge this gap we introduce CaLMQA a collection of 1.5K complex culturally specific questions spanning 23 languages and 51 culturally agnostic questions translated from English into 22 other languages. We define culturally specific questions as those uniquely or more likely to be asked by people from cultures associated with the questions language. We collect naturally45;occurring questions from community web forums and hire native speakers to write questions to cover under45;resourced rarely45;studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our dataset contains diverse complex questions that reflect cultural topics (e.g. traditions laws news) and the language usage of native speakers. We automatically evaluate a suite of open45; and closed45;source models on CaLMQA by detecting incorrect language and token repetitions in answers and observe that the quality of LLM45;generated answers degrades significantly for some low45;resource languages. Lastly we perform human evaluation on a subset of models and languages. Manual evaluation reveals that model performance is significantly worse for culturally specific questions than for culturally agnostic questions. Our findings highlight the need for further research in non45;English LFQA and provide an evaluation framework.

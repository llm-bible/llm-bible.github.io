Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT series and Llama series have
demonstrated strong capabilities in natural language processing, contextual
understanding, and text generation. In recent years, researchers are trying to
enhance the abilities of LLMs in performing various tasks, and numerous studies
have proved that well-designed prompts can significantly improve the
performance of LLMs on these tasks. This study compares the language style
imitation ability of three different large language models under the guidance
of the same zero-shot prompt. It also involves comparing the imitation ability
of the same large language model when guided by three different prompts
individually. Additionally, by applying a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Prompting
method to Llama 3, a conversational AI with the language style of a real person
was created. In this study, three evaluation methods were used to evaluate LLMs
and prompts. The results show that Llama 3 performs best at imitating language
styles, and that the ToT prompting method is the most effective to guide it in
imitating language styles. Using a ToT framework, Llama 3 was guided to
interact with users in the language style of a specific individual without
altering its core parameters, thereby creating a text-based conversational AI
that reflects the language style of the individual.

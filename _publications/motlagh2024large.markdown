The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized our comprehension
of intelligence bringing us closer to Artificial Intelligence. Since their
introduction, researchers have actively explored the applications of LLMs
across diverse fields, significantly elevating capabilities. Cybersecurity,
traditionally resistant to data-driven solutions and slow to embrace machine
learning, stands out as a domain. This study examines the existing literature,
providing a thorough characterization of both defensive and adversarial
applications of LLMs within the realm of cybersecurity. Our review not only
surveys and categorizes the current landscape but also identifies critical
research gaps. By evaluating both offensive and defensive applications, we aim
to provide a holistic understanding of the potential risks and opportunities
associated with LLM-driven cybersecurity.

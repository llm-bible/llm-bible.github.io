This study examines the integration of generative AI in schools, assessing
its benefits and risks. As AI use by students grows, it's crucial to understand
its impact on learning and teaching practices. Generative AI, like ChatGPT, can
create human-like content, prompting questions about its educational role. The
article differentiates large language models from traditional search engines
and stresses the need for students to develop critical source evaluation
skills. Although empirical evidence on AI's classroom effects is limited, AI
offers personalized learning support and problem-solving tools, alongside
challenges like undermining deep learning if misused. The study emphasizes
deliberate strategies to ensure AI complements, not replaces, genuine cognitive
effort. AI's educational role should be context-dependent, guided by
pedagogical goals. The study concludes with practical advice for teachers on
effectively utilizing AI to promote understanding and critical engagement,
advocating for a balanced approach to enhance students' knowledge and skills
development.

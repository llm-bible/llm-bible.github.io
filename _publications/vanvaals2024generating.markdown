Broca's aphasia is a type of aphasia characterized by non-fluent, effortful
and fragmented speech production with relatively good comprehension. Since
traditional aphasia treatment methods are often time-consuming,
labour-intensive, and do not reflect real-world conversations, applying natural
language processing based approaches such as Large Language Models (LLMs) could
potentially contribute to improving existing treatment approaches. To address
this issue, we explore the use of sequence-to-sequence LLMs for completing
fragmented Broca's aphasic sentences. We first generate synthetic Broca's
aphasic data using a rule-based system designed to mirror the linguistic
characteristics of Broca's aphasic speech. Using this synthetic data, we then
fine-tune four pre-trained LLMs on the task of completing fragmented sentences.
We evaluate our fine-tuned models on both synthetic and authentic Broca's
aphasic data. We demonstrate LLMs' capability for reconstructing fragmented
sentences, with the models showing improved performance with longer input
utterances. Our result highlights the LLMs' potential in advancing
communication aids for individuals with Broca's aphasia and possibly other
clinical populations.

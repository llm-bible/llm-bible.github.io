This study evaluates the baseline capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to learn concepts in music theory
through in-context learning and chain-of-thought prompting. Using carefully
designed prompts (in-context learning) and step-by-step worked examples
(chain-of-thought prompting), we explore how LLMs can be taught increasingly
complex material and how pedagogical strategies for human learners translate to
educating machines. Performance is evaluated using questions from an official
Canadian Royal Conservatory of Music (RCM) Level 6 examination, which covers a
comprehensive range of topics, including interval and chord identification, key
detection, cadence classification, and metrical analysis. Additionally, we
evaluate the suitability of various music encoding formats for these tasks
(ABC, Humdrum, MEI, MusicXML). All experiments were run both with and without
contextual prompts. Results indicate that without context, ChatGPT with MEI
performs the best at 52%, while with context, Claude with MEI performs the best
at 75%. Future work will further refine prompts and expand to cover more
advanced music theory concepts. This research contributes to the broader
understanding of teaching LLMs and has applications for educators, students,
and developers of AI music tools alike.

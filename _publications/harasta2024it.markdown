Large Language Models (LLMs) enable a future in which certain types of legal
documents may be generated automatically. This has a great potential to
streamline legal processes, lower the cost of legal services, and dramatically
increase access to justice. While many researchers focus on proposing and
evaluating LLM-based applications supporting tasks in the legal domain, there
is a notable lack of investigations into how legal professionals perceive
content if they believe an LLM has generated it. Yet, this is a critical point
as over-reliance or unfounded scepticism may influence whether such documents
bring about appropriate legal consequences. This study is the necessary
analysis of the ongoing transition towards mature generative AI systems.
Specifically, we examined whether the perception of legal documents' by lawyers
and law students (n=75) varies based on their assumed origin (human-crafted vs
AI-generated). The participants evaluated the documents, focusing on their
correctness and language quality. Our analysis revealed a clear preference for
documents perceived as crafted by a human over those believed to be generated
by AI. At the same time, most participants expect the future in which documents
will be generated automatically. These findings could be leveraged by legal
practitioners, policymakers, and legislators to implement and adopt legal
document generation technology responsibly and to fuel the necessary
discussions on how legal processes should be updated to reflect recent
technological developments.

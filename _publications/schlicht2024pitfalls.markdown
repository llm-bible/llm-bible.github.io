This paper addresses debiasing in news editing and evaluates the effectiveness of conversational Large Language Models in this task. We designed an evaluation checklist tailored to news editors perspectives obtained generated texts from three popular conversational models using a subset of a publicly available dataset in media bias and evaluated the texts according to the designed checklist. Furthermore we examined the models as evaluator for checking the quality of debiased model outputs. Our findings indicate that none of the LLMs are perfect in debiasing. Notably some models including ChatGPT introduced unnecessary changes that may impact the authors style and create misinformation. Lastly we show that the models do not perform as proficiently as domain experts in evaluating the quality of debiased outputs.

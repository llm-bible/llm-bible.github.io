We address the main problem of self45;learning LLM the question of what to learn. We propose a self45;learning LLM framework that enables an LLM to independently learn previously unknown knowledge through self45;assessment of their own hallucinations. We introduce a concept called Point in the Unknown (PiU) to identify atomic knowledge unknown to a model along with four methods for automatic PiUs identification facilitating the creation of a self45;learning loop that focuses exclusively on the absorption of currently unknown knowledge into the model. Additionally we developed evaluation metrics to gauge an LLMs self45;learning capability. Our experiments revealed that LLMs with at least 3B parameters that have undergone some instruction training would be able to perform self45;learning well. We further proved the effectiveness of self45;learning by comparing the performance of a model that has undergone self45;learning to a model that has not. Our self45;learning concept allows more efficient LLM updates and opens new perspectives for LLM knowledge exchange.

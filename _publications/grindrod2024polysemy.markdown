The transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), is at the heart of the remarkable recent progress in the development of language models, including famous chatbots such as Chat-gpt and Bard. In this paper, I argue that we an extract from the way the transformer architecture works a picture of the relationship between context and meaning. I call this the transformer picture, and I argue that it is a novel with regard to two related philosophical debates: the contextualism debate regarding the extent of context-sensitivity across natural language, and the polysemy debate regarding how polysemy should be captured within an account of word meaning. Although much of the paper merely tries to position the transformer picture with respect to these two debates, I will also begin to make the case for the transformer picture.

Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for role45;playing enabling them to embody not only human characters but also non45;human entities. This versatility allows them to simulate complex human45;like interactions and behaviors within various contexts as well as to emulate specific objects or systems. While these capabilities have enhanced user engagement and introduced novel modes of interaction the influence of role45;playing on LLMs reasoning abilities remains underexplored. In this study we introduce a strategically designed role45;play prompting methodology and assess its performance under the zero45;shot setting across twelve diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our empirical results illustrate that role45;play prompting consistently surpasses the standard zero45;shot approach across most datasets. Notably in experiments conducted using ChatGPT accuracy on AQuA rises from 53.537; to 63.837; and on Last Letter from 23.837; to 84.237;.Upon further comparison with the Zero45;Shot45;CoT technique which prompts the model to think step by step our study demonstrates that role45;play prompting acts as a more effective trigger for the CoT process. This highlights its potential to augment the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We release our code at https://github.com/NKU&#45;HLT/Role&#45;Play&#45;Prompting.

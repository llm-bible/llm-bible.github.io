Alzheimer's disease (AD) stands as the predominant cause of dementia,
characterized by a gradual decline in speech and language capabilities. Recent
deep-learning advancements have facilitated automated AD detection through
spontaneous speech. However, common transcript-based detection methods directly
model text patterns in each utterance without a global view of the patient's
linguistic characteristics, resulting in limited discriminability and
interpretability. Despite the enhanced reasoning abilities of large language
models (LLMs), there remains a gap in fully harnessing the reasoning ability to
facilitate AD detection and model interpretation. Therefore, we propose a
patient-level transcript profiling framework leveraging LLM-based reasoning
augmentation to systematically elicit linguistic deficit attributes. The
summarized embeddings of the attributes are integrated into an Albert model for
AD detection. The framework achieves 8.51% ACC and 8.34% F1 improvements on
the ADReSS dataset compared to the baseline without reasoning augmentation. Our
further analysis shows the effectiveness of our identified linguistic deficit
attributes and the potential to use LLM for AD detection interpretation.

The field of large language models (LLMs) has grown rapidly in recent years,
driven by the desire for better efficiency, interpretability, and safe use.
Building on the novel approach of "activation engineering," this study explores
personality modification in LLMs, drawing inspiration from research like
Refusal in LLMs Is Mediated by a Single Direction (arXiv:2406.11717) and
Steering Llama 2 via Contrastive Activation Addition (arXiv:2312.06681). We
leverage activation engineering to develop a method for identifying and
adjusting activation directions related to personality traits, which may allow
for dynamic LLM personality fine-tuning. This work aims to further our
understanding of LLM interpretability while examining the ethical implications
of such developments.

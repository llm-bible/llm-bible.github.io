Large language model (LLM) applications such as ChatGPT are a powerful tool for online information45;seeking (IS) and problem45;solving tasks. However users still face challenges initializing and refining prompts and their cognitive barriers and biased perceptions further impede task completion. These issues reflect broader challenges identified within the fields of IS and interactive information retrieval (IIR). To address these our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human45;ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT45;like platform integrated with supportive functions including perception articulation prompt suggestion and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations reduce cognitive loads better refine prompts and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user45;centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human45;LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users.

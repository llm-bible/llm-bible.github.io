Large language models (LLMs) fine45;tuned for text45;retrieval have demonstrated state45;of45;the45;art results across several information retrieval (IR) benchmarks. However supervised training for improving these models requires numerous labeled examples which are generally unavailable or expensive to acquire. In this work we explore the effectiveness of extending reverse engineered adaptation to the context of information retrieval (RE45;AdaptIR). We use RE45;AdaptIR to improve LLM45;based IR models using only unlabeled data. We demonstrate improved performance both in training domains as well as zero45;shot in domains where the models have seen no queries. We analyze performance changes in various fine45;tuning scenarios and offer findings of immediate use to practitioners.

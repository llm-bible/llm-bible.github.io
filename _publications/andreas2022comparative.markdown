The recent development of language models has shown promising results by
achieving state-of-the-art performance on various natural language tasks by
fine-tuning pretrained models. In task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems,
language models can be used for end-to-end training without relying on dialogue
state tracking to track the dialogue history but allowing the language models
to generate responses according to the context given as input. This paper
conducts a comparative study to show the effectiveness and strength of using
recent pretrained models for fine-tuning, such as BART and T5, on endto-end ToD
systems. The experimental results show substantial performance improvements
after language model fine-tuning. The models produce more fluent responses
after adding knowledge to the context that guides the model to avoid
hallucination and generate accurate entities in the generated responses.
Furthermore, we found that BART and T5 outperform GPT-based models in BLEU and
F1 scores and achieve state-of-the-art performance in a ToD system.

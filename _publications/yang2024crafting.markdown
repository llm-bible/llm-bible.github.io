Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable ability to comprehend
instructions and generate human-like text, enabling sophisticated agent
simulation beyond basic behavior replication. However, the potential for
creating freely customisable characters remains underexplored. We introduce the
Customisable Conversation Agent Framework, which employs LLMs to simulate
real-world characters through personalised characteristic feature injection,
enabling diverse character creation according to user preferences. We propose
the SimsConv dataset, comprising 68 customised characters and 13,971 multi-turn
role-playing dialogues across 1,360 real-world scenes. Characters are initially
customised using pre-defined elements (career, aspiration, traits, skills),
then expanded through personal and social profiles. Building on this, we
present SimsChat, a freely customisable role-playing agent incorporating
various realistic settings and topic-specified character interactions.
Experimental results on both SimsConv and WikiRoleEval datasets demonstrate
SimsChat's superior performance in maintaining character consistency, knowledge
accuracy, and appropriate question rejection compared to existing models. Our
framework provides valuable insights for developing more accurate and
customisable human simulacra. Our data and code are publicly available at

Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate a remarkable ability to comprehend human instructions and generate high-quality text. This capability allows LLMs to function as agents that can emulate human beings at a more sophisticated level beyond the mere replication of basic human behaviours. However there is a lack of exploring into leveraging LLMs to craft characters from diverse aspects. In this work we introduce the Customisable Conversation Agent Framework which leverages LLMs to simulate real-world characters that can be freely customised according to various user preferences. This adaptable framework is beneficial for the design of customisable characters and role-playing agents aligned with human preferences. We propose the SimsConv dataset which encompasses 68 different customised characters 1360 multi-turn role-playing dialogues and a total of 13971 interaction dialogues. The characters are created from several real-world elements such as career aspiration trait and skill. Building upon these foundations we present SimsChat a freely customisable role-playing agent. It incorporates diverse real-world scenes and topic-specific character interaction dialogues thereby simulating characters life experiences in various scenarios and topic-specific interactions with specific emotions. Experimental results indicate that our proposed framework achieves desirable performance and provides a valuable guideline for the construction of more accurate human simulacra in the future.

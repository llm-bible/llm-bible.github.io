Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to act like planners that can decompose high45;level instructions into a sequence of executable instructions. However current LLM45;based planners are only able to operate with a fixed set of skills. We overcome this critical limitation and present a method for using LLM45;based planners to query new skills and teach robots these skills in a data and time45;efficient manner for rigid object manipulation. Our system can re45;use newly acquired skills for future tasks demonstrating the potential of open world and lifelong learning. We evaluate the proposed framework on multiple tasks in simulation and the real world. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/mit.edu/halp&#45;robot&#45;learning.

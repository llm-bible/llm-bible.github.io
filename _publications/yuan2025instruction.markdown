Story understanding and generation have long been a challenging task in
natural language processing (NLP), especially when dealing with various levels
of instruction specificity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called
"Weak to Strong Instruction Tuning" for improving story generation by tuning
models with instructions of varying clarity. We explore the potential of large
language models (LLMs) to adapt to different types of instructions, weak and
strong, and show that our method significantly enhances performance in story
comprehension and generation. By leveraging the strength of instruction tuning,
we train models to understand the nuances of story plots, characters, and
themes while generating coherent and engaging narratives. Through extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets and comparison with state-of-the-art
baselines, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques,
yielding substantial improvements in both automatic evaluation metrics and
human evaluations. Our work shows that adaptive instruction tuning can be a
powerful tool in refining generative models for complex narrative tasks.

Cross45;lingual Machine Translation (MT) quality estimation plays a crucial role in evaluating translation performance. GEMBA the first MT quality assessment metric based on Large Language Models (LLMs) employs one45;step prompting to achieve state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) in system45;level MT quality estimation; however it lacks segment45;level analysis. In contrast Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) prompting outperforms one45;step prompting by offering improved reasoning and explainability. In this paper we introduce Knowledge45;Prompted Estimator (KPE) a CoT prompting method that combines three one45;step prompting techniques including perplexity token45;level similarity and sentence45;level similarity. This method attains enhanced performance for segment45;level estimation compared with previous deep learning models and one45;step prompting approaches. Furthermore supplementary experiments on word45;level visualized alignment demonstrate that our KPE method significantly improves token alignment compared with earlier models and provides better interpretability for MT quality estimation. Code will be released upon publication.

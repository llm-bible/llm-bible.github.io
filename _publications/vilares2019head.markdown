We present HEAD-QA, a multi-choice question answering testbed to encourage
research on complex reasoning. The questions come from exams to access a
specialized position in the Spanish healthcare system, and are challenging even
for highly specialized humans. We then consider monolingual (Spanish) and
cross-lingual (to English) experiments with information retrieval and neural
techniques. We show that: (i) HEAD-QA challenges current methods, and (ii) the
results lag well behind human performance, demonstrating its usefulness as a
benchmark for future work.

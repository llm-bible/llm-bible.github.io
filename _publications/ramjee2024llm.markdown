The healthcare landscape is evolving, with patients seeking reliable
information about their health conditions and available treatment options.
Despite the abundance of information sources, the digital age overwhelms
individuals with excess, often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust
medical professionals, highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health
information. However, increased patient loads on experts has led to reduced
communication time, impacting information sharing. To address this gap, we
developed CataractBot. CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions
instantly using an LLM to query a curated knowledge base, and provides
expert-verified responses asynchronously. It has multimodal and multilingual
capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 49 patients and
attendants, 4 doctors, and 2 patient coordinators, CataractBot demonstrated
potential, providing anytime accessibility, saving time, accommodating diverse
literacy levels, alleviating power differences, and adding a privacy layer
between patients and doctors. Users reported that their trust in the system was
established through expert verification. Broadly, our results could inform
future work on expert-mediated LLM bots.

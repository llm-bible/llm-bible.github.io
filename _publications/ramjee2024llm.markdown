The healthcare landscape is evolving with patients seeking more reliable information about their health conditions treatment options and potential risks. Despite the abundance of information sources the digital age overwhelms individuals with excess often inaccurate information. Patients primarily trust doctors and hospital staff highlighting the need for expert-endorsed health information. However the pressure on experts has led to reduced communication time impacting information sharing. To address this gap we propose CataractBot an experts-in-the-loop chatbot powered by large language models (LLMs). Developed in collaboration with a tertiary eye hospital in India CataractBot answers cataract surgery related questions instantly by querying a curated knowledge base and provides expert-verified responses asynchronously. CataractBot features multimodal support and multilingual capabilities. In an in-the-wild deployment study with 49 participants CataractBot proved valuable providing anytime accessibility saving time and accommodating diverse literacy levels. Trust was established through expert verification. Broadly our results could inform future work on designing expert-mediated LLM bots.

Tool use, planning, and feedback learning are currently three prominent
paradigms for developing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents across various
tasks. Although numerous frameworks have been devised for each paradigm, their
intricate workflows and inconsistent taxonomy create challenges in
understanding and reviewing the frameworks across different paradigms. This
survey introduces a unified taxonomy to systematically review and discuss these
frameworks. Specifically, 1) the taxonomy defines environments/tasks, common
LLM-profiled roles or LMPRs (policy models, evaluators, and dynamic models),
and universally applicable workflows found in prior work, and 2) it enables a
comparison of key perspectives on the implementations of LMPRs and workflow
designs across different agent paradigms and frameworks. 3) Finally, we
identify three limitations in existing workflow designs and systematically
discuss the future work. Resources have been made publicly available at in our
GitHub repository https://github.com/xinzhel/LLM-Agent-Survey.

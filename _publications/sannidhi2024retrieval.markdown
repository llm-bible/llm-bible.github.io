Pre45;trained large language models (PLLMs) like OpenAI ChatGPT and Google Gemini face challenges such as inaccurate factual recall hallucinations biases and future data leakage for temporal Knowledge Graph (tKG) forecasting. To address these issues we introduce sLA45;tKGF (small45;scale language assistant for tKG forecasting) which utilizes Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) aided custom45;trained small45;scale language models through a tabula rasa approach from scratch for effective tKG forecasting. Our framework constructs knowledge45;infused prompts with relevant historical data from tKGs web search results and PLLMs45;generated textual descriptions to understand historical entity relationships prior to the target time. It leverages these external knowledge45;infused prompts for deeper understanding and reasoning of context45;specific semantic and temporal information to zero45;shot prompt small45;scale language models for more accurate predictions of future events within tKGs. It reduces hallucinations and mitigates distributional shift challenges through comprehending changing trends over time. As a result it enables more accurate and contextually grounded forecasts of future events while minimizing computational demands. Rigorous empirical studies demonstrate our framework robustness scalability and state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) performance on benchmark datasets with interpretable and trustworthy tKG forecasting.

This study evaluates the forecasting performance of recent language models
(LLMs) on binary forecasting questions. We first introduce a novel dataset of
over 600 binary forecasting questions, augmented with related news articles and
their concise question-related summaries. We then explore the impact of input
prompts with varying level of context on forecasting performance. The results
indicate that incorporating news articles significantly improves performance,
while using few-shot examples leads to a decline in accuracy. We find that
larger models consistently outperform smaller models, highlighting the
potential of LLMs in enhancing automated forecasting.

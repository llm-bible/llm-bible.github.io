Large Language Models prompting such as using in45;context demonstrations is a mainstream technique for invoking LLMs to perform high45;performance and solid complex reasoning (e.g. mathematical reasoning commonsense reasoning) and has the potential for further human45;machine collaborative scientific findings. However current LLMs are delicate and elusive in prompt words and styles. And there is an unseen gap between LLM understanding and human45;written prompts. This paper introduces AlignedCoT an LLM45;acquainted prompting technique that includes proficient native45;speaking in in45;context learning for the LLMs. Specifically it achieves consistent and correct step45;wise prompts in zero45;shot scenarios by progressively probing refining and formatting the LLM chain of thoughts so that free from handcrafted few45;shot demonstrations while maintaining the prompt quality. We conduct experiments on mathematical reasoning and commonsense reasoning. We find that LLMs with AlignedCoT perform significantly superior to them with human45;crafted demonstrations. We further apply AlignedCoT for rewriting the GSM8k training set resulting in a GSM8k45;Align dataset. We observe its benefits for retrieval augmented generation.

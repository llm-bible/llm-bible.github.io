A widespread view is that Artificial Intelligence cannot be creative. We
tested this assumption by comparing human-generated ideas with those generated
by six Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) chatbots: \\(alpa.\!ai\\),
\\(Copy.\!ai\\), ChatGPT (versions 3 and 4), \\(Studio.\!ai\\), and YouChat. Humans and
a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of
ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated
creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated.
Interestingly, 9.4 percent of humans were more creative than the most creative
GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the
creative process. Continued research and development of GAI in creative tasks
is crucial to fully understand this technology's potential benefits and
drawbacks in shaping the future of creativity. Finally, we discuss the question
of whether GAIs are capable of being truly creative.

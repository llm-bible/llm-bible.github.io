When large language models (LLMs) are asked to perform certain tasks, how can
we be sure that their learned representations align with reality? We propose a
domain-agnostic framework for systematically evaluating distribution shifts in
LLMs decision-making processes, where they are given control of mechanisms
governed by pre-defined rules. While individual LLM actions may appear
consistent with expected behavior, across a large number of trials,
statistically significant distribution shifts can emerge. To test this, we
construct a well-defined environment with known outcome logic: blackjack. In
more than 1,000 trials, we uncover statistically significant evidence
suggesting behavioral misalignment in the learned representations of LLM.

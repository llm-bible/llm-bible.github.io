In this paper we present a novel approach to simulating H.P. Lovecrafts horror literature using the ChatGPT large language model specifically the GPT-4 architecture. Our study aims to generate text that emulates Lovecrafts unique writing style and themes while also examining the effectiveness of prompt engineering techniques in guiding the models output. To achieve this we curated a prompt containing several specialized literature references and employed advanced prompt engineering methods. We conducted an empirical evaluation of the generated text by administering a survey to a sample of undergraduate students. Utilizing statistical hypothesis testing we assessed the students ability to distinguish between genuine Lovecraft works and those generated by our model. Our findings demonstrate that the participants were unable to reliably differentiate between the two indicating the effectiveness of the GPT-4 model and our prompt engineering techniques in emulating Lovecrafts literary style. In addition to presenting the GPT models capabilities this paper provides a comprehensive description of its underlying architecture and offers a comparative analysis with related work that simulates other notable authors and philosophers such as Dennett. By exploring the potential of large language models in the context of literary emulation our study contributes to the body of research on the applications and limitations of these models in various creative domains.

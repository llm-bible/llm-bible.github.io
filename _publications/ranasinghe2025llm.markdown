Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being leveraged for generating
and translating scientific computer codes by both domain-experts and non-domain
experts. Fortran has served as one of the go to programming languages in legacy
high-performance computing (HPC) for scientific discoveries. Despite growing
adoption, LLM-based code translation of legacy code-bases has not been
thoroughly assessed or quantified for its usability. Here, we studied the
applicability of LLM-based translation of Fortran to C++ as a step towards
building an agentic-workflow using open-weight LLMs on two different
computational platforms. We statistically quantified the compilation accuracy
of the translated C++ codes, measured the similarity of the LLM translated code
to the human translated C++ code, and statistically quantified the output
similarity of the Fortran to C++ translation.

In this paper we propose MPC (Modular Prompted Chatbot) a new approach for creating high45;quality conversational agents without the need for fine45;tuning. Our method utilizes pre45;trained large language models (LLMs) as individual modules for long45;term consistency and flexibility by using techniques such as few45;shot prompting chain45;of45;thought (CoT) and external memory. Our human evaluation results show that MPC is on par with fine45;tuned chatbot models in open45;domain conversations making it an effective solution for creating consistent and engaging chatbots.

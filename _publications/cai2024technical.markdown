The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT45;4 has sparked discussions on the advent of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However replicating such advancements in open45;source models has been challenging. This paper introduces InternLM2 an open45;source LLM that outperforms its predecessors in comprehensive evaluations across 6 dimensions and 30 benchmarks long45;context modeling and open45;ended subjective evaluations through innovative pre45;training and optimization techniques. The pre45;training process of InternLM2 is meticulously detailed highlighting the preparation of diverse data types including text code and long45;context data. InternLM2 efficiently captures long45;term dependencies initially trained on 4k tokens before advancing to 32k tokens in pre45;training and fine45;tuning stages exhibiting remarkable performance on the 200k Needle45;in45;a45;Haystack test. InternLM2 is further aligned using Supervised Fine45;Tuning (SFT) and a novel Conditional Online Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (COOL RLHF) strategy that addresses conflicting human preferences and reward hacking. By releasing InternLM2 models in different training stages and model sizes we provide the community with insights into the models evolution.

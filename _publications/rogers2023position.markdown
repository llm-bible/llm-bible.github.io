Much of the recent discourse within the ML community has been centered around Large Language Models (LLMs) their functionality and potential -- yet not only do we not have a working definition of LLMs but much of this discourse relies on claims and assumptions that are worth re-examining. We contribute a definition of LLMs critically examine five common claims regarding their properties (including emergent properties) and conclude with suggestions for future research directions and their framing.

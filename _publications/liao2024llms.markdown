The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led many researchers to consider
their usage for scientific work. Some have found benefits using LLMs to augment
or automate aspects of their research pipeline, while others have urged caution
due to risks and ethical concerns. Yet little work has sought to quantify and
characterize how researchers use LLMs and why. We present the first large-scale
survey of 816 verified research article authors to understand how the research
community leverages and perceives LLMs as research tools. We examine
participants' self-reported LLM usage, finding that 81% of researchers have
already incorporated LLMs into different aspects of their research workflow. We
also find that traditionally disadvantaged groups in academia (non-White,
junior, and non-native English speaking researchers) report higher LLM usage
and perceived benefits, suggesting potential for improved research equity.
However, women, non-binary, and senior researchers have greater ethical
concerns, potentially hindering adoption.

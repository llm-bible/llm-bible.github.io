We investigate the use of multimodal information contained in images as an effective method for enhancing the commonsense of Transformer models for text generation. We perform experiments using BART and T5 on concept45;to45;text generation specifically the task of generative commonsense reasoning or CommonGen. We call our approach VisCTG Visually Grounded Concept45;to45;Text Generation. VisCTG involves captioning images representing appropriate everyday scenarios and using these captions to enrich and steer the generation process. Comprehensive evaluation and analysis demonstrate that VisCTG noticeably improves model performance while successfully addressing several issues of the baseline generations including poor commonsense fluency and specificity.

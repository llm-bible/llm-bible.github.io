We investigate the use of multimodal information contained in images as an
effective method for enhancing the commonsense of Transformer models for text
generation. We perform experiments using BART and T5 on concept-to-text
generation, specifically the task of generative commonsense reasoning, or
CommonGen. We call our approach VisCTG: Visually Grounded Concept-to-Text
Generation. VisCTG involves captioning images representing appropriate everyday
scenarios, and using these captions to enrich and steer the generation process.
Comprehensive evaluation and analysis demonstrate that VisCTG noticeably
improves model performance while successfully addressing several issues of the
baseline generations, including poor commonsense, fluency, and specificity.

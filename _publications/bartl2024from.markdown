Gender bias is not only prevalent in Large Language Models (LLMs) and their training data but also firmly ingrained into the structural aspects of language itself. Therefore adapting linguistic structures within LLM training data to promote gender45;inclusivity can make gender representations within the model more inclusive. The focus of our work are gender45;exclusive affixes in English such as in show45;girl or man45;cave which can perpetuate gender stereotypes and binary conceptions of gender. We use an LLM training dataset to compile a catalogue of 692 gender45;exclusive terms along with gender45;neutral variants and from this develop a gender45;inclusive fine45;tuning dataset the Tiny Heap. Fine45;tuning three different LLMs with this dataset we observe an overall reduction in gender45;stereotyping tendencies across the models. Our approach provides a practical method for enhancing gender inclusivity in LLM training data and contributes to incorporating queer45;feminist linguistic activism in bias mitigation research in NLP.

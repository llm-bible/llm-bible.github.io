Leveraging the autonomous decision-making capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) has demonstrated superior performance in reasoning tasks.
However, despite the success of iterative or recursive retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) techniques, these methods are often constrained to a single
solution space when confronted with complex problems. In this paper, we propose
a novel thinking pattern in RAG that integrates system analysis with efficient
reasoning actions, significantly activating intrinsic reasoning capabilities
and expanding the solution space of specific tasks via Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS), which we refer to as AirRAG. Specifically, our approach designs five
fundamental reasoning actions, which are expanded to a broad tree-based
reasoning space using MCTS. The approach also incorporates self-consistency
verification to explore potential reasoning paths and inference scaling law.
Additionally, computationally optimal strategies are employed to allocate more
inference resources to key actions, thereby enhancing overall performance.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AirRAG, showing
significant performance gains on complex question-answering datasets.
Furthermore, AirRAG is flexible and lightweight, making it easy to integrate
with other advanced technologies.

The assessment of advanced generative large language models (LLMs) poses a significant challenge given their heightened complexity in recent developments. Furthermore evaluating the performance of LLM-based applications in various industries as indicated by Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) is a complex undertaking. This task necessitates a profound understanding of industry use cases and the anticipated system behavior. Within the context of the automotive industry existing evaluation metrics prove inadequate for assessing in-car conversational question answering (ConvQA) systems. The unique demands of these systems where answers may relate to driver or car safety and are confined within the car domain highlight the limitations of current metrics. To address these challenges this paper introduces a set of KPIs tailored for evaluating the performance of in-car ConvQA systems along with datasets specifically designed for these KPIs. A preliminary and comprehensive empirical evaluation substantiates the efficacy of our proposed approach. Furthermore we investigate the impact of employing varied personas in prompts and found that it enhances the models capacity to simulate diverse viewpoints in assessments mirroring how individuals with different backgrounds perceive a topic.

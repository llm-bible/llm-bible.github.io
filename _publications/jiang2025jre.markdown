Science journalism reports current scientific discoveries to non-specialists,
aiming to enable public comprehension of the state of the art. This task is
challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented
research. We propose a JRE-L framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the
writing-reading-feedback-revision loop. In JRE-L, one LLM acts as the
journalist, another LLM as the general public reader, and the third LLM as an
editor. The journalist's writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the
reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by
leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs, we can
generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing
methods, including prompting single advanced models such as GPT-4 and other
LLM-collaboration strategies. Our code is publicly available at
github.com/Zzoay/JRE-L.

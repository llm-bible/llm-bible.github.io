In this study, we introduce CIKMar, an efficient approach to educational
dialogue systems powered by the Gemma Language model. By leveraging a
Dual-Encoder ranking system that incorporates both BERT and SBERT model, we
have designed CIKMar to deliver highly relevant and accurate responses, even
with the constraints of a smaller language model size. Our evaluation reveals
that CIKMar achieves a robust recall and F1-score of 0.70 using BERTScore
metrics. However, we have identified a significant challenge: the Dual-Encoder
tends to prioritize theoretical responses over practical ones. These findings
underscore the potential of compact and efficient models like Gemma in
democratizing access to advanced educational AI systems, ensuring effective and
contextually appropriate responses.

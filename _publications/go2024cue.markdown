The integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) has revolutionized information retrieval and expanded
the practical applications of AI. However, current systems struggle in
accurately interpreting user intent, employing diverse retrieval strategies,
and effectively filtering unintended or inappropriate responses, limiting their
effectiveness. This paper introduces Contextual Understanding and Enhanced
Search with MLLM (CUE-M), a novel multimodal search framework that addresses
these challenges through a multi-stage pipeline comprising image context
enrichment, intent refinement, contextual query generation, external API
integration, and relevance-based filtering. CUE-M incorporates a robust
filtering pipeline combining image-based, text-based, and multimodal
classifiers, dynamically adapting to instance- and category-specific concern
defined by organizational policies. Extensive experiments on real-word datasets
and public benchmarks on knowledge-based VQA and safety demonstrated that CUE-M
outperforms baselines and establishes new state-of-the-art results, advancing
the capabilities of multimodal retrieval systems.

We propose a novel alignment mechanism to deal with procedural reasoning on a newly released multimodal QA dataset named RecipeQA. Our model is solving the textual cloze task which is a reading comprehension on a recipe containing images and instructions. We exploit the power of attention networks cross-modal representations and a latent alignment space between instructions and candidate answers to solve the problem. We introduce constrained max-pooling which refines the max-pooling operation on the alignment matrix to impose disjoint constraints among the outputs of the model. Our evaluation result indicates a 1937; improvement over the baselines.

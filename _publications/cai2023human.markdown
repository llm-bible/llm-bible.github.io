While the emergence of powerful language models along with Chain-of-thought
prompting has made automation more and more omnipresent, it sometimes
demonstrates its weakness in long-term or multi-step logical reasoning. For
example, users don't always get desirable answers for complex mathematical
problems without human involvement. Against this background, we present the
Manual Correction System (MCS) -- a human-in-the-loop system enhanced by
Chain-of-Thought prompting, which explores how manual correction of sub-logics
in rationales can improve LLM's reasoning performance. Moving one step forward,
considering a system with human-in-the-loop involves more than having humans
improve performance but also controlling the cost. Therefore, we post a
Cost-utility Analysis Model for Human-in-the-Loop systems (CAMLOP) based on
classical economics theory to analyze, quantify and balance the utility and the
corresponding cost. We conduct experiments of MCS and CAMLOP with twelve
datasets. A significant advantage w.r.t cost and utility proves its superiority
over strong baselines.

This paper introduces a novel task to assess the faithfulness of large
language models (LLMs) using local perturbations and self-explanations. Many
LLMs often require additional context to answer certain questions correctly.
For this purpose, we propose a new efficient alternative explainability
technique, inspired by the commonly used leave-one-out approach. Using this
approach, we identify the sufficient and necessary parts for the LLM to
generate correct answers, serving as explanations. We propose a metric for
assessing faithfulness that compares these crucial parts with the
self-explanations of the model. Using the Natural Questions dataset, we
validate our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in explaining model
decisions and assessing faithfulness.

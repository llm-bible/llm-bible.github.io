Recent advancements in Large Vision45;Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in tackling complex multimodal tasks. Among these cutting45;edge developments Googles Bard stands out for its remarkable multimodal capabilities promoting comprehensive comprehension and reasoning across various domains. This work presents an early and holistic evaluation of LVLMs multimodal abilities with a particular focus on Bard by proposing a lightweight variant of LVLM45;eHub named Tiny LVLM45;eHub. In comparison to the vanilla version Tiny LVLM45;eHub possesses several appealing properties. Firstly it provides a systematic assessment of six categories of multimodal capabilities including visual perception visual knowledge acquisition visual reasoning visual commonsense object hallucination and embodied intelligence through quantitative evaluation of 42 standard text45;related visual benchmarks. Secondly it conducts an in45;depth analysis of LVLMs predictions using the ChatGPT Ensemble Evaluation (CEE) which leads to a robust and accurate evaluation and exhibits improved alignment with human evaluation compared to the word matching approach. Thirdly it comprises a mere 2.1K image45;text pairs facilitating ease of use for practitioners to evaluate their own offline LVLMs. Through extensive experimental analysis this study demonstrates that Bard outperforms previous LVLMs in most multimodal capabilities except object hallucination to which Bard is still susceptible. Tiny LVLM45;eHub serves as a baseline evaluation for various LVLMs and encourages innovative strategies aimed at advancing multimodal techniques.

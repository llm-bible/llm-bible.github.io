Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
generating psychotherapeutic dialogues, particularly in the context of
motivational interviewing (MI). However, the inherent lack of transparency in
LLM outputs presents significant challenges given the sensitive nature of
psychotherapy. Applying MI strategies, a set of MI skills, to generate more
controllable therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability provides a
possible solution. In this work, we explore the alignment of LLMs with MI
strategies by first prompting the LLMs to predict the appropriate strategies as
reasoning and then utilizing these strategies to guide the subsequent dialogue
generation. We seek to investigate whether such alignment leads to more
controllable and explainable generations. Multiple experiments including
automatic and human evaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of
MI strategies in aligning psychotherapy dialogue generation. Our findings
demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned dialogues
and suggest directions for practical applications in psychotherapeutic
settings.

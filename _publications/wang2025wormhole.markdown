In view of the gap in the current large language model in sharing memory
across dialogues, this research proposes a wormhole memory module (WMM) to
realize memory as a Rubik's cube that can be arbitrarily retrieved between
different dialogues. Through simulation experiments, the researcher built an
experimental framework based on the Python environment and used setting memory
barriers to simulate the current situation where memories between LLMs
dialogues are difficult to share. The CoQA development data set was imported
into the experiment, and the feasibility of its cross-dialogue memory retrieval
function was verified for WMM's nonlinear indexing and dynamic retrieval, and a
comparative analysis was conducted with the capabilities of Titans and MemGPT
memory modules. Experimental results show that WMM demonstrated the ability to
retrieve memory across dialogues and the stability of quantitative indicators
in eight experiments. It contributes new technical approaches to the
optimization of memory management of LLMs and provides experience for the
practical application in the future.

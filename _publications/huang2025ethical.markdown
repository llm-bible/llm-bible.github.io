[Context] Generative AI technologies, particularly Large Language Models
(LLMs), have transformed numerous domains by enhancing convenience and
efficiency in information retrieval, content generation, and decision-making
processes. However, deploying LLMs also presents diverse ethical challenges,
and their mitigation strategies remain complex and domain-dependent.
[Objective] This paper aims to identify and categorize the key ethical concerns
associated with using LLMs, examine existing mitigation strategies, and assess
the outstanding challenges in implementing these strategies across various
domains. [Method] We conducted a systematic mapping study, reviewing 39 studies
that discuss ethical concerns and mitigation strategies related to LLMs. We
analyzed these ethical concerns using five ethical dimensions that we extracted
based on various existing guidelines, frameworks, and an analysis of the
mitigation strategies and implementation challenges. [Results] Our findings
reveal that ethical concerns in LLMs are multi-dimensional and
context-dependent. While proposed mitigation strategies address some of these
concerns, significant challenges still remain. [Conclusion] Our results
highlight that ethical issues often hinder the practical implementation of the
mitigation strategies, particularly in high-stake areas like healthcare and
public governance; existing frameworks often lack adaptability, failing to
accommodate evolving societal expectations and diverse contexts.

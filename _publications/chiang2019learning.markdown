With the increasing research interest in dialogue response generation there is an emerging branch formulating this task as selecting next sentences where given the partial dialogue contexts the goal is to determine the most probable next sentence. Following the recent success of the Transformer model this paper proposes (1) a new variant of attention mechanism based on multi45;head attention called highway attention and (2) a recurrent model based on transformer and the proposed highway attention so45;called Highway Recurrent Transformer. Experiments on the response selection task in the seventh Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC7) show the capability of the proposed model of modeling both utterance45;level and dialogue45;level information; the effectiveness of each module is further analyzed as well.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) heralds a pivotal shift in online user interactions with information. Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) systems primarily relied on query45;document matching whereas LLMs excel in comprehending and generating human45;like text thereby enriching the IR experience significantly. While LLMs are often associated with chatbot functionalities this paper extends the discussion to their explicit application in information retrieval. We explore methodologies to optimize the retrieval process select optimal models and effectively scale and orchestrate LLMs aiming for cost45;efficiency and enhanced result accuracy. A notable challenge model hallucination45;where the model yields inaccurate or misinterpreted data45;is addressed alongside other model45;specific hurdles. Our discourse extends to crucial considerations including user privacy data optimization and the necessity for system clarity and interpretability. Through a comprehensive examination we unveil not only innovative strategies for integrating Language Models (LLMs) with Information Retrieval (IR) systems but also the consequential considerations that underline the need for a balanced approach aligned with user45;centric principles.

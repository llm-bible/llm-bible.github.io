Zero45;shot dialogue understanding aims to enable dialogue to track the users needs without any training data which has gained increasing attention. In this work we investigate the understanding ability of ChatGPT for zero45;shot dialogue understanding tasks including spoken language understanding (SLU) and dialogue state tracking (DST). Experimental results on four popular benchmarks reveal the great potential of ChatGPT for zero45;shot dialogue understanding. In addition extensive analysis shows that ChatGPT benefits from the multi45;turn interactive prompt in the DST task but struggles to perform slot filling for SLU. Finally we summarize several unexpected behaviors of ChatGPT in dialogue understanding tasks hoping to provide some insights for future research on building zero45;shot dialogue understanding systems with Large Language Models (LLMs).

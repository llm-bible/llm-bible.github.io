We present Step-Back Prompting, a simple prompting technique that enables
LLMs to do abstractions to derive high-level concepts and first principles from
instances containing specific details. Using the concepts and principles to
guide reasoning, LLMs significantly improve their abilities in following a
correct reasoning path towards the solution. We conduct experiments of
Step-Back Prompting with PaLM-2L, GPT-4 and Llama2-70B models, and observe
substantial performance gains on various challenging reasoning-intensive tasks
including STEM, Knowledge QA, and Multi-Hop Reasoning. For instance, Step-Back
Prompting improves PaLM-2L performance on MMLU (Physics and Chemistry) by 7%
and 11% respectively, TimeQA by 27%, and MuSiQue by 7%.

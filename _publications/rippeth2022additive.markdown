Additive interventions are a recently45;proposed mechanism for controlling target45;side attributes in neural machine translation. In contrast to tag45;based approaches which manipulate the raw source sequence interventions work by directly modulating the encoder representation of all tokens in the sequence. We examine the role of additive interventions in a large45;scale multi45;domain machine translation setting and compare its performance in various inference scenarios. We find that while the performance difference is small between intervention45;based systems and tag45;based systems when the domain label matches the test domain intervention45;based systems are robust to label error making them an attractive choice under label uncertainty. Further we find that the superiority of single45;domain fine45;tuning comes under question when training data size is scaled contradicting previous findings.

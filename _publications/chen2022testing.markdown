Generated texts from large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit a variety of harmful human45;like biases against various demographics. These findings motivate research efforts aiming to understand and measure such effects. Prior works have proposed benchmarks for identifying and techniques for mitigating these stereotypical associations. However as recent research pointed out existing benchmarks lack a robust experimental setup hindering the inference of meaningful conclusions from their evaluation metrics. In this paper we introduce a list of desiderata for robustly measuring biases in generative language models. Building upon these design principles we propose a benchmark called OCCUGENDER with a bias45;measuring procedure to investigate occupational gender bias. We then use this benchmark to test several state45;of45;the45;art open45;source LLMs including Llama Mistral and their instruction45;tuned versions. The results show that these models exhibit substantial occupational gender bias. We further propose prompting techniques to mitigate these biases without requiring fine45;tuning. Finally we validate the effectiveness of our methods through experiments on the same set of models.

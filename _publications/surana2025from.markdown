Conversational recommender systems (CRS) typically require extensive
domain-specific conversational datasets, yet high costs, privacy concerns, and
data-collection challenges severely limit their availability. Although Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong zero-shot recommendation
capabilities, practical applications often favor smaller, internally managed
recommender models due to scalability, interpretability, and data privacy
constraints, especially in sensitive or rapidly evolving domains. However,
training these smaller models effectively still demands substantial
domain-specific conversational data, which remains challenging to obtain. To
address these limitations, we propose an active data augmentation framework
that synthesizes conversational training data by leveraging black-box LLMs
guided by active learning techniques. Specifically, our method utilizes
publicly available non-conversational domain data, including item metadata,
user reviews, and collaborative signals, as seed inputs. By employing active
learning strategies to select the most informative seed samples, our approach
efficiently guides LLMs to generate synthetic, semantically coherent
conversational interactions tailored explicitly to the target domain. Extensive
experiments validate that conversational data generated by our proposed
framework significantly improves the performance of LLM-based CRS models,
effectively addressing the challenges of building CRS in no- or low-resource
scenarios.

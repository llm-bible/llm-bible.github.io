Drawing upon the intuition that aligning different modalities to the same semantic embedding space would allow models to understand states and actions more easily we propose a new perspective to the offline reinforcement learning (RL) challenge. More concretely we transform it into a supervised learning task by integrating multimodal and pre-trained language models. Our approach incorporates state information derived from images and action-related data obtained from text thereby bolstering RL training performance and promoting long-term strategic thinking. We emphasize the contextual understanding of language and demonstrate how decision-making in RL can benefit from aligning states and actions representation with languages representation. Our method significantly outperforms current baselines as evidenced by evaluations conducted on Atari and OpenAI Gym environments. This contributes to advancing offline RL performance and efficiency while providing a novel perspective on offline RL.Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Zheng0428/MORE\_."

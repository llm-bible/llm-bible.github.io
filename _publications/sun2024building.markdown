The incorporation of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the GPT series into diverse sectors including healthcare education and finance marks a significant evolution in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). The increasing demand for personalised applications motivated the design of conversational agents (CAs) to possess distinct personas. This paper commences by examining the rationale and implications of imbuing CAs with unique personas smoothly transitioning into a broader discussion of the personalisation and anthropomorphism of CAs based on LLMs in the LLM era. We delve into the specific applications where the implementation of a persona is not just beneficial but critical for LLM-based CAs. The paper underscores the necessity of a nuanced approach to persona integration highlighting the potential challenges and ethical dilemmas that may arise. Attention is directed towards the importance of maintaining persona consistency establishing robust evaluation mechanisms and ensuring that the persona attributes are effectively complemented by domain-specific knowledge.

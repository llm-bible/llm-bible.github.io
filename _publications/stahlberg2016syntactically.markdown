We investigate the use of hierarchical phrase45;based SMT lattices in end45;to45;end neural machine translation (NMT). Weight pushing transforms the Hiero scores for complete translation hypotheses with the full translation grammar score and full n45;gram language model score into posteriors compatible with NMT predictive probabilities. With a slightly modified NMT beam45;search decoder we find gains over both Hiero and NMT decoding alone with practical advantages in extending NMT to very large input and output vocabularies.

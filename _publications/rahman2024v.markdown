In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI research and application Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative force adept at interpreting and integrating information from diverse modalities such as text images and Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Despite these advancements the nuanced interaction and understanding of GUIs pose a significant challenge limiting the potential of existing models to enhance automation levels. To bridge this gap this paper presents V-Zen an innovative Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) meticulously crafted to revolutionise the domain of GUI understanding and grounding. Equipped with dual-resolution image encoders V-Zen establishes new benchmarks in efficient grounding and next-action prediction thereby laying the groundwork for self-operating computer systems. Complementing V-Zen is the GUIDE dataset an extensive collection of real-world GUI elements and task-based sequences serving as a catalyst for specialised fine-tuning. The successful integration of V-Zen and GUIDE marks the dawn of a new era in multimodal AI research opening the door to intelligent autonomous computing experiences. This paper extends an invitation to the research community to join this exciting journey shaping the future of GUI automation. In the spirit of open science our code data and model will be made publicly available paving the way for multimodal dialogue scenarios with intricate and precise interactions.

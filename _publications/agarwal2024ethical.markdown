Ethical reasoning is a crucial skill for Large Language Models (LLMs). However moral values are not universal but rather influenced by language and culture. This paper explores how three prominent LLMs -- GPT-4 ChatGPT and Llama2-70B-Chat -- perform ethical reasoning in different languages and if their moral judgement depend on the language in which they are prompted. We extend the study of ethical reasoning of LLMs by Rao et al. (2023) to a multilingual setup following their framework of probing LLMs with ethical dilemmas and policies from three branches of normative ethics deontology virtue and consequentialism. We experiment with six languages English Spanish Russian Chinese Hindi and Swahili. We find that GPT-4 is the most consistent and unbiased ethical reasoner across languages while ChatGPT and Llama2-70B-Chat show significant moral value bias when we move to languages other than English. Interestingly the nature of this bias significantly vary across languages for all LLMs including GPT-4.

The research field of end-user programming has largely been concerned with
helping non-experts learn to code sufficiently well in order to achieve their
tasks. Generative AI stands to obviate this entirely by allowing users to
generate code from naturalistic language prompts. In this essay, we explore the
extent to which "traditional" programming languages remain relevant for
non-expert end-user programmers in a world with generative AI. We posit the
"generative shift hypothesis": that generative AI will create qualitative and
quantitative expansions in the traditional scope of end-user programming. We
outline some reasons that traditional programming languages may still be
relevant and useful for end-user programmers. We speculate whether each of
these reasons might be fundamental and enduring, or whether they may disappear
with further improvements and innovations in generative AI. Finally, we
articulate a set of implications for end-user programming research, including
the possibility of needing to revisit many well-established core concepts, such
as Ko's learning barriers and Blackwell's attention investment model.

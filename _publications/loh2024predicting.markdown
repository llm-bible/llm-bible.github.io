We investigate Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to predict a user's
stance on a target given a collection of his/her target-agnostic social media
posts (i.e., user-level stance prediction). While we show early evidence that
LLMs are capable of this task, we highlight considerable variability in the
performance of the model across (i) the type of stance target, (ii) the
prediction strategy and (iii) the number of target-agnostic posts supplied.
Post-hoc analyses further hint at the usefulness of target-agnostic posts in
providing relevant information to LLMs through the presence of both
surface-level (e.g., target-relevant keywords) and user-level features (e.g.,
encoding users' moral values). Overall, our findings suggest that LLMs might
offer a viable method for determining public stances towards new topics based
on historical and target-agnostic data. At the same time, we also call for
further research to better understand LLMs' strong performance on the stance
prediction task and how their effectiveness varies across task contexts.

This paper provides a primer on Large Language Models (LLMs) and identifies
their strengths, limitations, applications and research directions. It is
intended to be useful to those in academia and industry who are interested in
gaining an understanding of the key LLM concepts and technologies, and in
utilising this knowledge in both day to day tasks and in more complex scenarios
where this technology can enhance current practices and processes.

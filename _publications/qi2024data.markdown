This study addresses the interaction challenges encountered by spoken dialogue systems (SDSs) when engaging with users who exhibit distinct conversational behaviors particularly minors in scenarios where data are scarce. We propose a novel data augmentation framework to enhance SDS performance for user groups with limited resources. Our approach leverages a large language model (LLM) to extract speaker styles and a pre-trained language model (PLM) to simulate dialogue act history. This method generates enriched and personalized dialogue data facilitating improved interactions with unique user demographics. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our methodology highlighting its potential to foster the development of more adaptive and inclusive dialogue systems.

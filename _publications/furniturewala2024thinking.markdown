Existing debiasing techniques are typically training-based or require access to the models internals and output distributions so they are inaccessible to end-users looking to adapt LLM outputs for their particular needs. In this study we examine whether structured prompting techniques can offer opportunities for fair text generation. We evaluate a comprehensive end-user-focused iterative framework of debiasing that applies System 2 thinking processes for prompts to induce logical reflective and critical text generation with single multi-step instruction and role-based variants. By systematically evaluating many LLMs across many datasets and different prompting strategies we show that the more complex System 2-based Implicative Prompts significantly improve over other techniques demonstrating lower mean bias in the outputs with competitive performance on the downstream tasks. Our work offers research directions for the design and the potential of end-user-focused evaluative frameworks for LLM use.

Auto45;GPT is an autonomous agent that leverages recent advancements in adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for decision45;making tasks. While there has been a growing interest in Auto45;GPT stypled agents questions remain regarding the effectiveness and flexibility of Auto45;GPT in solving real45;world decision45;making tasks. Its limited capability for real45;world engagement and the absence of benchmarks contribute to these uncertainties. In this paper we present a comprehensive benchmark study of Auto45;GPT styled agents in decision45;making tasks that simulate real45;world scenarios. Our aim is to gain deeper insights into this problem and understand the adaptability of GPT45;based agents. We compare the performance of popular LLMs such as GPT45;4 GPT45;3.5 Claude and Vicuna in Auto45;GPT styled decision45;making tasks. Furthermore we introduce the Additional Opinions algorithm an easy and effective method that incorporates supervised/imitation45;based learners into the Auto45;GPT scheme. This approach enables lightweight supervised learning without requiring fine45;tuning of the foundational LLMs. We demonstrate through careful baseline comparisons and ablation studies that the Additional Opinions algorithm significantly enhances performance in online decision45;making benchmarks including WebShop and ALFWorld.

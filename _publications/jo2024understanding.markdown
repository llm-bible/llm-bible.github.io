Recent large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to support public health monitoring by facilitating health disclosure through open45;ended conversations but rarely preserve the knowledge gained about individuals across repeated interactions. Augmenting LLMs with long45;term memory (LTM) presents an opportunity to improve engagement and self45;disclosure but we lack an understanding of how LTM impacts peoples interaction with LLM45;driven chatbots in public health interventions. We examine the case of CareCall 45;45; an LLM45;driven voice chatbot with LTM 45;45; through the analysis of 1252 call logs and interviews with nine users. We found that LTM enhanced health disclosure and fostered positive perceptions of the chatbot by offering familiarity. However we also observed challenges in promoting self45;disclosure through LTM particularly around addressing chronic health conditions and privacy concerns. We discuss considerations for LTM integration in LLM45;driven chatbots for public health monitoring including carefully deciding what topics need to be remembered in light of public health goals.

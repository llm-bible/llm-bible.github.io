We present a large-scale evaluation of 30 cognitive biases in 20
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) under various decision-making
scenarios. Our contributions include a novel general-purpose test framework for
reliable and large-scale generation of tests for LLMs, a benchmark dataset with
30,000 tests for detecting cognitive biases in LLMs, and a comprehensive
assessment of the biases found in the 20 evaluated LLMs. Our work confirms and
broadens previous findings suggesting the presence of cognitive biases in LLMs
by reporting evidence of all 30 tested biases in at least some of the 20 LLMs.
We publish our framework code to encourage future research on biases in LLMs:

This paper introduces UniTranslator, a visionary framework that re-imagines
code translation as a collaborative endeavor among multiple, compact LLMs. By
orchestrating the interaction of specialized agents, each focused on different
aspects of the translation process and grounded in a deep understanding of
programming concepts, UniTranslator achieves a level of accuracy and efficiency
that rivals larger, monolithic models. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates
the potential of UniTranslator to overcome the limitations of existing
approaches and unlock the power of smaller LLMs for complex code translation
tasks. We explore the effectiveness of this dynamic multi-agent paradigm in
handling diverse language pairs, including low-resource languages, and in
mitigating common issues such as code artifacts and hallucinations through the
use of Natural Language Inference (NLI) grounding and iterative feedback
mechanisms

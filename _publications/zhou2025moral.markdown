In this paper, we introduce the Multilingual Moral Reasoning Benchmark (MMRB)
to evaluate the moral reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs)
across five typologically diverse languages and three levels of contextual
complexity: sentence, paragraph, and document. Our results show moral reasoning
performance degrades with increasing context complexity, particularly for
low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. We further fine-tune the open-source
LLaMA-3-8B model using curated monolingual data for alignment and poisoning.
Surprisingly, low-resource languages have a stronger impact on multilingual
reasoning than high-resource ones, highlighting their critical role in
multilingual NLP.

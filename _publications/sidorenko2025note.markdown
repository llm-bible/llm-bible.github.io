Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in synthetic tabular data
generation, yet existing methods struggle to preserve complex feature
dependencies, particularly among categorical variables. This work introduces a
probability-driven prompting approach that leverages LLMs to estimate
conditional distributions, enabling more accurate and scalable data synthesis.
The results highlight the potential of prompting probability distributions to
enhance the statistical fidelity of LLM-generated tabular data.

Conversational modeling using Large Language Models (LLMs) requires a nuanced understanding of context to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. In this paper, we present Token Trails, a novel approach that leverages token-type embeddings to navigate the intricate contextual nuances within conversations. Our framework utilizes token-type embeddings to distinguish between user utterances and bot responses, facilitating the generation of context-aware replies. Through comprehensive experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Token Trails in improving conversational understanding and response generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our results highlight the significance of contextual modeling in conversational AI and underscore the promising potential of Token Trails to advance the field, paving the way for more sophisticated and contextually aware chatbot interactions.

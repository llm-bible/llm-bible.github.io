Dialogue systems including task45;oriented95;dialogue95;system (TOD) and open45;domain95;dialogue95;system (ODD) have undergone significant transformations with language95;models (LM) playing a central role. This survey delves into the historical trajectory of dialogue systems elucidating their intricate relationship with advancements in language models by categorizing this evolution into four distinct stages each marked by pivotal LM breakthroughs 1) Early95;Stage characterized by statistical LMs resulting in rule45;based or machine45;learning45;driven dialogue95;systems; 2) Independent development of TOD and ODD based on neural95;language95;models (NLM; e.g. LSTM and GRU) since NLMs lack intrinsic knowledge in their parameters; 3) fusion between different types of dialogue systems with the advert of pre45;trained95;language95;models (PLMs) starting from the fusion between four95;sub45;tasks95;within95;TOD and then TOD95;with95;ODD; and 4) current LLM45;based95;dialogue95;system wherein LLMs can be used to conduct TOD and ODD seamlessly. Thus our survey provides a chronological perspective aligned with LM breakthroughs offering a comprehensive review of state45;of45;the45;art research outcomes. Whats more we focus on emerging topics and discuss open challenges providing valuable insights into future directions for LLM45;based95;dialogue95;systems. Through this exploration we pave the way for a deeper95;comprehension of the evolution guiding future developments in LM45;based dialogue95;systems.

We present a method for augmenting a Large Language Model (LLM) with a
combination of text and visual data to enable accurate question answering in
visualization of scientific data, making conversational visualization possible.
LLMs struggle with tasks like visual data interaction, as they lack contextual
visual information. We address this problem by merging a text description of a
visualization and dataset with snapshots of the visualization. We extract their
essential features into a structured text file, highly compact, yet descriptive
enough to appropriately augment the LLM with contextual information, without
any fine-tuning. This approach can be applied to any visualization that is
already finally rendered, as long as it is associated with some textual
description.

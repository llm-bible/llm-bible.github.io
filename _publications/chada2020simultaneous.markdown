This paper describes the third place submission to the shared task on
simultaneous translation and paraphrasing for language education at the 4th
workshop on Neural Generation and Translation (WNGT) for ACL 2020. The final
system leverages pre-trained translation models and uses a Transformer
architecture combined with an oversampling strategy to achieve a competitive
performance. This system significantly outperforms the baseline on Hungarian
(27% absolute improvement in Weighted Macro F1 score) and Portuguese (33%
absolute improvement) languages.

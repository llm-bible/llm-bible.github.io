Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the development of
intelligent educational tools that support inquiry-based learning across
technical domains. In cybersecurity education, where accuracy and safety are
paramount, systems must go beyond surface-level relevance to provide
information that is both trustworthy and domain-appropriate. To address this
challenge, we introduce CyberBOT, a question-answering chatbot that leverages a
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to incorporate contextual
information from course-specific materials and validate responses using a
domain-specific cybersecurity ontology. The ontology serves as a structured
reasoning layer that constrains and verifies LLM-generated answers, reducing
the risk of misleading or unsafe guidance. CyberBOT has been deployed in a
large graduate-level course at Arizona State University (ASU), where more than
one hundred students actively engage with the system through a dedicated
web-based platform. Computational evaluations in lab environments highlight the
potential capacity of CyberBOT, and a forthcoming field study will evaluate its
pedagogical impact. By integrating structured domain reasoning with modern
generative capabilities, CyberBOT illustrates a promising direction for
developing reliable and curriculum-aligned AI applications in specialized
educational contexts.

In the current era a multitude of language models has emerged to cater to user inquiries. Notably the GPT-3.5 Turbo language model has gained substantial attention as the underlying technology for ChatGPT. Leveraging extensive parameters this model adeptly responds to a wide range of questions. However due to its reliance on internal knowledge the accuracy of responses may not be absolute. This article scrutinizes ChatGPT as a Question Answering System (QAS) comparing its performance to other existing QASs. The primary focus is on evaluating ChatGPTs proficiency in extracting responses from provided paragraphs a core QAS capability. Additionally performance comparisons are made in scenarios without a surrounding passage. Multiple experiments exploring response hallucination and considering question complexity were conducted on ChatGPT. Evaluation employed well-known Question Answering (QA) datasets including SQuAD NewsQA and PersianQuAD across English and Persian languages. Metrics such as F-score exact match and accuracy were employed in the assessment. The study reveals that while ChatGPT demonstrates competence as a generative model it is less effective in question answering compared to task-specific models. Providing context improves its performance and prompt engineering enhances precision particularly for questions lacking explicit answers in provided paragraphs. ChatGPT excels at simpler factual questions compared to how and why question types. The evaluation highlights occurrences of hallucinations where ChatGPT provides responses to questions without available answers in the provided context.

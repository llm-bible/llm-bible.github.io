Despite the considerable progress achieved in the long video generation
problem, there is still significant room to improve the consistency of the
videos, particularly in terms of smoothness and transitions between scenes. We
address these issues to enhance the consistency and coherence of videos
generated with either single or multiple prompts. We propose the Time-frequency
based temporal Attention Reweighting Algorithm (TiARA), which meticulously
edits the attention score matrix based on the Discrete Short-Time Fourier
Transform. Our method is supported by a theoretical guarantee, the
first-of-its-kind for frequency-based methods in diffusion models. For videos
generated by multiple prompts, we further investigate key factors affecting
prompt interpolation quality and propose PromptBlend, an advanced prompt
interpolation pipeline. The efficacy of our proposed method is validated via
extensive experimental results, exhibiting consistent and impressive
improvements over baseline methods. The code will be released upon acceptance.

This paper presents a performance comparison of three large language models (LLMs) namely OpenAI ChatGPT Microsoft Bing Chat (BingChat) and Google Bard on the VNHSGE English dataset. The performance of BingChat Bard and ChatGPT (GPT-3.5) is 92.437; 8637; and 79.237; respectively. The results show that BingChat is better than ChatGPT and Bard. Therefore BingChat and Bard can replace ChatGPT while ChatGPT is not yet officially available in Vietnam. The results also indicate that BingChat Bard and ChatGPT outperform Vietnamese students in English language proficiency. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the potential of LLMs in English language education. The remarkable performance of ChatGPT BingChat and Bard demonstrates their potential as effective tools for teaching and learning English at the high school level.

There has been significant research on propagandistic content detection
across different modalities and languages. However, most studies have primarily
focused on detection, with little attention given to explanations justifying
the predicted label. This is largely due to the lack of resources that provide
explanations alongside annotated labels. To address this issue, we propose a
multilingual (i.e., Arabic and English) explanation-enhanced dataset, the first
of its kind. Additionally, we introduce an explanation-enhanced LLM for both
label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings
indicate that the model performs comparably while also generating explanations.
We will make the dataset and experimental resources publicly available for the
research community.

Fine45;tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific domain tasks has achieved great success in Text45;to45;SQL tasks. However these fine45;tuned models often face challenges with multi45;turn Text45;to45;SQL tasks caused by ambiguous or unanswerable questions. It is desired to enhance LLMs to handle multiple types of questions in multi45;turn Text45;to45;SQL tasks. To address this we propose a novel data augmentation method called QDA45;SQL which generates multiple types of multi45;turn Qamp;A pairs by using LLMs. In QDA45;SQL we introduce a novel data augmentation method incorporating validation and correction mechanisms to handle complex multi45;turn Text45;to45;SQL tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that QDA45;SQL enables fine45;tuned models to exhibit higher performance on SQL statement accuracy and enhances their ability to handle complex unanswerable questions in multi45;turn Text45;to45;SQL tasks. The generation script and test set are released at https://github.com/mcxiaoxiao/QDA&#45;SQL.

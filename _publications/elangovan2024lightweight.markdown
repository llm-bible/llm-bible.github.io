Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a potential solution to assist digital health development with patient education commonly medication45;related enquires. We trained and validated Med45;Pal a medication domain45;specific LLM45;chatbot fine45;tuned with a fine45;grained and expert curated dataset from a selection of five light45;weighted open45;source LLMs of smaller parameter size (7 billion or less) regarding computational constraints and prioritizing operational efficiency. A multi45;disciplinary team performed a clinical evaluation of LLMs responses using the SCORE criteria focusing on safety accuracy bias reproducibility and ease of understanding. Best performing light45;weighted LLM was chosen as Med45;Pal for further engineering with guard45;railing using adversarial prompting. Med45;Pal and existing light45;weighted LLMs including pretrained Biomistral and finetuned Meerkat were validated on an independent dataset on a broad range of medication45;related questions (231 in total) 12 different question types across 14 different medication classes. Mistral45;7b emerged as the top performer among selected lightweight LLMs achieving the highest median score of 14 and 71.937; high45;quality responses in accuracy and safety domains hence chosen as the backbone LLM for Med45;Pal. When compared against Biomistral Med45;pal outperformed in generating responses appropriate for patient communication with significant reductions bias and errors typical of general LLMs. Comparable performance was observed when comparing Med45;Pal with Meerkat. Med45;Pal showcases the feasibility of developing and employing fine45;tuned light45;weighted LLMs to enhance digital health communications.

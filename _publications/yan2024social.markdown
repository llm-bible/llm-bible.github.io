Non45;cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well45;being and such skill development can be supported by narrative45;based (e.g. storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role45;playing storytelling little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non45;cognitive skills learning. Additionally the benefits of AI mentorship on self45;reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely underexplored. To this end we introduced Simulife++ an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists creating stories with one or multiple AI45;based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular we expanded the Human45;AI interaction to a Human45;AI45;AI collaboration by including a Sage Agent who acts as a bystander providing users with some perspectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of non45;cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within45;subject user study our quantitative results reveal that when accompanied by Sage Agent users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motivation self45;perceptions and resilience amp; coping along with an enhanced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally our qualitative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoting reflection on non45;cognitive skills enhancing social communication and decision45;making performance and improving overall user experience within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Agent and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future potential of Sage Agent for non45;cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.

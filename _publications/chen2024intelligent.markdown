This paper explores the application of prompt engineering to enhance the
performance of large language models (LLMs) in the domain of Traditional
Chinese Medicine (TCM). We propose TCM-Prompt, a framework that integrates
various pre-trained language models (PLMs), templates, tokenization, and
verbalization methods, allowing researchers to easily construct and fine-tune
models for specific TCM-related tasks. We conducted experiments on disease
classification, syndrome identification, herbal medicine recommendation, and
general NLP tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our
approach compared to baseline methods. Our findings suggest that prompt
engineering is a promising technique for improving the performance of LLMs in
specialized domains like TCM, with potential applications in digitalization,
modernization, and personalized medicine.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized
Conversational User Interfaces (CUIs), enabling more dynamic, context-aware,
and human-like interactions across diverse domains, from social sciences to
healthcare. However, the rapid adoption of LLM-based personas raises critical
ethical and practical concerns, including bias, manipulation, and unforeseen
social consequences. Unlike traditional CUIs, where personas are carefully
designed with clear intent, LLM-based personas generate responses dynamically
from vast datasets, making their behavior less predictable and harder to
govern. This workshop aims to bridge the gap between CUI and broader AI
communities by fostering a cross-disciplinary dialogue on the responsible
design and evaluation of LLM-based personas. Bringing together researchers,
designers, and practitioners, we will explore best practices, develop ethical
guidelines, and promote frameworks that ensure transparency, inclusivity, and
user-centered interactions. By addressing these challenges collaboratively, we
seek to shape the future of LLM-driven CUIs in ways that align with societal
values and expectations.

The integration of AI in education offers significant potential to enhance
learning efficiency. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and
Llama, allow students to query a wide range of topics, providing unprecedented
flexibility. However, LLMs face challenges, such as handling varying content
relevance and lack of personalization. To address these challenges, we propose
TutorLLM, a personalized learning recommender LLM system based on Knowledge
Tracing (KT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The novelty of TutorLLM
lies in its unique combination of KT and RAG techniques with LLMs, which
enables dynamic retrieval of context-specific knowledge and provides
personalized learning recommendations based on the student's personal learning
state. Specifically, this integration allows TutorLLM to tailor responses based
on individual learning states predicted by the Multi-Features with Latent
Relations BERT-based KT (MLFBK) model and to enhance response accuracy with a
Scraper model. The evaluation includes user assessment questionnaires and
performance metrics, demonstrating a 10% improvement in user satisfaction and a
5% increase in quiz scores compared to using general LLMs alone.

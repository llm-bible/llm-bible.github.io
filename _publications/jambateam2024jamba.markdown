We present Jamba-1.5, new instruction-tuned large language models based on
our Jamba architecture. Jamba is a hybrid Transformer-Mamba mixture of experts
architecture, providing high throughput and low memory usage across context
lengths, while retaining the same or better quality as Transformer models. We
release two model sizes: Jamba-1.5-Large, with 94B active parameters, and
Jamba-1.5-Mini, with 12B active parameters. Both models are fine-tuned for a
variety of conversational and instruction-following capabilties, and have an
effective context length of 256K tokens, the largest amongst open-weight
models. To support cost-effective inference, we introduce ExpertsInt8, a novel
quantization technique that allows fitting Jamba-1.5-Large on a machine with 8
80GB GPUs when processing 256K-token contexts without loss of quality. When
evaluated on a battery of academic and chatbot benchmarks, Jamba-1.5 models
achieve excellent results while providing high throughput and outperforming
other open-weight models on long-context benchmarks. The model weights for both
sizes are publicly available under the Jamba Open Model License and we release
ExpertsInt8 as open source.

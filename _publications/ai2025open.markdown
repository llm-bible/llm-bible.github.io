Accessing accurate medication insights is vital for enhancing patient safety,
minimizing errors, and supporting clinical decision-making. However, healthcare
professionals in Africa often rely on manual and time-consuming processes to
retrieve drug information, exacerbated by limited access to pharmacists due to
brain drain and healthcare disparities. This paper presents "Drug Insights," an
open-source Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to streamline
medication lookup for healthcare workers in Africa. By leveraging a corpus of
Nigerian pharmaceutical data and advanced AI technologies, including Pinecone
databases and GPT models, the system delivers accurate, context-specific
responses with minimal hallucination. The chatbot integrates prompt engineering
and S-BERT evaluation to optimize retrieval and response generation.
Preliminary tests, including pharmacist feedback, affirm the tool's potential
to improve drug information access while highlighting areas for enhancement,
such as UI/UX refinement and extended corpus integration.

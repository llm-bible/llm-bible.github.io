Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
valuable as decision-making tools in domains such as gaming and programming.
However, these agents often face challenges in achieving high-level goals
without detailed instructions and in adapting to environments where feedback is
delayed. In this paper, we present SelfGoal, a novel automatic approach
designed to enhance agents' capabilities to achieve high-level goals with
limited human prior and environmental feedback. The core concept of SelfGoal
involves adaptively breaking down a high-level goal into a tree structure of
more practical subgoals during the interaction with environments while
identifying the most useful subgoals and progressively updating this structure.
Experimental results demonstrate that SelfGoal significantly enhances the
performance of language agents across various tasks, including competitive,
cooperative, and deferred feedback environments. Project page:

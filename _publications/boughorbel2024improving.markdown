Training LLMs for low-resource languages usually utilizes data augmentation from English using machine translation (MT). This, however, brings a number of challenges to LLM training: there are large costs attached to translating and curating huge amounts of content with high-end machine translation solutions; the translated content carries over cultural biases; and if the translation is not faithful and accurate, data quality degrades causing issues in the trained model. In this work, we investigate the role of translation and synthetic data in training language models. We translate TinyStories, a dataset of 2.2M short stories for 3-4 year old children, from English to Arabic using the open NLLB-3B MT model. We train a number of story generation models of size 1M-33M parameters using this data. We identify a number of quality and task-specific issues in the resulting models. To rectify these issues, we further pre-train the models with a small dataset of synthesized high-quality Arabic stories generated by a capable LLM, representing 1&#37; of the original training data. We show, using GPT-4 as a judge and Dictionary Learning Analysis from mechanistic interpretability, that the suggested approach is a practical means to resolve some of the machine translation pitfalls. We illustrate the improvements through case studies of linguistic and cultural bias issues.

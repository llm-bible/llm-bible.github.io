This survey provides a comprehensive review of research on multi45;turn dialogue systems with a particular focus on multi45;turn dialogue systems based on large language models (LLMs). This paper aims to (a) give a summary of existing LLMs and approaches for adapting LLMs to downstream tasks; (b) elaborate recent advances in multi45;turn dialogue systems covering both LLM45;based open45;domain dialogue (ODD) and task45;oriented dialogue (TOD) systems along with datasets and evaluation metrics; (c) discuss some future emphasis and recent research problems arising from the development of LLMs and the increasing demands on multi45;turn dialogue systems.

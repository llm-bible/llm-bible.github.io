Unlike traditional educational chatbots that rely on pre-programmed
responses, large-language model-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate
remarkable versatility to serve as a dynamic resource for addressing student
needs from understanding advanced concepts to solving complex problems. This
work explores the impact of such technology on student learning in an
interdisciplinary, project-oriented data visualization course. Throughout the
semester, students engaged with ChatGPT across four distinct projects,
designing and implementing data visualizations using a variety of tools such as
Tableau, D3, and Vega-lite. We collected conversation logs and reflection
surveys after each assignment and conducted interviews with selected students
to gain deeper insights into their experiences with ChatGPT. Our analysis
examined the advantages and barriers of using ChatGPT, students' querying
behavior, the types of assistance sought, and its impact on assignment outcomes
and engagement. We discuss design considerations for an educational solution
tailored for data visualization education, extending beyond ChatGPT's basic
interface.

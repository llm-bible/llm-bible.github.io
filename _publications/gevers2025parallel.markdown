In this study, we take a closer look at how Winograd schema challenges can be
used to evaluate common sense reasoning in LLMs. Specifically, we evaluate
generative models of different sizes on the popular WinoGrande benchmark. We
release WinoWhat, a new corpus, in which each instance of the WinoGrande
validation set is paraphrased. Additionally, we evaluate the performance on the
challenge across five common sense knowledge categories, giving more
fine-grained insights on what types of knowledge are more challenging for LLMs.
Surprisingly, all models perform significantly worse on WinoWhat, implying that
LLM reasoning capabilities are overestimated on WinoGrande. To verify whether
this is an effect of benchmark memorization, we match benchmark instances to
LLM trainingdata and create two test-suites. We observe that memorization has a
minimal effect on model performance on WinoGrande.

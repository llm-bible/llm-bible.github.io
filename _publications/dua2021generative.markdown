Compositional reasoning tasks like multi45;hop question answering require making latent decisions to get the final answer given a question. However crowdsourced datasets often capture only a slice of the underlying task distribution which can induce unanticipated biases in models performing compositional reasoning. Furthermore discriminatively trained models exploit such biases to get a better held45;out performance without learning the right way to reason as they do not necessitate paying attention to the question representation (conditioning variable) in its entirety to estimate the answer likelihood. In this work we propose a generative context selection model for multi45;hop question answering that reasons about how the given question could have been generated given a context pair. While being comparable to the state45;of45;the45;art answering performance our proposed generative passage selection model has a better performance (4.937; higher than baseline) on adversarial held45;out set which tests robustness of models multi45;hop reasoning capabilities.

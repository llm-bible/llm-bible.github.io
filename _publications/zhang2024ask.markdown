The evolution of large language models (LLMs) has enhanced the planning capabilities of language agents in diverse real45;world scenarios. Despite these advancements the potential of LLM45;powered agents to comprehend ambiguous user instructions for reasoning and decision45;making is still under exploration. In this work we introduce a new task Proactive Agent Planning which requires language agents to predict clarification needs based on user45;agent conversation and agent45;environment interaction invoke external tools to collect valid information and generate a plan to fulfill the users demands. To study this practical problem we establish a new benchmark dataset Ask45;before45;Plan. To tackle the deficiency of LLMs in proactive planning we propose a novel multi45;agent framework Clarification45;Execution45;Planning (texttt123;CEP125;) which consists of three agents specialized in clarification execution and planning. We introduce the trajectory tuning scheme for the clarification agent and static execution agent as well as the memory recollection mechanism for the dynamic execution agent. Extensive evaluations and comprehensive analyses conducted on the Ask45;before45;Plan dataset validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

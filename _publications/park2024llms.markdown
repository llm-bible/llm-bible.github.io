Agricultural meteorological recommendations are crucial for enhancing crop productivity and sustainability by providing farmers with actionable insights based on weather forecasts soil conditions and crop-specific data. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to improve the accuracy and relevance of these recommendations. We designed a multi-round prompt framework to iteratively refine recommendations using updated data and feedback implemented on ChatGPT Claude2 and GPT-4. Our method was evaluated against baseline models and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach using manually collected datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance with our approach achieving up to 90 accuracy and high GPT-4 scores. Additional validation through real-world pilot studies further confirmed the practical benefits of our method highlighting its potential to transform agricultural practices and decision-making.

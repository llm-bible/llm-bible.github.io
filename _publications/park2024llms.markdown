Agricultural meteorological recommendations are crucial for enhancing crop
productivity and sustainability by providing farmers with actionable insights
based on weather forecasts, soil conditions, and crop-specific data. This paper
presents a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) and
prompt engineering to improve the accuracy and relevance of these
recommendations. We designed a multi-round prompt framework to iteratively
refine recommendations using updated data and feedback, implemented on ChatGPT,
Claude2, and GPT-4. Our method was evaluated against baseline models and a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approach using manually collected datasets. The results
demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and contextual relevance, with
our approach achieving up to 90% accuracy and high GPT-4 scores. Additional
validation through real-world pilot studies further confirmed the practical
benefits of our method, highlighting its potential to transform agricultural
practices and decision-making.

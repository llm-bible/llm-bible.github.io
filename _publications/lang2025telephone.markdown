Telephone surveys remain a valuable tool for gathering insights but typically
require substantial resources in training and coordinating human interviewers.
This work presents an AI-driven telephone survey system integrating
text-to-speech (TTS), a large language model (LLM), and speech-to-text (STT)
that mimics the versatility of human-led interviews (full-duplex dialogues) at
scale.
  We tested the system across two populations, a pilot study in the United
States (n = 75) and a large-scale deployment in Peru (n = 2,739), inviting
participants via web-based links and contacting them via direct phone calls.
The AI agent successfully administered open-ended and closed-ended questions,
handled basic clarifications, and dynamically navigated branching logic,
allowing fast large-scale survey deployment without interviewer recruitment or
training.
  Our findings demonstrate that while the AI system's probing for qualitative
depth was more limited than human interviewers, overall data quality approached
human-led standards for structured items. This study represents one of the
first successful large-scale deployments of an LLM-based telephone interviewer
in a real-world survey context. The AI-powered telephone survey system has the
potential for expanding scalable, consistent data collecting across market
research, social science, and public opinion studies, thus improving
operational efficiency while maintaining appropriate data quality for research.

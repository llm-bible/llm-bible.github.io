Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that have undergone extensive training using large datasets in order to understand and produce language that closely resembles that of humans. These models have reached a level of proficiency where they are capable of successfully completing university exams across several disciplines and generating functional code to handle novel problems. This research investigates the coding proficiency of ChatGPT 3.5 a LLM released by OpenAI in November 2022 which has gained significant recognition for its impressive text generating and code creation capabilities. The skill of the model in creating code snippets is evaluated across 10 various programming languages and 4 different software domains. Based on the findings derived from this research major unexpected behaviors and limitations of the model have been identified. This study aims to identify potential areas for development and examine the ramifications of automated code generation on the evolution of programming languages and on the tech industry.

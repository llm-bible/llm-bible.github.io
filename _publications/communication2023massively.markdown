What does it take to create the Babel Fish a tool that can help individuals translate speech between any two languages While recent breakthroughs in text45;based models have pushed machine translation coverage beyond 200 languages unified speech45;to45;speech translation models have yet to achieve similar strides. More specifically conventional speech45;to45;speech translation systems rely on cascaded systems that perform translation progressively putting high45;performing unified systems out of reach. To address these gaps we introduce SeamlessM4T a single model that supports speech45;to45;speech translation speech45;to45;text translation text45;to45;speech translation text45;to45;text translation and automatic speech recognition for up to 100 languages. To build this we used 1 million hours of open speech audio data to learn self45;supervised speech representations with w2v45;BERT 2.0. Subsequently we created a multimodal corpus of automatically aligned speech translations. Filtered and combined with human45;labeled and pseudo45;labeled data we developed the first multilingual system capable of translating from and into English for both speech and text. On FLEURS SeamlessM4T sets a new standard for translations into multiple target languages achieving an improvement of 2037; BLEU over the previous SOTA in direct speech45;to45;text translation. Compared to strong cascaded models SeamlessM4T improves the quality of into45;English translation by 1.3 BLEU points in speech45;to45;text and by 2.6 ASR45;BLEU points in speech45;to45;speech. Tested for robustness our system performs better against background noises and speaker variations in speech45;to45;text tasks compared to the current SOTA model. Critically we evaluated SeamlessM4T on gender bias and added toxicity to assess translation safety.

Machine learning research, crucial for technological advancements and
innovation, often faces significant challenges due to its inherent complexity,
slow pace of experimentation, and the necessity for specialized expertise.
Motivated by this, we present a new systematic framework, autonomous Machine
Learning Research with large language models (MLR-Copilot), designed to enhance
machine learning research productivity through the automatic generation and
implementation of research ideas using Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The
framework consists of three phases: research idea generation, experiment
implementation, and implementation execution. First, existing research papers
are used to generate hypotheses and experimental plans vis IdeaAgent powered by
LLMs. Next, the implementation generation phase translates these plans into
executables with ExperimentAgent. This phase leverages retrieved prototype code
and optionally retrieves candidate models and data. Finally, the execution
phase, also managed by ExperimentAgent, involves running experiments with
mechanisms for human feedback and iterative debugging to enhance the likelihood
of achieving executable research outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five
machine learning research tasks and the experimental results show the
framework's potential to facilitate the research progress and innovations.

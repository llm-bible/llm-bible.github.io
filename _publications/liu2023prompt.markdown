In the evolving field of personalized news recommendation understanding the semantics of the underlying data is crucial. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT45;4 have shown promising performance in understanding natural language. However the extent of their applicability in news recommendation systems remains to be validated. This paper introduces RecPrompt the first framework for news recommendation that leverages the capabilities of LLMs through prompt engineering. This system incorporates a prompt optimizer that applies an iterative bootstrapping process enhancing the LLM45;based recommenders ability to align news content with user preferences and interests more effectively. Moreover this study offers insights into the effective use of LLMs in news recommendation emphasizing both the advantages and the challenges of incorporating LLMs into recommendation systems.

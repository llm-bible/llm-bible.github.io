Recent advancements in natural language processing particularly with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have significantly enhanced dialogue systems enabling them to generate more natural and fluent conversations. Despite these improvements challenges persist such as managing continuous dialogues memory retention and minimizing hallucinations. The AIWolfDial2024 addresses these challenges by employing the Werewolf Game an incomplete information game to test the capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive environments. This paper introduces a LLM-based Werewolf Game AI where each role is supported by situation analysis to aid response generation. Additionally for the werewolf role various persuasion strategies including logical appeal credibility appeal and emotional appeal are employed to effectively persuade other players to align with its actions.

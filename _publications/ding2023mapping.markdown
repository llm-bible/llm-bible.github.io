Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities prompting us to reconsider the future of human45;AI co45;creation and how humans interact with LLMs. In this paper we present a spectrum of content generation tasks and their corresponding human45;AI interaction patterns. These tasks include 1) fixed45;scope content curation tasks with minimal human45;AI interactions 2) independent creative tasks with precise human45;AI interactions and 3) complex and interdependent creative tasks with iterative human45;AI interactions. We encourage the generative AI and HCI research communities to focus on the more complex and interdependent tasks which require greater levels of human involvement.

Despite their empirical success, neural networks still have difficulty
capturing compositional aspects of natural language. This work proposes a
simple data augmentation approach to encourage compositional behavior in neural
models for sequence-to-sequence problems. Our approach, SeqMix, creates new
synthetic examples by softly combining input/output sequences from the training
set. We connect this approach to existing techniques such as SwitchOut and word
dropout, and show that these techniques are all approximating variants of a
single objective. SeqMix consistently yields approximately 1.0 BLEU improvement
on five different translation datasets over strong Transformer baselines. On
tasks that require strong compositional generalization such as SCAN and
semantic parsing, SeqMix also offers further improvements.

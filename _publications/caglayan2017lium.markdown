This paper describes the monomodal and multimodal Neural Machine Translation
systems developed by LIUM and CVC for WMT17 Shared Task on Multimodal
Translation. We mainly explored two multimodal architectures where either
global visual features or convolutional feature maps are integrated in order to
benefit from visual context. Our final systems ranked first for both En-De and
En-Fr language pairs according to the automatic evaluation metrics METEOR and
BLEU.

This report presents a study on the emotional dialogue capability of ChatGPT an advanced language model developed by OpenAI. The study evaluates the performance of ChatGPT on emotional dialogue understanding and generation through a series of experiments on several downstream tasks. Our findings indicate that while ChatGPTs performance on emotional dialogue understanding may still lag behind that of supervised models it exhibits promising results in generating emotional responses. Furthermore the study suggests potential avenues for future research directions.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their In45;Context Learning (ICL) capabilities enabling few45;shot learning without the need for gradient updates. Despite its advantages the effectiveness of ICL heavily depends on the choice of demonstrations. Selecting the most effective demonstrations for ICL remains a significant research challenge. To tackle this issue we propose a demonstration selection method named InfICL which utilizes influence functions to analyze impacts of training samples. By identifying the most influential training samples as demonstrations InfICL aims to enhance the ICL generalization performance. To keep InfICL cost45;effective we only use the LLM to generate sample input embeddings avoiding expensive fine45;tuning. Through empirical studies on various real45;world datasets we demonstrate advantages of InfICL compared to state45;of45;the45;art baselines.

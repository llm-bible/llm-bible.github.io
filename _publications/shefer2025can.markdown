Although formal methods are capable of producing reliable software, they have
seen minimal adoption in everyday programming. Automatic code generation using
large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely
considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore
the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages
(Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived
from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types
of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.

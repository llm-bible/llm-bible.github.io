The Test and Measurement domain, known for its strict requirements for
accuracy and efficiency, is increasingly adopting Generative AI technologies to
enhance the performance of data analysis, automation, and decision-making
processes. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise
for advancing automation and precision in testing. However, the evaluation of
LLMs in this specialized area remains insufficiently explored. To address this
gap, we introduce the Test and Measurement Intelligence Quotient (TMIQ), a
benchmark designed to quantitatively assess LLMs across a wide range of
electronic engineering tasks. TMIQ offers a comprehensive set of scenarios and
metrics for detailed evaluation, including SCPI command matching accuracy,
ranked response evaluation, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT), and the impact of
output formatting variations required by LLMs on performance. In testing
various LLMs, our findings indicate varying levels of proficiency, with exact
SCPI command match accuracy ranging from around 56% to 73%, and ranked matching
first-position scores achieving around 33% for the best-performing model. We
also assess token usage, cost-efficiency, and response times, identifying
trade-offs between accuracy and operational efficiency. Additionally, we
present a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate
datasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs.
TMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs
for production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying
strengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections
for applications within the Test and Measurement industry.

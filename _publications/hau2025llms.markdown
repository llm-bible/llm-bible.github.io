The integration of AI techniques has become increasingly popular in software
development, enhancing performance, usability, and the availability of
intelligent features. With the rise of large language models (LLMs) and
generative AI, developers now have access to a wealth of high-quality
open-source models and APIs from closed-source providers, enabling easier
experimentation and integration of LLMs into various systems. This has also
opened new possibilities in mobile application (app) development, allowing for
more personalized and intelligent apps. However, integrating LLM into mobile
apps might present unique challenges for developers, particularly regarding
mobile device constraints, API management, and code infrastructure. In this
project, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 149 LLM-enabled Android apps
and conducted an exploratory analysis to understand how LLMs are deployed and
used within mobile apps. This analysis highlights key characteristics of the
dataset, prevalent integration strategies, and common challenges developers
face. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research and tooling
development aimed at enhancing LLM-enabled mobile apps.

This study examines the efficacy of two SOTA large language models (LLMs),
namely ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing Chat (BingChat), in catering to the needs of
Vietnamese students. Although ChatGPT exhibits proficiency in multiple
disciplines, Bing Chat emerges as the more advantageous option. We conduct a
comparative analysis of their academic achievements in various disciplines,
encompassing mathematics, literature, English language, physics, chemistry,
biology, history, geography, and civic education. The results of our study
suggest that BingChat demonstrates superior performance compared to ChatGPT
across a wide range of subjects, with the exception of literature, where
ChatGPT exhibits better performance. Additionally, BingChat utilizes the more
advanced GPT-4 technology in contrast to ChatGPT, which is built upon GPT-3.5.
This allows BingChat to improve to comprehension, reasoning and generation of
creative and informative text. Moreover, the fact that BingChat is accessible
in Vietnam and its integration of hyperlinks and citations within responses
serve to reinforce its superiority. In our analysis, it is evident that while
ChatGPT exhibits praiseworthy qualities, BingChat presents a more apdated
solutions for Vietnamese students.

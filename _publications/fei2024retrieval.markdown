Current Large Language Models (LLMs) face inherent limitations due to their pre45;defined context lengths which impede their capacity for multi45;hop reasoning within extensive textual contexts. While existing techniques like Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) have attempted to bridge this gap by sourcing external information they fall short when direct answers are not readily available. We introduce a novel approach that re45;imagines information retrieval through dynamic in45;context editing inspired by recent breakthroughs in knowledge editing. By treating lengthy contexts as malleable external knowledge our method interactively gathers and integrates relevant information thereby enabling LLMs to perform sophisticated reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively empowers context45;limited LLMs such as Llama2 to engage in multi45;hop reasoning with improved performance which outperforms state45;of45;the45;art context window extrapolation methods and even compares favorably to more advanced commercial long45;context models. Our interactive method not only enhances reasoning capabilities but also mitigates the associated training and computational costs making it a pragmatic solution for enhancing LLMs reasoning within expansive contexts.

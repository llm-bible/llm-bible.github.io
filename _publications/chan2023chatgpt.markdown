This paper aims to quantitatively evaluate the performance of ChatGPT an interactive large language model on inter45;sentential relations such as temporal relations causal relations and discourse relations. Given ChatGPTs promising performance across various tasks we proceed to carry out thorough evaluations on the whole test sets of 11 datasets including temporal and causal relations PDTB2.045;based and dialogue45;based discourse relations. To ensure the reliability of our findings we employ three tailored prompt templates for each task including the zero45;shot prompt template zero45;shot prompt engineering (PE) template and in45;context learning (ICL) prompt template to establish the initial baseline scores for all popular sentence45;pair relation classification tasks for the first time. Through our study we discover that ChatGPT exhibits exceptional proficiency in detecting and reasoning about causal relations albeit it may not possess the same level of expertise in identifying the temporal order between two events. While it is capable of identifying the majority of discourse relations with existing explicit discourse connectives the implicit discourse relation remains a formidable challenge. Concurrently ChatGPT demonstrates subpar performance in the dialogue discourse parsing task that requires structural understanding in a dialogue before being aware of the discourse relation.

In contrast to conventional visual question answering video45;grounded dialog necessitates a profound understanding of both dialog history and video content for accurate response generation. Despite commendable progress made by existing approaches they still face the challenges of incrementally understanding complex dialog history and assimilating video information. In response to these challenges we present an iterative search and reasoning framework which consists of a textual encoder a visual encoder and a generator. Specifically we devise a path search and aggregation strategy in the textual encoder mining core cues from dialog history that are pivotal to understanding the posed questions. Concurrently our visual encoder harnesses an iterative reasoning network to extract and emphasize critical visual markers from videos enhancing the depth of visual comprehension. Finally we utilize the pre45;trained GPT45;2 model as our answer generator to decode the mined hidden clues into coherent and contextualized answers. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed framework.

The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a competitive
landscape for AI-assisted programming tools. This study evaluates two leading
models: ChatGPT 03-mini and DeepSeek-R1 on their ability to solve competitive
programming tasks from Codeforces. Using 29 programming tasks of three levels
of easy, medium, and hard difficulty, we assessed the outcome of both models by
their accepted solutions, memory efficiency, and runtime performance. Our
results indicate that while both models perform similarly on easy tasks,
ChatGPT outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on medium-difficulty tasks, achieving a 54.5%
success rate compared to DeepSeek 18.1%. Both models struggled with hard tasks,
thus highlighting some ongoing challenges LLMs face in handling highly complex
programming problems. These findings highlight key differences in both model
capabilities and their computational power, offering valuable insights for
developers and researchers working to advance AI-driven programming tools.

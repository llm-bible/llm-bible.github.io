Instruction-finetuned Large Language Models exhibit unprecedented Natural Language Understanding capabilities. Recent work has been exploring political biases and political reasoning capabilities in LLMs mainly scoped in the US context. In light of the recent 2024 European Parliament elections we are investigating if LLMs can be used as Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). We audit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the stance of political parties based on the latest EU and I voting assistance questionnaire. Furthermore we explore alternatives to improve models performance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) relying on web search and Self-Reflection using staged conversations that aim to re-collect relevant content from the models internal memory. We find that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 8237; accuracy on average. Augmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a significant boost of approx. 937; which remains an open challenge for automated approaches.

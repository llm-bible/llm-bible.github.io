Med4245;v2 introduces a suite of clinical large language models (LLMs) designed to address the limitations of generic models in healthcare settings. These models are built on Llama3 architecture and fine45;tuned using specialized clinical data. They underwent multi45;stage preference alignment to effectively respond to natural prompts. While generic models are often preference45;aligned to avoid answering clinical queries as a precaution Med4245;v2 is specifically trained to overcome this limitation enabling its use in clinical settings. Med4245;v2 models demonstrate superior performance compared to the original Llama3 models in both 8B and 70B parameter configurations and GPT45;4 across various medical benchmarks. These LLMs are developed to understand clinical queries perform reasoning tasks and provide valuable assistance in clinical environments. The models are now publicly available at href123;https://huggingface.co/m42&#45;health&#125;&#123;https://huggingface.co/m42&#45;health&#125;.

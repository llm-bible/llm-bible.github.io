Recent research in neural machine translation (NMT) has shown that training on high45;quality machine45;generated data can outperform training on human45;generated data. This work accompanies the first45;ever release of a LLM45;generated MBR45;decoded and QE45;reranked dataset with both sentence45;level and multi45;sentence examples. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the quality of our dataset in terms of its downstream impact on NMT model performance. We find that training from scratch on our (machine45;generated) dataset outperforms training on the (web45;crawled) WMT23 training dataset (which is 300 times larger) and also outperforms training on the top45;quality subset of the WMT23 training dataset. We also find that performing self45;distillation by finetuning the LLM which generated this dataset outperforms the LLMs strong few45;shot baseline. These findings corroborate the quality of our dataset and demonstrate the value of high45;quality machine45;generated data in improving performance of NMT models.

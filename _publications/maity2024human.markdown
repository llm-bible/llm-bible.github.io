As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into educational
environments, how can we ensure that these systems are both understandable and
trustworthy? The growing demand for explainability in AI systems is a critical
area of focus. This paper explores Human-Centric eXplainable AI (HCXAI) in the
educational landscape, emphasizing its role in enhancing learning outcomes,
fostering trust among users, and ensuring transparency in AI-driven tools,
particularly through the innovative use of large language models (LLMs). What
challenges arise in the implementation of explainable AI in educational
contexts? This paper analyzes these challenges, addressing the complexities of
AI models and the diverse needs of users. It outlines comprehensive frameworks
for developing HCXAI systems that prioritize user understanding and engagement,
ensuring that educators and students can effectively interact with these
technologies. Furthermore, what steps can educators, developers, and
policymakers take to create more effective, inclusive, and ethically
responsible AI solutions in education? The paper provides targeted
recommendations to address this question, highlighting the necessity of
prioritizing explainability. By doing so, how can we leverage AI's
transformative potential to foster equitable and engaging educational
experiences that support diverse learners?

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI45;mediated communication (AIMC) tools powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to interpersonal communication. Employing a mixed45;methods approach we conducted a one45;week diary and interview study to explore users perceptions of these tools ability to 1) support interpersonal communication in the short45;term and 2) lead to potential long45;term effects. Our findings indicate that participants view AIMC support favorably citing benefits such as increased communication confidence and finding precise language to express their thoughts navigating linguistic and cultural barriers. However the study also uncovers current limitations of AIMC tools including verbosity unnatural responses and excessive emotional intensity. These shortcomings are further exacerbated by user concerns about inauthenticity and potential overreliance on the technology. Furthermore we identified four key communication spaces delineated by communication stakes (high or low) and relationship dynamics (formal or informal) that differentially predict users attitudes toward AIMC tools. Specifically participants found the tool is more suitable for communicating in formal relationships than informal ones and more beneficial in high45;stakes than low45;stakes communication.

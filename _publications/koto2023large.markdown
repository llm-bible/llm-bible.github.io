Although large language models (LLMs) are often pre-trained on large-scale
multilingual texts, their reasoning abilities and real-world knowledge are
mainly evaluated based on English datasets. Assessing LLM capabilities beyond
English is increasingly vital but hindered due to the lack of suitable
datasets. In this work, we introduce IndoMMLU, the first multi-task language
understanding benchmark for Indonesian culture and languages, which consists of
questions from primary school to university entrance exams in Indonesia. By
employing professional teachers, we obtain 14,981 questions across 64 tasks and
education levels, with 46% of the questions focusing on assessing proficiency
in the Indonesian language and knowledge of nine local languages and cultures
in Indonesia. Our empirical evaluations show that GPT-3.5 only manages to pass
the Indonesian primary school level, with limited knowledge of local Indonesian
languages and culture. Other smaller models such as BLOOMZ and Falcon perform
at even lower levels.

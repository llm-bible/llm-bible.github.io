Long45;form videos that span across wide temporal intervals are highly information redundant and contain multiple distinct events or entities that are often loosely45;related. Therefore when performing long45;form video question answering (LVQA)all information necessary to generate a correct response can often be contained within a small subset of frames. Recent literature explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in LVQA benchmarks achieving exceptional performance while relying on vision language models (VLMs) to convert all visual content within videos into natural language. Such VLMs often independently caption a large number of frames uniformly sampled from long videos which is not efficient and can mostly be redundant. Questioning these decision choices we explore optimal strategies for key45;frame selection and sequence45;aware captioning that can significantly reduce these redundancies. We propose two novel approaches that improve each of aspects namely Hierarchical Keyframe Selector and Sequential Visual LLM. Our resulting framework termed LVNet achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance across three benchmark LVQA datasets. Our code will be released publicly.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in *code*
understanding and generation, making coding tasks a key focus for researchers
due to their practical applications and value as a testbed for LLM evaluation.
Data synthesis and filtering techniques have been widely adopted and shown to
be highly effective in this context. In this paper, we present a focused survey
and taxonomy of these techniques, emphasizing recent advancements. We highlight
key challenges, explore future research directions, and offer practical
guidance for new researchers entering the field.

Recent progress in natural language processing has been driven by advances in
both model architecture and model pretraining. Transformer architectures have
facilitated building higher-capacity models and pretraining has made it
possible to effectively utilize this capacity for a wide variety of tasks.
\textit\{Transformers\} is an open-source library with the goal of opening up
these advances to the wider machine learning community. The library consists of
carefully engineered state-of-the art Transformer architectures under a unified
API. Backing this library is a curated collection of pretrained models made by
and available for the community. \textit\{Transformers\} is designed to be
extensible by researchers, simple for practitioners, and fast and robust in
industrial deployments. The library is available at
\url\{https://github.com/huggingface/transformers\}.

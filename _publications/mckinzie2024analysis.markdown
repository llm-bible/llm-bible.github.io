In this work, we discuss building performant Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). In particular, we study the importance of various architecture
components and data choices. Through careful and comprehensive ablations of the
image encoder, the vision language connector, and various pre-training data
choices, we identified several crucial design lessons. For example, we
demonstrate that for large-scale multimodal pre-training using a careful mix of
image-caption, interleaved image-text, and text-only data is crucial for
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) few-shot results across multiple benchmarks,
compared to other published pre-training results. Further, we show that the
image encoder together with image resolution and the image token count has
substantial impact, while the vision-language connector design is of
comparatively negligible importance. By scaling up the presented recipe, we
build MM1, a family of multimodal models up to 30B parameters, including both
dense models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) variants, that are SOTA in
pre-training metrics and achieve competitive performance after supervised
fine-tuning on a range of established multimodal benchmarks. Thanks to
large-scale pre-training, MM1 enjoys appealing properties such as enhanced
in-context learning, and multi-image reasoning, enabling few-shot
chain-of-thought prompting.

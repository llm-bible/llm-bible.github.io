Integrating large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT into computer science
education offers transformative potential for complex courses such as data
structures and algorithms (DSA). This study examines ChatGPT as a supplementary
tool for teaching assistants (TAs), guided by structured prompts and human
oversight, to enhance instruction and student outcomes. A controlled experiment
compared traditional TA-led instruction with a hybrid approach where TAs used
ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT o1 to generate exercises, clarify concepts, and provide
feedback. Structured prompts emphasized problem decomposition, real-world
context, and code examples, enabling tailored support while mitigating
over-reliance on AI. Results demonstrated the hybrid approach's efficacy, with
students in the ChatGPT-assisted group scoring 16.50 points higher on average
and excelling in advanced topics. However, ChatGPT's limitations necessitated
TA verification. This framework highlights the dual role of LLMs: augmenting TA
efficiency while ensuring accuracy through human oversight, offering a scalable
solution for human-AI collaboration in education.

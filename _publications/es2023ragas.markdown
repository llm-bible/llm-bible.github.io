We introduce RAGAs (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) a framework for reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database which enables them to act as a natural language layer between a user and textual databases reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is however challenging because there are several dimensions to consider the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way or the quality of the generation itself. With RAGAs we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions . We posit that such a framework can crucially contribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG architectures which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs.

Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer learning experiences through interactions based on natural language. They are recognized for promoting cognitive engagement and improving learning outcomes especially in reasoning tasks. Nonetheless the cost associated with authoring CTS content is a major obstacle to widespread adoption and to research on effective instructional design. In this paper we discuss and evaluate a novel type of CTS that leverages recent advances in large language models (LLMs) in two ways First the system enables AI-assisted content authoring by inducing an easily editable tutoring script automatically from a lesson text. Second the system automates the script orchestration in a learning-by-teaching format via two LLM-based agents (Ruffleamp;Riley) acting as a student and a professor. The system allows for free-form conversations that follow the ITS-typical inner and outer loop structure. We evaluate Ruffleamp;Rileys ability to support biology lessons in two between-subject online user studies (N = 200) comparing the system to simpler QA chatbots and reading activity. Analyzing system usage patterns pre/post-test scores and user experience surveys we find that Ruffleamp;Riley users report high levels of engagement understanding and perceive the offered support as helpful. Even though Ruffleamp;Riley users require more time to complete the activity we did not find significant differences in short-term learning gains over the reading activity. Our system architecture and user study provide various insights for designers of future CTSs. We further open-source our system to support ongoing research on effective instructional design of LLM-based learning technologies.

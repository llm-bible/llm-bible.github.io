This study explores Artificial Intelligence use, specifically ChatGPT, in
creating educational content. The study aims to elaborate on using ChatGPT to
create course materials. The main objective is to assess the efficiency,
quality, and impact of AI-driven course generation, and to create a Multimedia
Databases course as a case study. The study highlights the potential of AI to
revolutionize educational content creation, making it more accessible,
personalized, and efficient. The course content was generated in less than one
day through iterative methods, using prompts for translation, content
expansion, practical examples, assignments, supplementary materials, and LaTeX
formatting. Each part was verified immediately after generation to ensure
accuracy. Post-generation analysis with Detectia and Turnitin showed similarity
rates of 8.7% and 13%, indicating high originality. Experts and university
committees reviewed and approved the course, with English university teachers
praising its language quality. ChatGPT also created a well-structured and
diversified exam for the module. Key findings reveal significant time
efficiency, comprehensive content coverage, and high flexibility. The study
underscores AI's transformative potential in education, addressing challenges
related to data privacy, technology dependence, content accuracy, and
algorithmic biases. The conclusions emphasize the need for collaboration
between educators, policymakers, and technology developers to harness AI's
benefits in education fully.

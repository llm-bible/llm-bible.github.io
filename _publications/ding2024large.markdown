Trading is a highly competitive task that requires a combination of strategy knowledge and psychological fortitude. With the recent success of large language models(LLMs) it is appealing to apply the emerging intelligence of LLM agents in this competitive arena and understanding if they can outperform professional traders. In this survey we provide a comprehensive review of the current research on using LLMs as agents in financial trading. We summarize the common architecture used in the agent the data inputs and the performance of LLM trading agents in backtesting as well as the challenges presented in these research. This survey aims to provide insights into the current state of LLM-based financial trading agents and outline future research directions in this field.

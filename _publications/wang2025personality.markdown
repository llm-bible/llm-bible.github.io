Although psychometrics researchers have recently explored the use of large
language models (LLMs) as proxies for human participants, LLMs often fail to
generate heterogeneous data with human-like diversity, which diminishes their
value in advancing social science research. To address these challenges, we
explored the potential of the theory-informed Personality Structured Interview
(PSI) as a tool for simulating human responses in personality research. In this
approach, the simulation is grounded in nuanced real-human interview
transcripts that target the personality construct of interest. We have provided
a growing set of 357 structured interview transcripts from a representative
sample, each containing an individual's response to 32 open-ended questions
carefully designed to gather theory-based personality evidence. Additionally,
grounded in psychometric research, we have summarized an evaluation framework
to systematically validate LLM-generated psychometric data. Results from three
experiments demonstrate that well-designed structured interviews could improve
human-like heterogeneity in LLM-simulated personality data and predict
personality-related behavioral outcomes (i.e., organizational citizenship
behaviors and counterproductive work behavior). We further discuss the role of
theory-informed structured interviews in LLM-based simulation and outline a
general framework for designing structured interviews to simulate human-like
data for psychometric research.

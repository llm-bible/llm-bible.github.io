Large language models (LLMs) have recently received considerable attention as alternative solutions for task planning. However comparing the performance of language-oriented task planners becomes difficult and there exists a dearth of detailed exploration regarding the effects of various factors such as pre-trained model selection and prompt construction. To address this we propose a benchmark system for automatically quantifying performance of task planning for home-service embodied agents. Task planners are tested on two pairs of datasets and simulators 1) ALFRED and AI2-THOR 2) an extension of Watch-And-Help and VirtualHome. Using the proposed benchmark system we perform extensive experiments with LLMs and prompts and explore several enhancements of the baseline planner. We expect that the proposed benchmark tool would accelerate the development of language-oriented task planners.

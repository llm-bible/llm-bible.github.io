While Chain45;of45;Thought prompting is popular in reasoning tasks its application to Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) is under45;explored. Motivated by multi45;step reasoning of LLMs we propose Coarse45;to45;Fine Chain45;of45;Thought (CoF45;CoT) approach that breaks down NLU tasks into multiple reasoning steps where LLMs can learn to acquire and leverage essential concepts to solve tasks from different granularities. Moreover we propose leveraging semantic45;based Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) structured knowledge as an intermediate step to capture the nuances and diverse structures of utterances and to understand connections between their varying levels of granularity. Our proposed approach is demonstrated effective in assisting the LLMs adapt to the multi45;grained NLU tasks under both zero45;shot and few45;shot multi45;domain settings.

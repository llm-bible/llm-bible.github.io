This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate estimates of concreteness valence and arousal for multi-word expressions. Unlike previous artificial intelligence (AI) methods LLMs can capture the nuanced meanings of multi-word expressions. We systematically evaluated ChatGPT-4os ability to predict concreteness valence and arousal. In Study 1 ChatGPT-4o showed strong correlations with human concreteness ratings (r = .8) for multi-word expressions. In Study 2 these findings were repeated for valence and arousal ratings of individual words matching or outperforming previous AI models. Study 3 extended the prevalence and arousal analysis to multi-word expressions and showed promising results despite the lack of large-scale human benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for generating valuable psycholinguistic data related to multiword expressions. To help researchers with stimulus selection we provide datasets with AI norms of concreteness valence and arousal for 126397 English single words and 63680 multi-word expressions

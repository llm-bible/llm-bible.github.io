Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming artificial intelligence enabling autonomous agents to perform diverse tasks across various domains. These agents proficient in human-like text comprehension and generation have the potential to revolutionize sectors from customer service to healthcare. However they face challenges such as multimodality human value alignment hallucinations and evaluation. Techniques like prompting reasoning tool utilization and in-context learning are being explored to enhance their capabilities. Evaluation platforms like AgentBench WebArena and ToolLLM provide robust methods for assessing these agents in complex scenarios. These advancements are leading to the development of more resilient and capable autonomous agents anticipated to become integral in our digital lives assisting in tasks from email responses to disease diagnosis. The future of AI with LLMs at the forefront is promising.

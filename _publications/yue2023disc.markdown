We propose DISC-LawLLM, an intelligent legal system utilizing large language
models (LLMs) to provide a wide range of legal services. We adopt legal
syllogism prompting strategies to construct supervised fine-tuning datasets in
the Chinese Judicial domain and fine-tune LLMs with legal reasoning capability.
We augment LLMs with a retrieval module to enhance models' ability to access
and utilize external legal knowledge. A comprehensive legal benchmark,
DISC-Law-Eval, is presented to evaluate intelligent legal systems from both
objective and subjective dimensions. Quantitative and qualitative results on
DISC-Law-Eval demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in serving various
users across diverse legal scenarios. The detailed resources are available at
https://github.com/FudanDISC/DISC-LawLLM.

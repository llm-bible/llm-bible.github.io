This paper presents the ADAIO teams system entry in the Building Educational Applications (BEA) 2023 Shared Task on Generating AI Teacher Responses in Educational Dialogues. The task aims to assess the performance of state45;of45;the45;art generative models as AI teachers in producing suitable responses within a student45;teacher dialogue. Our system comprises evaluating various baseline models using OpenAI GPT45;3 and designing diverse prompts to prompt the OpenAI models for teacher response generation. After the challenge our system achieved second place by employing a few45;shot prompt45;based approach with the OpenAI text45;davinci45;003 model. The results highlight the few45;shot learning capabilities of large45;language models particularly OpenAIs GPT45;3 in the role of AI teachers.

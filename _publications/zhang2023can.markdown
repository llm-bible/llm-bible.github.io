The meaning of complex phrases in natural language is composed of their individual components. The task of compositional generalization evaluates a models ability to understand new combinations of components. Previous studies trained smaller task45;specific models which exhibited poor generalization. While large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive generalization abilities on many tasks through in45;context learning (ICL) their potential for compositional generalization remains unexplored. In this paper we first empirically investigate prevailing ICL methods in compositional generalization. We find that they struggle with complex compositional questions due to cumulative errors in long reasoning steps and intricate logic required for tool45;making. Consequently we propose a human45;guided tool manipulation framework (HTM) that generates tools for sub45;questions and integrates multiple tools. Our method enhances the effectiveness of tool creation and usage with minimal human effort. Experiments show that our method achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance on two compositional generalization benchmarks and outperforms existing methods on the most challenging test split by 7037;.

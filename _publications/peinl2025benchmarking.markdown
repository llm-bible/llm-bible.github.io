Similar to LLMs, the development of vision language models is mainly driven
by English datasets and models trained in English and Chinese language, whereas
support for other languages, even those considered high-resource languages such
as German, remains significantly weaker. In this work we present an analysis of
open-weight VLMs on factual knowledge in the German and English language. We
disentangle the image-related aspects from the textual ones by analyzing
accu-racy with jury-as-a-judge in both prompt languages and images from German
and international contexts. We found that for celebrities and sights, VLMs
struggle because they are lacking visual cognition of German image contents.
For animals and plants, the tested models can often correctly identify the
image contents ac-cording to the scientific name or English common name but
fail in German lan-guage. Cars and supermarket products were identified equally
well in English and German images across both prompt languages.

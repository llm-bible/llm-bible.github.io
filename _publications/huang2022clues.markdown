A trending paradigm for multiple45;choice question answering (MCQA) is using a text45;to45;text framework. By unifying data in different tasks into a single text45;to45;text format it trains a generative encoder45;decoder model which is both powerful and universal. However a side effect of twisting a generation target to fit the classification nature of MCQA is the under45;utilization of the decoder and the knowledge that can be decoded. To exploit the generation capability and underlying knowledge of a pre45;trained encoder45;decoder model in this paper we propose a generation45;enhanced MCQA model named GenMC. It generates a clue from the question and then leverages the clue to enhance a reader for MCQA. It outperforms text45;to45;text models on multiple MCQA datasets.

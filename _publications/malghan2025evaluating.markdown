Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as transformative tools in the
healthcare sector, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in natural language
understanding and generation. However, their proficiency in numerical
reasoning, particularly in high-stakes domains like in clinical applications,
remains underexplored. Numerical reasoning is critical in healthcare
applications, influencing patient outcomes, treatment planning, and resource
allocation. This study investigates the computational accuracy of LLMs in
numerical reasoning tasks within healthcare contexts. Using a curated dataset
of 1,000 numerical problems, encompassing real-world scenarios such as dosage
calculations and lab result interpretations, the performance of a refined LLM
based on the GPT-3 architecture was evaluated. The methodology includes prompt
engineering, integration of fact-checking pipelines, and application of
regularization techniques to enhance model accuracy and generalization. Key
metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized to assess the
model's efficacy. The results indicate an overall accuracy of 84.10%, with
improved performance in straightforward numerical tasks and challenges in
multi-step reasoning. The integration of a fact-checking pipeline improved
accuracy by 11%, underscoring the importance of validation mechanisms. This
research highlights the potential of LLMs in healthcare numerical reasoning and
identifies avenues for further refinement to support critical decision-making
in clinical environments. The findings aim to contribute to the development of
reliable, interpretable, and contextually relevant AI tools for healthcare.

Addressing the global challenge of breast cancer this research explores the fusion of generative AI focusing on ChatGPT 3.5 turbo model and the intricacies of breast cancer risk assessment. The research aims to evaluate ChatGPTs reasoning capabilities emphasizing its potential to process rules and provide explanations for screening recommendations. The study seeks to bridge the technology gap between intelligent machines and clinicians by demonstrating ChatGPTs unique proficiency in natural language reasoning. The methodology employs a supervised prompt-engineering approach to enforce detailed explanations for ChatGPTs recommendations. Synthetic use cases generated algorithmically serve as the testing ground for the encoded rules evaluating the models processing prowess. Findings highlight ChatGPTs promising capacity in processing rules comparable to Expert System Shells with a focus on natural language reasoning. The research introduces the concept of reinforcement explainability showcasing its potential in elucidating outcomes and facilitating user-friendly interfaces for breast cancer risk assessment.

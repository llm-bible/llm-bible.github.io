Despite the success of vision-language models in various generative tasks,
obtaining high-quality semantic representations for products and user intents
is still challenging due to the inability of off-the-shelf models to capture
nuanced relationships between the entities. In this paper, we introduce a joint
training framework for product and user queries by aligning uni-modal and
multi-modal encoders through contrastive learning on image-text data. Our novel
approach trains a query encoder with an LLM-curated relevance dataset,
eliminating the reliance on engagement history. These embeddings demonstrate
strong generalization capabilities and improve performance across applications,
including product categorization and relevance prediction. For personalized ads
recommendation, a significant uplift in the click-through rate and conversion
rate after the deployment further confirms the impact on key business metrics.
We believe that the flexibility of our framework makes it a promising solution
toward enriching the user experience across the e-commerce landscape.

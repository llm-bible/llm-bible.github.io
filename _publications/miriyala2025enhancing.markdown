We explore the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with large language
models (LLMs) to improve the accuracy of granular sentiment categorization in
app store reviews. Traditional numeric and polarity-based ratings often fail to
capture the nuanced sentiment embedded in user feedback. We evaluated the
effectiveness of CoT prompting versus simple prompting on 2000 Amazon app
reviews by comparing each method's predictions to human judgements. CoT
prompting improved classification accuracy from 84% to 93% highlighting the
benefit of explicit reasoning in enhancing sentiment analysis performance.

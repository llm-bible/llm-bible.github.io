Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are quickly advancing AI to
the frontiers of practical consumer use and leading industries to re-evaluate
how they allocate resources for content production. Authoring of open
educational resources and hint content within adaptive tutoring systems is
labor intensive. Should LLMs like ChatGPT produce educational content on par
with human-authored content, the implications would be significant for further
scaling of computer tutoring system approaches. In this paper, we conduct the
first learning gain evaluation of ChatGPT by comparing the efficacy of its
hints with hints authored by human tutors with 77 participants across two
algebra topic areas, Elementary Algebra and Intermediate Algebra. We find that
70% of hints produced by ChatGPT passed our manual quality checks and that both
human and ChatGPT conditions produced positive learning gains. However, gains
were only statistically significant for human tutor created hints. Learning
gains from human-created hints were substantially and statistically
significantly higher than ChatGPT hints in both topic areas, though ChatGPT
participants in the Intermediate Algebra experiment were near ceiling and not
even with the control at pre-test. We discuss the limitations of our study and
suggest several future directions for the field. Problem and hint content used
in the experiment is provided for replicability.

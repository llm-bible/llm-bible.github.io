Pre-trained transformer models are the current state-of-the-art for natural language models processing. seBERT is such a model that was developed based on the BERT architecture but trained from scratch with software engineering data. We fine-tuned this model for the NLBSE challenge for the task of issue type prediction. Our model dominates the baseline fastText for all three issue types in both recall and precisio to achieve an overall F1-score of 85.737; which is an increase of 4.137; over the baseline.

While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promise in enhancing
long-term conversations, the increasing memory load as conversations progress
degrades retrieval accuracy. Drawing on psychological insights, we propose
LUFY, a simple yet effective method that focuses on emotionally arousing
memories and retains less than 10% of the conversation. In the user experiment,
participants interacted with three types of RAG chatbots, each for 2 hours over
4 sessions, marking the most extensive assessment of a chatbot's long-term
capabilities to date -- more than four times longer than any existing
benchmark. The results demonstrate that prioritizing arousing memories while
forgetting the majority of the conversation significantly enhances user
experience. This study pushes the frontier of long-term conversations and
highlights the importance of forgetting unimportant parts of conversations.

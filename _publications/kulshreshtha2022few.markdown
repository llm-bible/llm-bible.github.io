Existing work on generating hints in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) focuses mostly on manual and non45;personalized feedback. In this work we explore automatically generated questions as personalized feedback in an ITS. Our personalized feedback can pinpoint correct and incorrect or missing phrases in student answers as well as guide them towards correct answer by asking a question in natural language. Our approach combines cause45;effect analysis to break down student answers using text similarity45;based NLP Transformer models to identify correct and incorrect or missing parts. We train a few45;shot Neural Question Generation and Question Re45;ranking models to show questions addressing components missing in the student answers which steers students towards the correct answer. Our model vastly outperforms both simple and strong baselines in terms of student learning gains by 4537; and 2337; respectively when tested in a real dialogue45;based ITS. Finally we show that our personalized corrective feedback system has the potential to improve Generative Question Answering systems.

Audio Visual Scene-aware Dialog (AVSD) is a task to generate responses when discussing about a given video. The previous state-of-the-art model shows superior performance for this task using Transformer-based architecture. However there remain some limitations in learning better representation of modalities. Inspired by Neural Machine Translation (NMT) we propose the Transformer-based Modal Translator (TMT) to learn the representations of the source modal sequence by translating the source modal sequence to the related target modal sequence in a supervised manner. Based on Multimodal Transformer Networks (MTN) we apply TMT to video and dialog proposing MTN-TMT for the video-grounded dialog system. On the AVSD track of the Dialog System Technology Challenge 7 MTN-TMT outperforms the MTN and other submission models in both Video and Text task and Text Only task. Compared with MTN MTN-TMT improves all metrics especially achieving relative improvement up to 14.137; on CIDEr.

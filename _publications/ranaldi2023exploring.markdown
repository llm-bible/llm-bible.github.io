Pre45;trained Language Models such as BERT are impressive machines with the ability to memorize possibly generalized learning examples. We present here a small focused contribution to the analysis of the interplay between memorization and performance of BERT in downstream tasks. We propose PreCog a measure for evaluating memorization from pre45;training and we analyze its correlation with the BERTs performance. Our experiments show that highly memorized examples are better classified suggesting memorization is an essential key to success for BERT.

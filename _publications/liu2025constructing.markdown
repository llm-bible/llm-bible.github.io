Workflows play a crucial role in enhancing enterprise efficiency by
orchestrating complex processes with multiple tools or components. However,
hand-crafted workflow construction requires expert knowledge, presenting
significant technical barriers. Recent advancements in Large Language Models
(LLMs) have improved the generation of workflows from natural language
instructions (aka NL2Workflow), yet existing single LLM agent-based methods
face performance degradation on complex tasks due to the need for specialized
knowledge and the strain of task-switching. To tackle these challenges, we
propose WorkTeam, a multi-agent NL2Workflow framework comprising a supervisor,
orchestrator, and filler agent, each with distinct roles that collaboratively
enhance the conversion process. As there are currently no publicly available
NL2Workflow benchmarks, we also introduce the HW-NL2Workflow dataset, which
includes 3,695 real-world business samples for training and evaluation.
Experimental results show that our approach significantly increases the success
rate of workflow construction, providing a novel and effective solution for
enterprise NL2Workflow services.

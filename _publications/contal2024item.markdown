Large Language Models (LLM) hold immense promise for real45;world applications but their generic knowledge often falls short of domain45;specific needs. Fine45;tuning a common approach can suffer from catastrophic forgetting and hinder generalizability. In45;Context Learning (ICL) offers an alternative which can leverage Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide LLMs with relevant demonstrations for few45;shot learning tasks. This paper explores the desired qualities of a demonstration retrieval system for ICL. We argue that ICL retrieval in this context resembles item45;cold45;start recommender systems prioritizing discovery and maximizing information gain over strict relevance. We propose a novel evaluation method that measures the LLMs subsequent performance on NLP tasks eliminating the need for subjective diversity scores. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of diversity and quality bias in retrieved demonstrations for effective ICL and highlight the potential of recommender system techniques in this domain.

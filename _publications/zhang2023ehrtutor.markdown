Large language models have shown success as a tutor in education in various fields. Educating patients about their clinical visits plays a pivotal role in patients adherence to their treatment plans post-discharge. This paper presents EHRTutor an innovative multi-component framework leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) for patient education through conversational question-answering. EHRTutor first formulates questions pertaining to the electronic health record discharge instructions. It then educates the patient through conversation by administering each question as a test. Finally it generates a summary at the end of the conversation. Evaluation results using LLMs and domain experts have shown a clear preference for EHRTutor over the baseline. Moreover EHRTutor also offers a framework for generating synthetic patient education dialogues that can be used for future in-house system training.

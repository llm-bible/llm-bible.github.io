We present QGen Studio: an adaptive question-answer generation, training, and
evaluation platform. QGen Studio enables users to leverage large language
models (LLMs) to create custom question-answer datasets and fine-tune models on
this synthetic data. It features a dataset viewer and model explorer to
streamline this process. The dataset viewer provides key metrics and visualizes
the context from which the QA pairs are generated, offering insights into data
quality. The model explorer supports model comparison, allowing users to
contrast the performance of their trained LLMs against other models, supporting
performance benchmarking and refinement. QGen Studio delivers an interactive,
end-to-end solution for generating QA datasets and training scalable,
domain-adaptable models. The studio will be open-sourced soon, allowing users
to deploy it locally.

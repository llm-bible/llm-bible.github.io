Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in open-domain
question answering. However, the chunking process, which is essential to this
pipeline, often receives insufficient attention relative to retrieval and
synthesis components. This study emphasizes the critical role of chunking in
improving the performance of both dense passage retrieval and the end-to-end
RAG pipeline. We then introduce the Logits-Guided Multi-Granular Chunker
(LGMGC), a novel framework that splits long documents into contextualized,
self-contained chunks of varied granularity. Our experimental results,
evaluated on two benchmark datasets, demonstrate that LGMGC not only improves
the retrieval step but also outperforms existing chunking methods when
integrated into a RAG pipeline.

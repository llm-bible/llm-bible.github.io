Dialogue datasets are crucial for deep learning-based task-oriented dialogue system research. While numerous English language multi-domain task-oriented dialogue datasets have been developed and contributed to significant advancements in task-oriented dialogue systems such a dataset does not exist in Japanese and research in this area is limited compared to that in English. In this study towards the advancement of research and development of task-oriented dialogue systems in Japanese we constructed JMultiWOZ the first Japanese language large-scale multi-domain task-oriented dialogue dataset. Using JMultiWOZ we evaluated the dialogue state tracking and response generation capabilities of the state-of-the-art methods on the existing major English benchmark dataset MultiWOZ2.2 and the latest large language model (LLM)-based methods. Our evaluation results demonstrated that JMultiWOZ provides a benchmark that is on par with MultiWOZ2.2. In addition through evaluation experiments of interactive dialogues with the models and human participants we identified limitations in the task completion capabilities of LLMs in Japanese.

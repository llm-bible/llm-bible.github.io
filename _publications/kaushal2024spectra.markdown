Post-training quantization is the leading method for addressing memory-related bottlenecks in LLM inference but unfortunately it suffers from significant performance degradation below 4-bit precision. An alternative approach involves training compressed models directly at a low bitwidth (e.g. binary or ternary models). However the performance training dynamics and scaling trends of such models are not yet well understood. To address this issue we train and openly release the Spectra LLM suite consisting of 54 language models ranging from 99M to 3.9B parameters trained on 300B tokens. Spectra includes FloatLMs post-training quantized QuantLMs (3 4 6 and 8 bits) and ternary LLMs (TriLMs) - our improved architecture for ternary language modeling which significantly outperforms previously proposed ternary models of a given size (in bits) matching half-precision models at scale. For example TriLM 3.9B is (bit-wise) smaller than the half-precision FloatLM 830M but matches half-precision FloatLM 3.9B in commonsense reasoning and knowledge benchmarks. However TriLM 3.9B is also as toxic and stereotyping as FloatLM 3.9B a model six times larger in size. Additionally TriLM 3.9B lags behind FloatLM in perplexity on validation splits and web-based corpora but performs better on less noisy datasets like Lambada and PennTreeBank. To enhance understanding of low-bitwidth models we are releasing 500+ intermediate checkpoints of the Spectra suite at hrefhttps://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}{https://github.com/NolanoOrg/SpectraSuite}.

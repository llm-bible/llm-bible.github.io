We introduce ChatGLM an evolving family of large language models that we have been developing over time. This report primarily focuses on the GLM-4 language series which includes GLM-4 GLM-4-Air and GLM-4-9B. They represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of ChatGLM. To date the GLM-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in Chinese and English along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages and aligned primarily for Chinese and English usage. The high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post-training process which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. Evaluations show that GLM-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms GPT-4 in terms of general metrics such as MMLU GSM8K MATH BBH GPQA and HumanEval 2) gets close to GPT-4-Turbo in instruction following as measured by IFEval 3) matches GPT-4 Turbo (128K) and Claude 3 for long context tasks and 4) outperforms GPT-4 in Chinese alignments as measured by AlignBench. The GLM-4 All Tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) touse -- including web browser Python interpreter text-to-image model and user-defined functions -- to effectively complete complex tasks. In practical applications it matches and even surpasses GPT-4 All Tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using Python interpreter. Over the course we have open-sourced a series of models including ChatGLM-6B (three generations) GLM-4-9B (128K 1M) GLM-4V-9B WebGLM and CodeGeeX attracting over 10 million downloads on Hugging face in the year 2023 alone. The open models can be accessed through https://github.com/THUDM and https://huggingface.co/THUDM."

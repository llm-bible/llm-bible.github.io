Medical dialogue systems (MDS) enhance patient45;physician communication improve healthcare accessibility and reduce costs. However acquiring suitable data to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns prevent the use of real conversations necessitating synthetic alternatives. Synthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a promising solution to this issue providing realistic data while safeguarding privacy. Our approach SynDial uses a single LLM iteratively with zero45;shot prompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high45;quality synthetic dialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity and extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined thresholds achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop. Additionally evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality metric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.

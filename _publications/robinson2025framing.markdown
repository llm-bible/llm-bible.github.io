Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
contexts to support decision-making. While existing evaluations effectively
probe latent model capabilities, they often overlook the impact of context
framing on perceived rational decision-making. In this study, we introduce a
novel evaluation framework that systematically varies evaluation instances
across key features and procedurally generates vignettes to create highly
varied scenarios. By analyzing decision-making patterns across different
contexts with the same underlying game structure, we uncover significant
contextual variability in LLM responses. Our findings demonstrate that this
variability is largely predictable yet highly sensitive to framing effects. Our
results underscore the need for dynamic, context-aware evaluation methodologies
for real-world deployments.

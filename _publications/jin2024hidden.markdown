Recent studies indicate that Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 with Vision (GPT-4V) outperforms human physicians in medical challenge tasks. However these evaluations primarily focused on the accuracy of multi-choice questions alone. Our study extends the current scope by conducting a comprehensive analysis of GPT-4Vs rationales of image comprehension recall of medical knowledge and step-by-step multimodal reasoning when solving New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Image Challenges - an imaging quiz designed to test the knowledge and diagnostic capabilities of medical professionals. Evaluation results confirmed that GPT-4V performs comparatively to human physicians regarding multi-choice accuracy (81.637; vs. 77.837;). GPT-4V also performs well in cases where physicians incorrectly answer with over 7837; accuracy. However we discovered that GPT-4V frequently presents flawed rationales in cases where it makes the correct final choices (35.537;) most prominent in image comprehension (27.237;). Regardless of GPT-4Vs high accuracy in multi-choice questions our findings emphasize the necessity for further in-depth evaluations of its rationales before integrating such multimodal AI models into clinical workflows.

The unique capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the natural language text generation ability position them as strong candidates for providing explanation for recommendations. However despite the size of the LLM most existing models struggle to produce zero45;shot explanations reliably. To address this issue we propose a framework called Logic45;Scaffolding that combines the ideas of aspect45;based explanation and chain45;of45;thought prompting to generate explanations through intermediate reasoning steps. In this paper we share our experience in building the framework and present an interactive demonstration for exploring our results.

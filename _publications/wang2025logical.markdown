With the increasing interest in using large language models (LLMs) for
planning in natural language, understanding their behaviors becomes an
important research question. This work conducts a systematic investigation of
LLMs' ability to perform logical reasoning in natural language. We introduce a
controlled dataset of hypothetical and disjunctive syllogisms in propositional
and modal logic and use it as the testbed for understanding LLM performance.
Our results lead to novel insights in predicting LLM behaviors: in addition to
the probability of input (Gonen et al., 2023; McCoy et al., 2024), logical
forms should be considered as important factors. In addition, we show
similarities and discrepancies between the logical reasoning performances of
humans and LLMs by collecting and comparing behavioral data from both.

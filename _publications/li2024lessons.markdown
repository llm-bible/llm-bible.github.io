Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant stride toward Artificial General Intelligence. As scaling laws underscore the potential of increasing model sizes the academic community has intensified its investigations into LLMs with capacities exceeding 50 billion parameters. This technical report builds on our prior work with Tele-FLM (also known as FLM-2) a publicly available 52-billion-parameter model. We delve into two primary areas we first discuss our observation of Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) on Tele-FLM-52B which supports the less is more approach for SFT data construction; second we demonstrate our experiments and analyses on the best practices for progressively growing a model from 52 billion to 102 billion and subsequently to 1 trillion parameters. We will open-source a 1T model checkpoint namely Tele-FLM-1T to advance further training and research.

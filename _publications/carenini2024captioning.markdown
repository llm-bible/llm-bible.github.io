Automatically captioning visualizations is not new, but recent advances in large language models(LLMs) open exciting new possibilities. In this tutorial, after providing a brief review of Information Visualization (InfoVis) principles and past work in captioning, we introduce neural models and the transformer architecture used in generic LLMs. We then discuss their recent applications in InfoVis, with a focus on captioning. Additionally, we explore promising future directions in this field.

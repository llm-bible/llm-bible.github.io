Entity Alignment (EA) is vital for integrating diverse knowledge graph (KG) data playing a crucial role in data-driven AI applications. Traditional EA methods primarily rely on comparing entity embeddings but their effectiveness is constrained by the limited input KG data and the capabilities of the representation learning techniques. Against this backdrop we introduce ChatEA an innovative framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) to improve EA. To address the constraints of limited input KG data ChatEA introduces a KG-code translation module that translates KG structures into a format understandable by LLMs thereby allowing LLMs to utilize their extensive background knowledge to improve EA accuracy. To overcome the over-reliance on entity embedding comparisons ChatEA implements a two-stage EA strategy that capitalizes on LLMs capability for multi-step reasoning in a dialogue format thereby enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. Our experimental results affirm ChatEAs superior performance highlighting LLMs potential in facilitating EA tasks.

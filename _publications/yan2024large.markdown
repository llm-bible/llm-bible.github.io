With the increasing application of large language models (LLMs) in the
medical domain, evaluating these models' performance using benchmark datasets
has become crucial. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of various
benchmark datasets employed in medical LLM tasks. These datasets span multiple
modalities including text, image, and multimodal benchmarks, focusing on
different aspects of medical knowledge such as electronic health records
(EHRs), doctor-patient dialogues, medical question-answering, and medical image
captioning. The survey categorizes the datasets by modality, discussing their
significance, data structure, and impact on the development of LLMs for
clinical tasks such as diagnosis, report generation, and predictive decision
support. Key benchmarks include MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, BioASQ, PubMedQA, and
CheXpert, which have facilitated advancements in tasks like medical report
generation, clinical summarization, and synthetic data generation. The paper
summarizes the challenges and opportunities in leveraging these benchmarks for
advancing multimodal medical intelligence, emphasizing the need for datasets
with a greater degree of language diversity, structured omics data, and
innovative approaches to synthesis. This work also provides a foundation for
future research in the application of LLMs in medicine, contributing to the
evolving field of medical artificial intelligence.

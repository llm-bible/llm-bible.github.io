The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has innovated the development of dialog agents. Specially a well-trained LLM as a central process unit is capable of providing fluent and reasonable response for users request. Besides auxiliary tools such as external knowledge retrieval personalized character for vivid response short/long-term memory for ultra long context management are developed completing the usage experience for LLM-based dialog agents. However the above-mentioned techniques does not solve the issue of (textbf)personalization from user perspective agents response in a same fashion to different users without consideration of their features such as habits interests and past experience. In another words current implementation of dialog agents fail in knowing the user. The capacity of well-description and representation of user is under development. In this work we proposed a framework for dialog agent to incorporate user profiling (initialization update) users query and response is analyzed and organized into a structural user profile which is latter served to provide personal and more precise response. Besides we proposed a series of evaluation protocols for personalization to what extend the response is personal to the different users. The framework is named as (method) inspired by inscription of Know Yourself in the temple of Apollo (also known as (method)) in Ancient Greek. Few works have been conducted on incorporating personalization into LLM (method) is a pioneer work on guiding LLMs response to meet individuation via the application of dialog agents with a set of evaluation methods for measurement in personalization.

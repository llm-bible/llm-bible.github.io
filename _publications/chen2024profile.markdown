The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has innovated the development of dialog agents. Specially a well45;trained LLM as a central process unit is capable of providing fluent and reasonable response for users request. Besides auxiliary tools such as external knowledge retrieval personalized character for vivid response short/long45;term memory for ultra long context management are developed completing the usage experience for LLM45;based dialog agents. However the above45;mentioned techniques does not solve the issue of textbf123;personalization from user perspective125; agents response in a same fashion to different users without consideration of their features such as habits interests and past experience. In another words current implementation of dialog agents fail in knowing the user. The capacity of well45;description and representation of user is under development. In this work we proposed a framework for dialog agent to incorporate user profiling (initialization update) users query and response is analyzed and organized into a structural user profile which is latter served to provide personal and more precise response. Besides we proposed a series of evaluation protocols for personalization to what extend the response is personal to the different users. The framework is named as method123;125; inspired by inscription of Know Yourself in the temple of Apollo (also known as method123;125;) in Ancient Greek. Few works have been conducted on incorporating personalization into LLM method123;125; is a pioneer work on guiding LLMs response to meet individuation via the application of dialog agents with a set of evaluation methods for measurement in personalization.

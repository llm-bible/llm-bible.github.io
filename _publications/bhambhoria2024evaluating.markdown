This study evaluates the performance of general-purpose AI like ChatGPT in legal question-answering tasks highlighting significant risks to legal professionals and clients. It suggests leveraging foundational models enhanced by domain-specific knowledge to overcome these issues. The paper advocates for creating open-source legal AI systems to improve accuracy transparency and narrative diversity addressing general AIs shortcomings in legal contexts.

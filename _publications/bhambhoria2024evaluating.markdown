This study evaluates the performance of general-purpose AI, like ChatGPT, in
legal question-answering tasks, highlighting significant risks to legal
professionals and clients. It suggests leveraging foundational models enhanced
by domain-specific knowledge to overcome these issues. The paper advocates for
creating open-source legal AI systems to improve accuracy, transparency, and
narrative diversity, addressing general AI's shortcomings in legal contexts.

Transformers and large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized machine
learning, with attention mechanisms at the core of their success. As the
landscape of attention variants expands, so too do the challenges of optimizing
their performance, particularly across different hardware platforms. Current
optimization strategies are often narrowly focused, requiring extensive manual
intervention to accommodate changes in model configurations or hardware
environments. In this paper, we introduce AttentionEngine, a comprehensive
framework designed to streamline the optimization of attention mechanisms
across heterogeneous hardware backends. By decomposing attention computation
into modular operations with customizable components, AttentionEngine enables
flexible adaptation to diverse algorithmic requirements. The framework further
automates kernel optimization through a combination of programmable templates
and a robust cross-platform scheduling strategy. Empirical results reveal
performance gains of up to 10x on configurations beyond the reach of existing
methods. AttentionEngine offers a scalable, efficient foundation for developing
and deploying attention mechanisms with minimal manual tuning. Our code has

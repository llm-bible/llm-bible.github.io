Adapting large language models (LLMs) to new and diverse knowledge is
essential for their lasting effectiveness in real-world applications. This
survey provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods for expanding the
knowledge of LLMs, focusing on integrating various knowledge types, including
factual information, domain expertise, language proficiency, and user
preferences. We explore techniques, such as continual learning, model editing,
and retrieval-based explicit adaptation, while discussing challenges like
knowledge consistency and scalability. Designed as a guide for researchers and
practitioners, this survey sheds light on opportunities for advancing LLMs as
adaptable and robust knowledge systems.

Large language models such as GPT-4 and Med-PaLM have shown impressive performance on clinical tasks; however they require access to compute are closed-source and cannot be deployed on device. Mid-size models such as BioGPT-large BioMedLM LLaMA 2 and Mistral 7B avoid these drawbacks but their capacity for clinical tasks has been understudied. To help assess their potential for clinical use and help researchers decide which model they should use we compare their performance on two clinical question-answering (QA) tasks MedQA and consumer query answering. We find that Mistral 7B is the best performing model winning on all benchmarks and outperforming models trained specifically for the biomedical domain. While Mistral 7Bs MedQA score of 63.037; approaches the original Med-PaLM and it often can produce plausible responses to consumer health queries room for improvement still exists. This study provides the first head-to-head assessment of open source mid-sized models on clinical tasks.

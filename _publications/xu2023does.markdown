To what extent can language alone give rise to complex concepts or is embodied experience essential Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer fresh perspectives on this question. Although LLMs are trained on restricted modalities they exhibit human-like performance in diverse psychological tasks. Our study compared representations of 4442 lexical concepts between humans and ChatGPTs (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) across multiple dimensions including five key domains emotion salience mental visualization sensory and motor experience. We identify two main findings 1) Both models strongly align with human representations in non-sensorimotor domains but lag in sensory and motor areas with GPT-4 outperforming GPT-3.5; 2) GPT-4s gains are associated with its additional visual learning which also appears to benefit related dimensions like haptics and imageability. These results highlight the limitations of language in isolation and that the integration of diverse modalities of inputs leads to a more human-like conceptual representation.

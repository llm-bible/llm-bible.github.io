Generating long-term texts such as novels using artificial intelligence has
always been a challenge. A common approach is to use large language models
(LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes.
Despite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they
exhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in
character and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative
quality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and
Expanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By
combining this structure information with the novel data, an
instruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then
utilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In
the final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the
generation of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods
showcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, such as ChatGPT, are
reshaping how English as a foreign language (EFL) students write since students
can compose texts by integrating their own words with AI-generated text. This
study investigated how 59 Hong Kong secondary school students with varying
levels of academic achievement interacted with AI-generated text to compose a
feature article, exploring whether any interaction patterns benefited the
overall quality of the article. Through content analysis, multiple linear
regression and cluster analysis, we found the overall number of words --
whether AI- or human-generated -- is the main predictor of writing quality.
However, the impact varies by students' competence to write independently, for
instance, by using their own words accurately and coherently to compose a text,
and to follow specific interaction patterns with AI-generated text. Therefore,
although composing texts with human words and AI-generated text may become
prevalent in EFL writing classrooms, without educators' careful attention to
EFL writing pedagogy and AI literacy, high-achieving students stand to benefit
more from using AI-generated text than low-achieving students.

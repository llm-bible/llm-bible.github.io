Through recent advancements in speech technologies and introduction of smart assistants such as Amazon Alexa Apple Siri and Google Home increasing number of users are interacting with various applications through voice commands. E45;commerce companies typically display short product titles on their webpages either human45;curated or algorithmically generated when brevity is required. However these titles are dissimilar from natural spoken language. For example Lucky Charms Gluten Free Break45;fast Cereal 20.5 oz a box Lucky Charms Gluten Free is acceptable to display on a webpage while a similar title cannot be used in a voice based text45;to45;speech application. In such conversational systems an easy to comprehend sentence such as a 20.5 ounce box of lucky charms gluten free cereal is preferred. Compared to display devices where images and detailed product information can be presented to users short titles for products which convey the most important information are necessary when interfacing with voice assistants. We propose eBERT a sequence45;to45;sequence approach by further pre45;training the BERT embeddings on an e45;commerce product description corpus and then fine45;tuning the resulting model to generate short natural spoken language titles from input web titles. Our extensive experiments on a real45;world industry dataset as well as human evaluation of model output demonstrate that eBERT summarization outperforms comparable baseline models. Owing to the efficacy of the model a version of this model has been deployed in real45;world setting.

The role of large language models (LLMs) in education is an increasing area
of interest today, considering the new opportunities they offer for teaching,
learning, and assessment. This cutting-edge tutorial provides an overview of
the educational applications of NLP and the impact that the recent advances in
LLMs have had on this field. We will discuss the key challenges and
opportunities presented by LLMs, grounding them in the context of four major
educational applications: reading, writing, and speaking skills, and
intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). This COLING 2025 tutorial is designed for
researchers and practitioners interested in the educational applications of NLP
and the role LLMs have to play in this area. It is the first of its kind to
address this timely topic.

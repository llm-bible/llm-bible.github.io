OpenThaiGPT 1.5 is an advanced Thai language chat model based on Qwen v2.5,
finetuned on over 2,000,000 Thai instruction pairs. This report provides an
engineering perspective on the model's development, capabilities, and
performance. We discuss the model's architecture, training process, and key
features, including multi-turn conversation support, Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) compatibility, and tool-calling functionality. Benchmark
results demonstrate OpenThaiGPT 1.5's state-of-the-art performance on various
Thai language tasks, outperforming other open-source Thai language models. We
also address practical considerations such as GPU memory requirements and
deployment strategies.

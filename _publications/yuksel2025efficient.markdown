This paper introduces an advanced methodology for machine translation (MT)
corpus generation, integrating semi-automated, human-in-the-loop post-editing
with large language models (LLMs) to enhance efficiency and translation
quality. Building upon previous work that utilized real-time training of a
custom MT quality estimation metric, this system incorporates novel LLM
features such as Enhanced Translation Synthesis and Assisted Annotation
Analysis, which improve initial translation hypotheses and quality assessments,
respectively. Additionally, the system employs LLM-Driven Pseudo Labeling and a
Translation Recommendation System to reduce human annotator workload in
specific contexts. These improvements not only retain the original benefits of
cost reduction and enhanced post-edit quality but also open new avenues for
leveraging cutting-edge LLM advancements. The project's source code is
available for community use, promoting collaborative developments in the field.

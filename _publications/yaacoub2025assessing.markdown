This study evaluates the integration of Bloom's Taxonomy into OneClickQuiz,
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven plugin for automating Multiple-Choice
Question (MCQ) generation in Moodle. Bloom's Taxonomy provides a structured
framework for categorizing educational objectives into hierarchical cognitive
levels. Our research investigates whether incorporating this taxonomy can
improve the alignment of AI-generated questions with specific cognitive
objectives. We developed a dataset of 3691 questions categorized according to
Bloom's levels and employed various classification models-Multinomial Logistic
Regression, Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (SVC), and a
Transformer-based model (DistilBERT)-to evaluate their effectiveness in
categorizing questions. Our results indicate that higher Bloom's levels
generally correlate with increased question length, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level
(FKGL), and Lexical Density (LD), reflecting the increased complexity of higher
cognitive demands. Multinomial Logistic Regression showed varying accuracy
across Bloom's levels, performing best for "Knowledge" and less accurately for
higher-order levels. Merging higher-level categories improved accuracy for
complex cognitive tasks. Naive Bayes and Linear SVC also demonstrated effective
classification for lower levels but struggled with higher-order tasks.
DistilBERT achieved the highest performance, significantly improving
classification of both lower and higher-order cognitive levels, achieving an
overall validation accuracy of 91%. This study highlights the potential of
integrating Bloom's Taxonomy into AI-driven assessment tools and underscores
the advantages of advanced models like DistilBERT for enhancing educational
content generation.

OpenAI's ChatGPT (GPT-4 and GPT-4o) and other Large Language Models (LLMs)
like Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Antrophic's Claude 3.5
Sonnet can be effectively used in various phases of scientific research. Their
performance in diverse verbal tasks and reasoning is close to or above the
average human level and rapidly increasing, providing those models with a
capacity that resembles a relatively high level of theory of mind. The current
ability of LLMs to process information about human psychology and communication
creates an opportunity for their scientific use in the fields of personality
psychology and interpersonal communication skills. This article illustrates the
possible uses of GPT-4o and other advanced LLMs for typical tasks in designing
self-assessment scales for interpersonal communication skills measurement like
the selection and improvement of scale items and evaluation of content validity
of scales. The potential for automated item generation and application is
illustrated as well. The case study examples are accompanied by prompts for
LLMs that can be useful for these purposes. Finally, a summary is provided of
the potential benefits of using LLMs in the process of evaluation, design, and
improvement of interpersonal communication skills self-assessment scales.

In this study we introduce AmbigNLG a new task designed to tackle the challenge of task ambiguity in instructions for Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Despite the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and executing a wide range of tasks through natural language interaction their performance is significantly hindered by the ambiguity present in real45;world instructions. To address this AmbigNLG seeks to identify and mitigate such ambiguities aiming to refine instructions to match user expectations better. We introduce a dataset AmbigSNI45;NLG consisting of 2500 instances and develop an ambiguity taxonomy for categorizing and annotating instruction ambiguities. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements in text generation quality highlighting the critical role of clear and specific instructions in enhancing LLM performance in NLG tasks.

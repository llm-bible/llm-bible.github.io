Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) technology, particularly large
language models (LLMs), is becoming increasingly vital for developing immersive
and interactive metaverse experiences. GPT, a representative LLM developed by
OpenAI, is leading LLM development and gaining attention for its potential in
building the metaverse. The article delves into the pros and cons of utilizing
GPT for metaverse-based education, entertainment, personalization, and support.
Dynamic and personalized experiences are possible with this technology, but
there are also legitimate privacy, bias, and ethical issues to consider. This
article aims to help readers understand the possible influence of GPT,
according to its unique technological advantages, on the metaverse and how it
may be used to effectively create a more immersive and engaging virtual
environment by evaluating these opportunities and obstacles.

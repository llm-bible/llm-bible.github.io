Verifiers or reward models are often used to enhance the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs). A common approach is the Best-of-N method where N candidate solutions generated by the LLM are ranked by a verifier and the best one is selected. While LLM-based verifiers are typically trained as discriminative classifiers to score solutions they do not utilize the text generation capabilities of pretrained LLMs. To overcome this limitation we instead propose training verifiers using the ubiquitous next-token prediction objective jointly on verification and solution generation. Compared to standard verifiers such generative verifiers (GenRM) can benefit from several advantages of LLMs they integrate seamlessly with instruction tuning enable chain-of-thought reasoning and can utilize additional inference-time compute via majority voting for better verification. We demonstrate that when using Gemma-based verifiers on algorithmic and grade-school math reasoning tasks GenRM outperforms discriminative verifiers and LLM-as-a-Judge showing a 16-6437; improvement in the percentage of problems solved with Best-of-N. Furthermore we show that GenRM scales favorably across dataset size model capacity and inference-time compute.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
diverse domains, yet their application in the legal sector, particularly in
low-resource contexts, remains limited. This study addresses the challenges of
adapting LLMs to the Palestinian legal domain, where political instability,
fragmented legal frameworks, and limited AI resources hinder effective
machine-learning applications. We present a fine-tuned model based on a
quantized version of Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, trained on a synthetic data set
derived from Palestinian legal texts. Using smaller-scale models and
strategically generated question-answer pairs, we achieve a cost-effective,
locally sustainable solution that provides accurate and contextually relevant
legal guidance. Our experiments demonstrate promising performance on various
query types, ranging from yes/no questions and narrative explanations to
complex legal differentiations, while highlighting areas for improvement, such
as handling calculation-based inquiries and structured list formatting. This
work provides a pathway for the deployment of AI-driven legal assistance tools
tailored to the needs of resource-constrained environments.

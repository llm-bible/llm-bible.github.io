Recent advances in general purpose pre-trained language models have shown great potential in commonsense reasoning. However current works still perform poorly on standard commonsense reasoning benchmarks including the Com2Sense Dataset. We argue that this is due to a disconnect with current cutting-edge machine learning methods. In this work we aim to bridge the gap by introducing current ML-based methods to improve general purpose pre-trained language models in the task of commonsense reasoning. Specifically we experiment with and systematically evaluate methods including knowledge transfer model ensemble and introducing an additional pairwise contrastive objective. Our best model outperforms the strongest previous works by ~15 absolute gains in Pairwise Accuracy and ~8.7 absolute gains in Standard Accuracy.

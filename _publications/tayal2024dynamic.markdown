When interacting with Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG)45;based conversational agents the users must carefully craft their queries to be understood correctly. Yet understanding the systems capabilities can be challenging for the users leading to ambiguous questions that necessitate further clarification. This work aims to bridge the gap by developing a suggestion question generator. To generate suggestion questions our approach involves utilizing dynamic context which includes both dynamic few45;shot examples and dynamically retrieved contexts. Through experiments we show that the dynamic contexts approach can generate better suggestion questions as compared to other prompting approaches.

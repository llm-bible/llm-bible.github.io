Science journalism reports current scientific discoveries to non-specialists aiming to enable public comprehension of the state of the art. However this task can be challenging as the audience often lacks specific knowledge about the presented research. To address this challenge we propose a framework that integrates three LLMs mimicking the real-world writing-reading-feedback-revision workflow with one LLM acting as the journalist a smaller LLM as the general public reader and the third LLM as an editor. The journalists writing is iteratively refined by feedback from the reader and suggestions from the editor. Our experiments demonstrate that by leveraging the collaboration of two 7B and one 1.8B open-source LLMs we can generate articles that are more accessible than those generated by existing methods including advanced models such as GPT-4.

Chain-of-Thought(CoT) prompting and its variants explore equipping large language models (LLMs) with high-level reasoning abilities by emulating human-like linear cognition and logic. However the human mind is complicated and mixed with both linear and nonlinear thinking. In this work we propose nferential xclusion rompting (IEP) a novel prompting that combines the principles of elimination and inference in order to guide LLMs to think non-linearly. IEP guides LLMs to plan and then utilize Natural Language Inference (NLI) to deduce each possible solutions entailment relation with context commonsense or facts therefore yielding a broader perspective by thinking back for inferring. This forward planning and backward eliminating process allows IEP to better simulate the complex human thinking processes compared to other CoT-based methods which only reflect linear cognitive processes. We conducted a series of empirical studies and have corroborated that IEP consistently outperforms CoT across various tasks. Additionally we observe that integrating IEP and CoT further improves the LLMs performance on certain tasks highlighting the necessity of equipping LLMs with mixed logic processes. Moreover to better evaluate comprehensive features inherent in human logic we introduce ental-bility easoning enchmark (MARB). The benchmark comprises six novel subtasks with a total of 9115 questions among which 1685 are developed with hand-crafted rationale references. We believe both and can serve as a promising direction for unveiling LLMs logic and verbal reasoning abilities and drive further advancements. will be available at ~ soon.

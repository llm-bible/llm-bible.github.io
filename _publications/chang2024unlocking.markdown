This booklet, Unlocking the Wisdom of Multi-LLM Collaborative Intelligence,
serves as an accessible introduction to the full volume The Path to Artificial
General Intelligence. Through fourteen aphorisms, it distills the core
principles of Multi-LLM Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework
designed to coordinate multiple LLMs toward reasoning, planning, and
decision-making that surpasses the capabilities of any single model. The
booklet includes titles, abstracts, and introductions from each main chapter,
along with the full content of the first two. The newly released third edition
features significant enhancements to Chapters 6 through 9 and a revised preface
responding to Yann LeCun's critique of AGI feasibility. While LeCun argues that
LLMs lack grounding, memory, and planning, we propose that MACI's collaborative
architecture, featuring multimodal agents in executive, legislative, and
judicial roles, directly addresses these limitations. Chapters on SocraSynth,
EVINCE, consciousness modeling, and behavior regulation demonstrate that
reasoning systems grounded in structured interaction and checks and balances
can produce more reliable, interpretable, and adaptive intelligence. By
integrating complementary model strengths, including world modeling and
multimodal perception, MACI enables a system-level intelligence that exceeds
the sum of its parts. Like human institutions, progress in AI may depend less
on isolated performance and more on coordinated judgment. Collaborative LLMs,
not just larger ones, may chart the path toward artificial general
intelligence.

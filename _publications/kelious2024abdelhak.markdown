This study introduces a dedicated model aimed at solving the BRAINTEASER task 9 a novel challenge designed to assess models lateral thinking capabilities through sentence and word puzzles. Our model demonstrates remarkable efficacy securing Rank 1 in sentence puzzle solving during the test phase with an overall score of 0.98. Additionally we explore the comparative performance of ChatGPT specifically analyzing how variations in temperature settings affect its ability to engage in lateral thinking and problem45;solving. Our findings indicate a notable performance disparity between the dedicated model and ChatGPT underscoring the potential of specialized approaches in enhancing creative reasoning in AI.

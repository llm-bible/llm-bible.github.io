Existing agents based on large language models (LLMs) demonstrate robust problem45;solving capabilities by integrating LLMs inherent knowledge strong in45;context learning and zero45;shot capabilities and the use of tools combined with intricately designed LLM invocation workflows by humans. However these agents still exhibit shortcomings in long45;term reasoning and under45;use the potential of existing tools leading to noticeable deficiencies in complex real45;world reasoning scenarios. To address these limitations we introduce Sibyl a simple yet powerful LLM45;based agent framework designed to tackle complex reasoning tasks by efficiently leveraging a minimal set of tools. Drawing inspiration from Global Workspace Theory Sibyl incorporates a global workspace to enhance the management and sharing of knowledge and conversation history throughout the system. Furthermore guided by Society of Mind Theory Sibyl implements a multi45;agent debate45;based jury to self45;refine the final answers ensuring a comprehensive and balanced approach. This approach aims to reduce system complexity while expanding the scope of problems solvable45;from matters typically resolved by humans in minutes to those requiring hours or even days thus facilitating a shift from System45;1 to System45;2 thinking. Sibyl has been designed with a focus on scalability and ease of debugging by incorporating the concept of reentrancy from functional programming from its inception with the aim of seamless and low effort integration in other LLM applications to improve capabilities. Our experimental results on the GAIA benchmark test set reveal that the Sibyl agent instantiated with GPT45;4 achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance with an average score of 34.5537; compared to other agents based on GPT45;4. We hope that Sibyl can inspire more reliable and reusable LLM45;based agent solutions to address complex real45;world reasoning tasks.

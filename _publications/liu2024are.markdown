The recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has garnered significant attention in both academia and industry. Prior research on LLMs has primarily focused on enhancing or leveraging their generalization capabilities in zero45; and few45;shot settings. However there has been limited investigation into effectively fine45;tuning LLMs for a specific natural language understanding task in supervised settings. In this study we conduct an experimental analysis by fine45;tuning LLMs for the task of Chinese short text matching. We explore various factors that influence performance when fine45;tuning LLMs including task modeling methods prompt formats and output formats.

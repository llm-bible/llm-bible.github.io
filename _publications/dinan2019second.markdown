We describe the setting and results of the ConvAI2 NeurIPS competition that
aims to further the state-of-the-art in open-domain chatbots. Some key
takeaways from the competition are: (i) pretrained Transformer variants are
currently the best performing models on this task, (ii) but to improve
performance on multi-turn conversations with humans, future systems must go
beyond single word metrics like perplexity to measure the performance across
sequences of utterances (conversations) -- in terms of repetition, consistency
and balance of dialogue acts (e.g. how many questions asked vs. answered).

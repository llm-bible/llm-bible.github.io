A chatbot is an intelligent software application that automates conversations
and engages users in natural language through messaging platforms. Leveraging
artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots serve various functions, including
customer service, information gathering, and casual conversation. Existing
virtual assistant chatbots, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, demonstrate the
potential of AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, many current
solutions rely on predefined APIs, which can result in vendor lock-in and high
costs. To address these challenges, this work proposes a chatbot developed
using a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an encoder-decoder
architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms and Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) cells. By avoiding predefined APIs, this approach ensures flexibility
and cost-effectiveness. The chatbot is trained, validated, and tested on a
dataset specifically curated for the tourism sector in Draa-Tafilalet, Morocco.
Key evaluation findings indicate that the proposed Seq2Seq model-based chatbot
achieved high accuracies: approximately 99.58% in training, 98.03% in
validation, and 94.12% in testing. These results demonstrate the chatbot's
effectiveness in providing relevant and coherent responses within the tourism
domain, highlighting the potential of specialized AI applications to enhance
user experience and satisfaction in niche markets.

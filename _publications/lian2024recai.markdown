This paper introduces RecAI a practical toolkit designed to augment or even revolutionize recommender systems with the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). RecAI provides a suite of tools including Recommender AI Agent Recommendation-oriented Language Models Knowledge Plugin RecExplainer and Evaluator to facilitate the integration of LLMs into recommender systems from multifaceted perspectives. The new generation of recommender systems empowered by LLMs are expected to be more versatile explainable conversational and controllable paving the way for more intelligent and user-centric recommendation experiences. We hope the open-source of RecAI can help accelerate evolution of new advanced recommender systems. The source code of RecAI is available at .

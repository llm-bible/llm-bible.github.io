We audit how hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is characterized
in peer-reviewed literature, using a critical examination of 103 publications
across NLP research. Through the examination of the literature, we identify a
lack of agreement with the term `hallucination' in the field of NLP.
Additionally, to compliment our audit, we conduct a survey with 171
practitioners from the field of NLP and AI to capture varying perspectives on
hallucination. Our analysis calls for the necessity of explicit definitions and
frameworks outlining hallucination within NLP, highlighting potential
challenges, and our survey inputs provide a thematic understanding of the
influence and ramifications of hallucination in society.

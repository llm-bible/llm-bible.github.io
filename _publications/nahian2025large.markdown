The ability to predict drug overdose risk from a patient's medical records is
crucial for timely intervention and prevention. Traditional machine learning
models have shown promise in analyzing longitudinal medical records for this
task. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer an
opportunity to enhance prediction performance by leveraging their ability to
process long textual data and their inherent prior knowledge across diverse
tasks. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of Open AI's GPT-4o LLM in
predicting drug overdose events using patients' longitudinal insurance claims
records. We evaluate its performance in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
comparing them to strong traditional machine learning methods as baselines. Our
results show that LLMs not only outperform traditional models in certain
settings but can also predict overdose risk in a zero-shot setting without
task-specific training. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs in
clinical decision support, particularly for drug overdose risk prediction.

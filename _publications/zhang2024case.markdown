Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in generating personalized content and facilitating interactive dialogues showcasing their remarkable aptitude for a myriad of applications. However their capabilities in reasoning and providing explainable outputs especially within the context of reasoning abilities remain areas for improvement. In this study we delve into the reasoning abilities of LLMs highlighting the current challenges and limitations that hinder their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios.

Efficiently evaluating the performance of text-to-image models is difficult
as it inherently requires subjective judgment and human preference, making it
hard to compare different models and quantify the state of the art. Leveraging
Rapidata's technology, we present an efficient annotation framework that
sources human feedback from a diverse, global pool of annotators. Our study
collected over 2 million annotations across 4,512 images, evaluating four
prominent models (DALL-E 3, Flux.1, MidJourney, and Stable Diffusion) on style
preference, coherence, and text-to-image alignment. We demonstrate that our
approach makes it feasible to comprehensively rank image generation models
based on a vast pool of annotators and show that the diverse annotator
demographics reflect the world population, significantly decreasing the risk of
biases.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the
development of intelligent LLM-based agents capable of interacting with
graphical user interfaces (GUIs). These agents demonstrate strong reasoning and
adaptability, enabling them to perform complex tasks that traditionally
required predefined rules. However, the reliance on step-by-step reasoning in
LLM-based agents often results in inefficiencies, particularly for routine
tasks. In contrast, traditional rule-based systems excel in efficiency but lack
the intelligence and flexibility to adapt to novel scenarios. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel evolutionary framework for GUI agents that
enhances operational efficiency while retaining intelligence and flexibility.
Our approach incorporates a memory mechanism that records the agent's task
execution history. By analyzing this history, the agent identifies repetitive
action sequences and evolves high-level actions that act as shortcuts,
replacing these low-level operations and improving efficiency. This allows the
agent to focus on tasks requiring more complex reasoning, while simplifying
routine actions. Experimental results on multiple benchmark tasks demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in both efficiency
and accuracy. The code will be open-sourced to support further research.

Eating disorders (ED) are complex mental health conditions that require
long-term management and support. Recent advancements in large language model
(LLM)-based chatbots offer the potential to assist individuals in receiving
immediate support. Yet, concerns remain about their reliability and safety in
sensitive contexts such as ED. We explore the opportunities and potential harms
of using LLM-based chatbots for ED recovery. We observe the interactions
between 26 participants with ED and an LLM-based chatbot, WellnessBot, designed
to support ED recovery, over 10 days. We discovered that our participants have
felt empowered in recovery by discussing ED-related stories with the chatbot,
which served as a personal yet social avenue. However, we also identified
harmful chatbot responses, especially concerning individuals with ED, that went
unnoticed partly due to participants' unquestioning trust in the chatbot's
reliability. Based on these findings, we provide design implications for safe
and effective LLM-based interventions in ED management.

Large language models (LLMs) have dramatically enhanced the field of language
intelligence, as demonstrably evidenced by their formidable empirical
performance across a spectrum of complex reasoning tasks. Additionally,
theoretical proofs have illuminated their emergent reasoning capabilities,
providing a compelling showcase of their advanced cognitive abilities in
linguistic contexts. Critical to their remarkable efficacy in handling complex
reasoning tasks, LLMs leverage the intriguing chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
techniques, obliging them to formulate intermediate steps en route to deriving
an answer. The CoT reasoning approach has not only exhibited proficiency in
amplifying reasoning performance but also in enhancing interpretability,
controllability, and flexibility. In light of these merits, recent research
endeavors have extended CoT reasoning methodologies to nurture the development
of autonomous language agents, which adeptly adhere to language instructions
and execute actions within varied environments. This survey paper orchestrates
a thorough discourse, penetrating vital research dimensions, encompassing: (i)
the foundational mechanics of CoT techniques, with a focus on elucidating the
circumstances and justification behind its efficacy; (ii) the paradigm shift in
CoT; and (iii) the burgeoning of language agents fortified by CoT approaches.
Prospective research avenues envelop explorations into generalization,
efficiency, customization, scaling, and safety. This paper caters to a wide
audience, including beginners seeking comprehensive knowledge of CoT reasoning
and language agents, as well as experienced researchers interested in
foundational mechanics and engaging in cutting-edge discussions on these
topics. A repository for the related papers is available at

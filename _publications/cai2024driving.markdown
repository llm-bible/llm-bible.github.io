This work presents an interpretable decision-making framework for autonomous
vehicles that integrates traffic regulations, norms, and safety guidelines
comprehensively and enables seamless adaptation to different regions. While
traditional rule-based methods struggle to incorporate the full scope of
traffic rules, we develop a Traffic Regulation Retrieval (TRR) Agent based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automatically retrieve relevant traffic
rules and guidelines from extensive regulation documents and relevant records
based on the ego vehicle's situation. Given the semantic complexity of the
retrieved rules, we also design a reasoning module powered by a Large Language
Model (LLM) to interpret these rules, differentiate between mandatory rules and
safety guidelines, and assess actions on legal compliance and safety.
Additionally, the reasoning is designed to be interpretable, enhancing both
transparency and reliability. The framework demonstrates robust performance on
both hypothesized and real-world cases across diverse scenarios, along with the
ability to adapt to different regions with ease.

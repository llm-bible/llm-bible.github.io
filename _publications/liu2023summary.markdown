This paper presents a comprehensive survey of ChatGPT45;related (GPT45;3.5 and GPT45;4) research state45;of45;the45;art large language models (LLM) from the GPT series and their prospective applications across diverse domains. Indeed key innovations such as large45;scale pre45;training that captures knowledge across the entire world wide web instruction fine45;tuning and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) have played significant roles in enhancing LLMs adaptability and performance. We performed an in45;depth analysis of 194 relevant papers on arXiv encompassing trend analysis word cloud representation and distribution analysis across various application domains. The findings reveal a significant and increasing interest in ChatGPT45;related research predominantly centered on direct natural language processing applications while also demonstrating considerable potential in areas ranging from education and history to mathematics medicine and physics. This study endeavors to furnish insights into ChatGPTs capabilities potential implications ethical concerns and offer direction for future advancements in this field.

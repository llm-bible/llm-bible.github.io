While large language models (LLMs) have made notable advancements in natural language processing they continue to struggle with processing extensive text. Memory mechanism offers a flexible solution for managing long contexts utilizing techniques such as compression summarization and structuring to facilitate nuanced and efficient handling of large volumes of text. However existing techniques face challenges with static knowledge integration leading to insufficient adaptation to task45;specific needs and missing multi45;segmentation relationships which hinders the dynamic reorganization and logical combination of relevant segments during the response process. To address these issues we introduce a novel strategy Question then Reflection Memory Mechanism (QRMeM) incorporating a dual45;structured memory pool. This pool synergizes static textual content with structured graph guidance fostering a reflective trial45;and45;error approach for navigating and identifying relevant segments. Our evaluation across multiple45;choice questions (MCQ) and multi45;document question answering (Multi45;doc QA) benchmarks showcases QRMeM enhanced performance compared to existing approaches.

Recent research has extended beyond assessing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) to examining their characteristics from a psychological standpoint acknowledging the necessity of understanding their behavioral characteristics. The administration of personality tests to LLMs has emerged as a noteworthy area in this context. However the suitability of employing psychological scales initially devised for humans on LLMs is a matter of ongoing debate. Our study aims to determine the reliability of applying personality assessments to LLMs explicitly investigating whether LLMs demonstrate consistent personality traits. Analyzing responses under 2500 settings reveals that gpt-3.5-turbo shows consistency in responses to the Big Five Inventory indicating a high degree of reliability. Furthermore our research explores the potential of gpt-3.5-turbo to emulate diverse personalities and represent various groups which is a capability increasingly sought after in social sciences for substituting human participants with LLMs to reduce costs. Our findings reveal that LLMs have the potential to represent different personalities with specific prompt instructions. By shedding light on the personalization of LLMs our study endeavors to pave the way for future explorations in this field. We have made our experimental results and the corresponding code openly accessible via https://github.com/CUHK-ARISE/LLMPersonality."

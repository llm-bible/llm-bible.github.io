Conversational counselor agents have become essential tools for addressing
the rising demand for scalable and accessible mental health support. This paper
introduces CAMI, a novel automated counselor agent grounded in Motivational
Interviewing (MI) -- a client-centered counseling approach designed to address
ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. CAMI employs a novel STAR
framework, consisting of client's state inference, motivation topic
exploration, and response generation modules, leveraging large language models
(LLMs). These components work together to evoke change talk, aligning with MI
principles and improving counseling outcomes for clients from diverse
backgrounds. We evaluate CAMI's performance through both automated and manual
evaluations, utilizing simulated clients to assess MI skill competency,
client's state inference accuracy, topic exploration proficiency, and overall
counseling success. Results show that CAMI not only outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods but also shows more realistic counselor-like behavior.
Additionally, our ablation study underscores the critical roles of state
inference and topic exploration in achieving this performance.

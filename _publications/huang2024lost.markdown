This study investigates how Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage source and reference data in machine translation evaluation task aiming to better understand the mechanisms behind their remarkable performance in this task. We design the controlled experiments across various input modes and model types and employ both coarse45;grained and fine45;grained prompts to discern the utility of source versus reference information. We find that reference information significantly enhances the evaluation accuracy while surprisingly source information sometimes is counterproductive indicating LLMs inability to fully leverage the cross45;lingual capability when evaluating translations. Further analysis of the fine45;grained evaluation and fine45;tuning experiments show similar results. These findings also suggest a potential research direction for LLMs that fully exploits the cross45;lingual capability of LLMs to achieve better performance in machine translation evaluation tasks.

Digital storytelling, essential in entertainment, education, and marketing,
faces challenges in production scalability and flexibility. The StoryAgent
framework, introduced in this paper, utilizes Large Language Models and
generative tools to automate and refine digital storytelling. Employing a
top-down story drafting and bottom-up asset generation approach, StoryAgent
tackles key issues such as manual intervention, interactive scene
orchestration, and narrative consistency. This framework enables efficient
production of interactive and consistent narratives across multiple modalities,
democratizing content creation and enhancing engagement. Our results
demonstrate the framework's capability to produce coherent digital stories
without reference videos, marking a significant advancement in automated
digital storytelling.

Digital storytelling essential in entertainment education and marketing faces challenges in production scalability and flexibility. The StoryAgent framework introduced in this paper utilizes Large Language Models and generative tools to automate and refine digital storytelling. Employing a top-down story drafting and bottom-up asset generation approach StoryAgent tackles key issues such as manual intervention interactive scene orchestration and narrative consistency. This framework enables efficient production of interactive and consistent narratives across multiple modalities democratizing content creation and enhancing engagement. Our results demonstrate the frameworks capability to produce coherent digital stories without reference videos marking a significant advancement in automated digital storytelling.

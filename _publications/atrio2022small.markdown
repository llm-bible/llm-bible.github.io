We study the role of an essential hyper45;parameter that governs the training of Transformers for neural machine translation in a low45;resource setting the batch size. Using theoretical insights and experimental evidence we argue against the widespread belief that batch size should be set as large as allowed by the memory of the GPUs. We show that in a low45;resource setting a smaller batch size leads to higher scores in a shorter training time and argue that this is due to better regularization of the gradients during training.

This study examines the variability of Chat-GPT machine translation (MT)
outputs across six different configurations in four languages,with a focus on
creativity in a literary text. We evaluate GPT translations in different text
granularity levels, temperature settings and prompting strategies with a
Creativity Score formula. We found that prompting ChatGPT with a minimal
instruction yields the best creative translations, with "Translate the
following text into [TG] creatively" at the temperature of 1.0 outperforming
other configurations and DeepL in Spanish, Dutch, and Chinese. Nonetheless,
ChatGPT consistently underperforms compared to human translation (HT).

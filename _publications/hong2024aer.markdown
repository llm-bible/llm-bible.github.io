Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great
success in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In addition to their
cognitive intelligence, exploring their capabilities in emotional intelligence
is also crucial, as it enables more natural and empathetic conversational AI.
Recent studies have shown LLMs' capability in recognizing emotions, but they
often focus on single emotion labels and overlook the complex and ambiguous
nature of human emotions. This study is the first to address this gap by
exploring the potential of LLMs in recognizing ambiguous emotions, leveraging
their strong generalization capabilities and in-context learning. We design
zero-shot and few-shot prompting and incorporate past dialogue as context
information for ambiguous emotion recognition. Experiments conducted using
three datasets indicate significant potential for LLMs in recognizing ambiguous
emotions, and highlight the substantial benefits of including context
information. Furthermore, our findings indicate that LLMs demonstrate a high
degree of effectiveness in recognizing less ambiguous emotions and exhibit
potential for identifying more ambiguous emotions, paralleling human perceptual
capabilities.

We study open domain dialogue generation with dialogue acts designed to
explain how people engage in social chat. To imitate human behavior, we propose
managing the flow of human-machine interactions with the dialogue acts as
policies. The policies and response generation are jointly learned from
human-human conversations, and the former is further optimized with a
reinforcement learning approach. With the dialogue acts, we achieve significant
improvement over state-of-the-art methods on response quality for given
contexts and dialogue length in both machine-machine simulation and
human-machine conversation.

Today the detection of AI45;generated content is receiving more and more attention. Our idea is to go beyond detection and try to recover the prompt used to generate a text. This paper to the best of our knowledge introduces the first investigation in this particular domain without a closed set of tasks. Our goal is to study if this approach is promising. We experiment with zero45;shot and few45;shot in45;context learning but also with LoRA fine45;tuning. After that we evaluate the benefits of using a semi45;synthetic dataset. For this first study we limit ourselves to text generated by a single model. The results show that it is possible to recover the original prompt with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

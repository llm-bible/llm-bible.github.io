Today the detection of AI-generated content is receiving more and more attention. Our idea is to go beyond detection and try to recover the prompt used to generate a text. This paper to the best of our knowledge introduces the first investigation in this particular domain without a closed set of tasks. Our goal is to study if this approach is promising. We experiment with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning but also with LoRA fine-tuning. After that we evaluate the benefits of using a semi-synthetic dataset. For this first study we limit ourselves to text generated by a single model. The results show that it is possible to recover the original prompt with a reasonable degree of accuracy.

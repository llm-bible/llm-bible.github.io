Today, the detection of AI-generated content is receiving more and more
attention. Our idea is to go beyond detection and try to recover the prompt
used to generate a text. This paper, to the best of our knowledge, introduces
the first investigation in this particular domain without a closed set of
tasks. Our goal is to study if this approach is promising. We experiment with
zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning but also with LoRA fine-tuning.
After that, we evaluate the benefits of using a semi-synthetic dataset. For
this first study, we limit ourselves to text generated by a single model. The
results show that it is possible to recover the original prompt with a
reasonable degree of accuracy.

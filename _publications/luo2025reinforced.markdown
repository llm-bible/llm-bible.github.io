To take advantage of Large Language Model in theorem formalization and proof,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework to iteratively optimize the
pretrained LLM by rolling out next tactics and comparing them with the expected
ones. The experiment results show that it helps to achieve a higher accuracy
compared with directly fine-tuned LLM.

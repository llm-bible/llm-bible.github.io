Domestic service robots (DSRs) are a promising solution to the shortage of home care workers. However one of the main limitations of DSRs is their inability to interact naturally through language. Recently data-driven approaches have been shown to be effective for tackling this limitation; however they often require large-scale datasets which is costly. Based on this background we aim to perform automatic sentence generation of fetching instructions for example Bring me a green tea bottle on the table. This is particularly challenging because appropriate expressions depend on the target object as well as its surroundings. In this paper we propose the attention branch encoder--decoder network (ABEN) to generate sentences from visual inputs. Unlike other approaches the ABEN has multimodal attention branches that use subword-level attention and generate sentences based on subword embeddings. In experiments we compared the ABEN with a baseline method using four standard metrics in image captioning. Results show that the ABEN outperformed the baseline in terms of these metrics.

A rapidly developing application of LLMs in XAI is to convert quantitative
explanations such as SHAP into user-friendly narratives to explain the
decisions made by smaller prediction models. Evaluating the narratives without
relying on human preference studies or surveys is becoming increasingly
important in this field. In this work we propose a framework and explore
several automated metrics to evaluate LLM-generated narratives for explanations
of tabular classification tasks. We apply our approach to compare several
state-of-the-art LLMs across different datasets and prompt types. As a
demonstration of their utility, these metrics allow us to identify new
challenges related to LLM hallucinations for XAI narratives.

This paper explores the innovative application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to promote heritage education, focusing on traditional Scottish curling presented in the game ``Scottish Bonspiel VR''. Our study compares the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots with pre-defined scripted chatbots, evaluating key criteria such as usability, user engagement, and learning outcomes. The results show that LLM-based chatbots significantly improve interactivity and engagement, creating a more dynamic and immersive learning environment. This integration helps document and preserve cultural heritage and enhances dissemination processes, which are crucial for safeguarding intangible cultural heritage (ICH) amid environmental changes. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential of novel technologies in education to provide immersive experiences that foster a deeper appreciation of cultural heritage. These findings support the wider application of LLMs and VR in cultural education to address global challenges and promote sustainable practices to preserve and enhance cultural heritage.

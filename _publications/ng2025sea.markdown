Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dominated much of the artificial
intelligence scene with their ability to process and generate natural
languages. However, the majority of LLM research and development remains
English-centric, leaving low-resource languages such as those in the Southeast
Asian (SEA) region under-represented. To address this representation gap, we
introduce Llama-SEA-LION-v3-8B-IT and Gemma-SEA-LION-v3-9B-IT, two cutting-edge
multilingual LLMs designed for SEA languages. The SEA-LION family of LLMs
supports 11 SEA languages, namely English, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese,
Malay, Thai, Burmese, Lao, Filipino, Tamil, and Khmer. Our work leverages
large-scale multilingual continued pre-training with a comprehensive
post-training regime involving multiple stages of instruction fine-tuning,
alignment, and model merging. Evaluation results on multilingual benchmarks
indicate that our models achieve state-of-the-art performance across LLMs
supporting SEA languages. We open-source the models to benefit the wider SEA
community.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming education, presenting
unprecedented opportunities for personalized learning and streamlined content
creation. However, realizing the full potential of AI in educational settings
necessitates careful consideration of the quality, cognitive depth, and ethical
implications of AI-generated materials. This paper synthesizes insights from
four related studies to propose a comprehensive framework for enhancing
AI-driven educational tools. We integrate cognitive assessment frameworks
(Bloom's Taxonomy and SOLO Taxonomy), linguistic analysis of AI-generated
feedback, and ethical design principles to guide the development of effective
and responsible AI tools. We outline a structured three-phase approach
encompassing cognitive alignment, linguistic feedback integration, and ethical
safeguards. The practical application of this framework is demonstrated through
its integration into OneClickQuiz, an AI-powered Moodle plugin for quiz
generation. This work contributes a comprehensive and actionable guide for
educators, researchers, and developers aiming to harness AI's potential while
upholding pedagogical and ethical standards in educational content generation.

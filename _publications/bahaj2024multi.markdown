Asthma rates have risen globally, driven by environmental and lifestyle
factors. Access to immediate medical care is limited, particularly in
developing countries, necessitating automated support systems. Large Language
Models like ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Gemini have
advanced natural language processing in general and question answering in
particular, however, they are prone to producing factually incorrect responses
(i.e. hallucinations). Retrieval-augmented generation systems, integrating
curated documents, can improve large language models' performance and reduce
the incidence of hallucination. We introduce AsthmaBot, a multi-lingual,
multi-modal retrieval-augmented generation system for asthma support.
Evaluation of an asthma-related frequently asked questions dataset shows
AsthmaBot's efficacy. AsthmaBot has an added interactive and intuitive
interface that integrates different data modalities (text, images, videos) to
make it accessible to the larger public. AsthmaBot is available online via
\url\{asthmabot.datanets.org\}.

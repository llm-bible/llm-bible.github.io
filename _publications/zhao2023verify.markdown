As large language models (LLMs) have become the norm in NLP demonstrating good performance in generation and reasoning tasks one of its most fatal disadvantages is the lack of factual correctness. Generating unfactual texts not only leads to lower performances but also degrades the trust and validity of their applications. Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) prompting improves trust and model performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating interpretable reasoning chains but still suffers from factuality concerns in knowledge45;intensive tasks. In this paper we propose the Verify45;and45;Edit framework for CoT prompting which seeks to increase prediction factuality by post45;editing reasoning chains according to external knowledge. Building on top of GPT45;3 our framework lead to accuracy improvements in multiple open45;domain question45;answering tasks.

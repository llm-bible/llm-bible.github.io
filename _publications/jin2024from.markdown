With the rise of large language models (LLMs), researchers are increasingly
exploring their applications in var ious vertical domains, such as software
engineering. LLMs have achieved remarkable success in areas including code
generation and vulnerability detection. However, they also exhibit numerous
limitations and shortcomings. LLM-based agents, a novel tech nology with the
potential for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), combine LLMs as the core
for decision-making and action-taking, addressing some of the inherent
limitations of LLMs such as lack of autonomy and self-improvement. Despite
numerous studies and surveys exploring the possibility of using LLMs in
software engineering, it lacks a clear distinction between LLMs and LLM based
agents. It is still in its early stage for a unified standard and benchmarking
to qualify an LLM solution as an LLM-based agent in its domain. In this survey,
we broadly investigate the current practice and solutions for LLMs and
LLM-based agents for software engineering. In particular we summarise six key
topics: requirement engineering, code generation, autonomous decision-making,
software design, test generation, and software maintenance. We review and
differentiate the work of LLMs and LLM-based agents from these six topics,
examining their differences and similarities in tasks, benchmarks, and
evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss the models and benchmarks used,
providing a comprehensive analysis of their applications and effectiveness in
software engineering. We anticipate this work will shed some lights on pushing
the boundaries of LLM-based agents in software engineering for future research.

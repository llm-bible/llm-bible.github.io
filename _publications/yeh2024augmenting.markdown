Writing is a well-established practice to support ideation and creativity.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become ubiquitous in providing
different kinds of writing assistance to different writers, LLM-powered writing
systems often fall short in capturing the nuanced personalization and control
necessary for effective support and creative exploration. To address these
challenges, we introduce GhostWriter, an AI-enhanced writing design probe that
enables users to exercise enhanced agency and personalization. GhostWriter
leverages LLMs to implicitly learn the user's intended writing style for
seamless personalization, while exposing explicit teaching moments for style
refinement and reflection. We study 18 participants who use GhostWriter for
editing and creative tasks, observing that it helps users craft personalized
text and empowers them by providing multiple ways to steer system output. Based
on this study, we present insights on people's relationships with AI-assisted
writing and offer design recommendations to promote user agency in similar
co-creative systems.

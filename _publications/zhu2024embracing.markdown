The impressive essay writing and problem-solving capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT have opened up new avenues in
education. Our goal is to gain insights into the widespread use of LLMs among
secondary students to inform their future development. Despite school
restrictions, our survey of over 300 middle and high school students revealed
that a remarkable 70% of students have utilized LLMs, higher than the usage
percentage among young adults, and this percentage remains consistent across
7th to 12th grade. Students also reported using LLMs for multiple subjects,
including language arts, history, and math assignments, but expressed mixed
thoughts on their effectiveness due to occasional hallucinations in historical
contexts and incorrect answers for lack of rigorous reasoning. The survey
feedback called for LLMs better adapted for students, and also raised questions
to developers and educators on how to help students from underserved
communities leverage LLMs' capabilities for equal access to advanced education
resources. We propose a few ideas to address such issues, including
subject-specific models, personalized learning, and AI classrooms.

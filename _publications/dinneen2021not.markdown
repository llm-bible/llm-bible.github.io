AI language models trained on Web data generate prose that reflects human
knowledge and public sentiments, but can also contain novel insights and
predictions. We asked the world's best language model, GPT-3, fifteen difficult
questions about the nature, value, and future of library and information
science (LIS), topics that receive perennial attention from LIS scholars. We
present highlights from its 45 different responses, which range from platitudes
and caricatures to interesting perspectives and worrisome visions of the
future, thus providing an LIS-tailored demonstration of the current performance
of AI language models. We also reflect on the viability of using AI to forecast
or generate research ideas in this way today. Finally, we have shared the full
response log online for readers to consider and evaluate for themselves.

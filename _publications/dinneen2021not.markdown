AI language models trained on Web data generate prose that reflects human knowledge and public sentiments but can also contain novel insights and predictions. We asked the worlds best language model GPT-3 fifteen difficult questions about the nature value and future of library and information science (LIS) topics that receive perennial attention from LIS scholars. We present highlights from its 45 different responses which range from platitudes and caricatures to interesting perspectives and worrisome visions of the future thus providing an LIS-tailored demonstration of the current performance of AI language models. We also reflect on the viability of using AI to forecast or generate research ideas in this way today. Finally we have shared the full response log online for readers to consider and evaluate for themselves.

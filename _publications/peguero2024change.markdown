Recent work in reframing, within the scope of text style transfer, has so far
made use of out-of-context, task-prompted utterances in order to produce
neutralizing or optimistic reframes. Our work aims to generalize reframing
based on the subreddit r/ChangeMyView (CMV). We build a dataset that leverages
CMV's community's interactions and conventions to identify high-value,
community-recognized utterances that produce changes of perspective. With this
data, we widen the scope of the direction of reframing since the changes in
perspective do not only occur in neutral or positive directions. We fine tune
transformer-based models, make use of a modern LLM to refine our dataset, and
explore challenges in the dataset creation and evaluation around this type of
reframing.

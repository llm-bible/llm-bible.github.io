Contemporary embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), such as
Voyager, have shown promising capabilities in individual learning within
open-ended environments like Minecraft. However, when powered by open LLMs,
they struggle with basic tasks even after domain-specific fine-tuning. We
present MindForge, a generative-agent framework for collaborative lifelong
learning through explicit perspective taking. We introduce three key
innovations: (1) a structured theory of mind representation linking percepts,
beliefs, desires, and actions; (2) natural interagent communication; and (3) a
multicomponent memory system. In Minecraft experiments, MindForge agents
powered by open-weight LLMs significantly outperform their Voyager counterparts
in basic tasks where traditional Voyager fails without GPT-4, collecting
\\(2.3\times\\) more unique items and achieving \\(3\times\\) more tech-tree
milestones, advancing from basic wood tools to advanced iron equipment.
MindForge agents demonstrate sophisticated behaviors, including expert-novice
knowledge transfer, collaborative problem solving, and adaptation to
out-of-distribution tasks through accumulated collaborative experiences.
MindForge advances the democratization of embodied AI development through
open-ended social learning, enabling peer-to-peer knowledge sharing.

The current trend to improve language model performance seems to be based on scaling up with the number of parameters (e.g. the state of the art GPT4 model has approximately 1.7 trillion parameters) or the amount of training data fed into the model. However this comes at significant costs in terms of computational resources and energy costs that compromise the sustainability of AI solutions as well as risk relating to privacy and misuse. In this paper we present the Erasmian Language Model (ELM) a small context specific 900 million parameter model pre45;trained and fine45;tuned by and for Erasmus University Rotterdam. We show how the model performs adequately in a classroom context for essay writing and how it achieves superior performance in subjects that are part of its context. This has implications for a wide range of institutions and organizations showing that context specific language models may be a viable alternative for resource constrained privacy sensitive use cases.

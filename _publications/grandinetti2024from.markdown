Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet their application in specialized fields such as medical physics remains challenging due to the need for domain45;specific knowledge. This study introduces ARCoT (Adaptable Retrieval45;based Chain of Thought) a framework designed to enhance the domain45;specific accuracy of LLMs without requiring fine45;tuning or extensive retraining. ARCoT integrates a retrieval mechanism to access relevant domain45;specific information and employs step45;back and chain45;of45;thought prompting techniques to guide the LLMs reasoning process ensuring more accurate and context45;aware responses. Benchmarking on a medical physics multiple45;choice exam our model outperformed standard LLMs and reported average human performance demonstrating improvements of up to 6837; and achieving a high score of 9037;. This method reduces hallucinations and increases domain45;specific performance. The versatility and model45;agnostic nature of ARCoT make it easily adaptable to various domains showcasing its significant potential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in specialized fields.

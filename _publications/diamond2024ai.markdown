For many people anxiety depression and other social and mental factors can make composing text messages an active challenge. To remedy this problem large language models (LLMs) may yet prove to be the perfect tool to assist users that would otherwise find texting difficult or stressful. However despite rapid uptake in LLM usage considerations for their assistive usage in text message composition have not been explored. A primary concern regarding LLM usage is that poor public sentiment regarding AI introduces the possibility that its usage may harm perceptions of AI45;assisted text messages making usage counter45;productive. To (in)validate this possibility we explore how the belief that a text message did or did not receive AI assistance in composition alters its perceived tone clarity and ability to convey intent. In this study we survey the perceptions of 26 participants on 18 randomly labeled pre45;composed text messages. In analyzing the participants ratings of message tone clarity and ability to convey intent we find that there is no statistically significant evidence that the belief that AI is utilized alters recipient perceptions. This provides hopeful evidence that LLM45;based text message composition assistance can be implemented without the risk of counter45;productive outcomes.

Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit positional bias struggling to utilize information from the middle or end of long contexts. Our study explores LLMs long-context reasoning by probing their hidden representations. We find that while LLMs encode the position of target information they often fail to leverage this in generating accurate responses. This reveals a disconnect between information retrieval and utilization a know but dont tell phenomenon. We further analyze the relationship between extraction time and final accuracy offering insights into the underlying mechanics of transformer models.

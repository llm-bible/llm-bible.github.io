We present CharacterChat, a concept and chatbot to support writers in
creating fictional characters. Concretely, writers progressively turn the bot
into their imagined character through conversation. We iteratively developed
CharacterChat in a user-centred approach, starting with a survey on character
creation with writers (N=30), followed by two qualitative user studies (N=7 and
N=8). Our prototype combines two modes: (1) Guided prompts help writers define
character attributes (e.g. User: "Your name is Jane."), including suggestions
for attributes (e.g. Bot: "What is my main motivation?") and values, realised
as a rule-based system with a concept network. (2) Open conversation with the
chatbot helps writers explore their character and get inspiration, realised
with a language model that takes into account the defined character attributes.
Our user studies reveal benefits particularly for early stages of character
creation, and challenges due to limited conversational capabilities. We
conclude with lessons learned and ideas for future work.

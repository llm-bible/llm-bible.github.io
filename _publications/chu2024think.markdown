This study introduces textbf123;InteractEval125; a framework that integrates human expertise and Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Think45;Aloud (TA) method to generate attributes for checklist45;based text evaluation. By combining human flexibility and reasoning with LLM consistency InteractEval outperforms traditional non45;LLM45;based and LLM45;based baselines across four distinct dimensions consisting of Coherence Fluency Consistency and Relevance. The experiment also investigates the effectiveness of the TA method showing that it promotes divergent thinking in both humans and LLMs leading to the generation of a wider range of relevant attributes and enhance text evaluation performance. Comparative analysis reveals that humans excel at identifying attributes related to internal quality (Coherence and Fluency) but LLMs perform better at those attributes related to external alignment (Consistency and Relevance). Consequently leveraging both humans and LLMs together produces the best evaluation outcomes. In other words this study emphasizes the necessity of effectively combining humans and LLMs in an automated checklist45;based text evaluation framework.

Aligning AI with human intent is important, yet perceptual alignment-how AI
interprets what we see, hear, or smell-remains underexplored. This work focuses
on olfaction, human smell experiences. We conducted a user study with 40
participants to investigate how well AI can interpret human descriptions of
scents. Participants performed "sniff and describe" interactive tasks, with our
designed AI system attempting to guess what scent the participants were
experiencing based on their descriptions. These tasks evaluated the Large
Language Model's (LLMs) contextual understanding and representation of scent
relationships within its internal states - high-dimensional embedding space.
Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used to evaluate the AI system's
performance. Results indicated limited perceptual alignment, with biases
towards certain scents, like lemon and peppermint, and continued failing to
identify others, like rosemary. We discuss these findings in light of human-AI
alignment advancements, highlighting the limitations and opportunities for
enhancing HCI systems with multisensory experience integration.

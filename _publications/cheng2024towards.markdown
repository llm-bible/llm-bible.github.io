In this paper we present Cross Language Agent 45;45; Simultaneous Interpretation CLASI a high45;quality and human45;like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters we utilize a novel data45;driven read45;write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in45;domain terminologies CLASI employs a multi45;modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs our approach can generate error45;tolerated translation by considering the input audio historical context and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric valid information proportion (VIP) which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real45;world scenarios where the speeches are often disfluent informal and unclear CLASI achieves VIP of 81.337; and 78.037; for Chinese45;to45;English and English45;to45;Chinese translation directions respectively. In contrast state45;of45;the45;art commercial or open45;source systems only achieve 35.437; and 41.637;. On the extremely hard dataset where other systems achieve under 1337; VIP CLASI can still achieve 7037; VIP.

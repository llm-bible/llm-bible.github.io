Automating code documentation through explanatory text can prove highly
beneficial in code understanding. Large Language Models (LLMs) have made
remarkable strides in Natural Language Processing, especially within software
engineering tasks such as code generation and code summarization. This study
specifically delves into the task of generating natural-language summaries for
code snippets, using various LLMs. The findings indicate that Code LLMs
outperform their generic counterparts, and zero-shot methods yield superior
results when dealing with datasets with dissimilar distributions between
training and testing sets.

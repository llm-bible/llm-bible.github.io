In-context learning (ICL) is a powerful paradigm emerged from large language models (LLMs). Despite its promises ICL performance is known to be highly sensitive to input examples. In this work we use textitin-context influences to analyze few-shot ICL performance directly from the in-context examples. Our proposed influence-based example selection method can identify both positive and negative examples outperforming several baselines when evaluated on 9 SuperGLUE tasks. Our analysis uncovers up to a (16.3) performance gap between using the most negative in-context examples compared to the most positive. In a case study we apply our influence-based framework to quantify the phenomena of recency bias in example ordering for few-shot ICL.

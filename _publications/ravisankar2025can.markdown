Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained predominantly on English text
exhibit surprising multilingual capabilities, yet the mechanisms driving
cross-lingual generalization remain poorly understood. This work investigates
how the alignment of representations for text written in different languages
correlates with LLM performance on natural language understanding tasks and
translation tasks, both at the language and the instance level. For this
purpose, we introduce cross-lingual alignment metrics such as the
Discriminative Alignment Index (DALI) to quantify the alignment at an instance
level for discriminative tasks. Through experiments on three natural language
understanding tasks (Belebele, XStoryCloze, XCOPA), and machine translation, we
find that while cross-lingual alignment metrics strongly correlate with task
accuracy at the language level, the sample-level alignment often fails to
distinguish correct from incorrect predictions, exposing alignment as a
necessary but insufficient condition for success.

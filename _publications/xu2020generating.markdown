Recently open45;domain dialogue systems have attracted growing attention. Most of them use the sequence45;to45;sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture to generate responses. However traditional Seq2Seq45;based open45;domain dialogue models tend to generate generic and safe responses which are less informative unlike human responses. In this paper we propose a simple but effective keywords45;guided Sequence45;to45;Sequence model (KW45;Seq2Seq) which uses keywords information as guidance to generate open45;domain dialogue responses. Specifically KW45;Seq2Seq first uses a keywords decoder to predict some topic keywords and then generates the final response under the guidance of them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the KW45;Seq2Seq model produces more informative coherent and fluent responses yielding substantive gain in both automatic and human evaluation metrics.

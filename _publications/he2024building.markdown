The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to a new era marked by the development of autonomous applications in real45;world scenarios which drives innovation in creating advanced web agents. Existing web agents typically only handle one input modality and are evaluated only in simplified web simulators or static web snapshots greatly limiting their applicability in real45;world scenarios. To bridge this gap we introduce WebVoyager an innovative Large Multimodal Model (LMM) powered web agent that can complete user instructions end45;to45;end by interacting with real45;world websites. Moreover we establish a new benchmark by compiling real45;world tasks from 15 popular websites and introduce an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging multimodal understanding abilities of GPT45;4V to evaluate open45;ended web agents. We show that WebVoyager achieves a 59.137; task success rate on our benchmark significantly surpassing the performance of both GPT45;4 (All Tools) and the WebVoyager (text45;only) setups underscoring the exceptional capability of WebVoyager. The proposed automatic evaluation metric achieves 85.337; agreement with human judgment indicating its effectiveness in providing reliable and accurate assessments of web agents.

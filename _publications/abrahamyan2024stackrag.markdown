Developers spend much time finding information that is relevant to their
questions. Stack Overflow has been the leading resource, and with the advent of
Large Language Models (LLMs), generative models such as ChatGPT are used
frequently. However, there is a catch in using each one separately. Searching
for answers is time-consuming and tedious, as shown by the many tools developed
by researchers to address this issue. On the other, using LLMs is not reliable,
as they might produce irrelevant or unreliable answers (i.e., hallucination).
In this work, we present StackRAG, a retrieval-augmented Multiagent generation
tool based on LLMs that combines the two worlds: aggregating the knowledge from
SO to enhance the reliability of the generated answers. Initial evaluations
show that the generated answers are correct, accurate, relevant, and useful.

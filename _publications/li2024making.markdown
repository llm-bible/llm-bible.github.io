Recent advancements in long-context modeling have enhanced language models (LMs) for complex tasks across multiple NLP applications. Despite this progress we find that these models struggle with multi-hop reasoning and exhibit decreased performance in the presence of noisy contexts. In this paper we introduce Reasoning with Attributions a novel approach that prompts LMs to supply attributions for each assertion during their reasoning. We validate our approach through experiments on three multi-hop datasets employing both proprietary and open-source models and demonstrate its efficacy and resilience. Furthermore we explore methods to augment reasoning capabilities via fine-tuning and offer an attribution-annotated dataset and a specialized training strategy. Our fine-tuned model achieves competitive performance on multi-hop reasoning benchmarks closely paralleling proprietary LMs such as ChatGPT and Claude-instant.

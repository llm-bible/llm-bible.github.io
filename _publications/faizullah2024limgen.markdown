Examining limitations is a crucial step in the scholarly research reviewing process revealing aspects where a study might lack decisiveness or require enhancement. This aids readers in considering broader implications for further research. In this article we present a novel and challenging task of Suggestive Limitation Generation (SLG) for research papers. We compile a dataset called encompassing 4068 research papers and their associated limitations from the ACL anthology. We investigate several approaches to harness large language models (LLMs) for producing suggestive limitations by thoroughly examining the related challenges practical insights and potential opportunities. Our LimGen dataset and code can be accessed at urlhttps://github.com/arbmf/LimGen}.

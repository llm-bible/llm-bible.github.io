Conversation agents fueled by Large Language Models (LLMs) are providing a new way to interact with visual data. While there have been initial attempts for image45;based conversation models this work addresses the under45;explored field of emph123;video45;based conversation125; by introducing Video45;ChatGPT. It is a multimodal model that merges a video45;adapted visual encoder with an LLM. The resulting model is capable of understanding and generating detailed conversations about videos. We introduce a new dataset of 100000 video45;instruction pairs used to train Video45;ChatGPT acquired via manual and semi45;automated pipeline that is easily scalable and robust to label noise. We also develop a quantitative evaluation framework for video45;based dialogue models to objectively analyze the strengths and weaknesses of video45;based dialogue models.

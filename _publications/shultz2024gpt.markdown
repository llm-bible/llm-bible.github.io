We test whether a leading AI system GPT45;4 understands discourse as well as humans do using a standardized test of discourse comprehension. Participants are presented with brief stories and then answer eight yes/no questions probing their comprehension of the story. The questions are formatted to assess the separate impacts of directness (stated vs. implied) and salience (main idea vs. details). GPT45;4 performs slightly but not statistically significantly better than humans given the very high level of human performance. Both GPT45;4 and humans exhibit a strong ability to make inferences about information that is not explicitly stated in a story a critical test of understanding.

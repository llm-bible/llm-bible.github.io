The success of visual instruction tuning has accelerated the development of
large language and vision models (LLVMs). Following the scaling laws of
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), LLVMs either have further
increased their sizes, reaching 26B, 34B, and even 80B parameters. While this
increase in model size has yielded significant performance gains, it demands
substantially more hardware resources for both training and inference.
Consequently, there naturally exists a strong need for efficient LLVMs that
achieve the performance of larger models while being smaller in size. To
achieve this need, we present a new efficient LLVM family with model sizes of
0.5B, 1.8B, 3.8B, and 7B parameters, Phantom, which significantly enhances
learning capabilities within limited structures. By temporarily increasing the
latent hidden dimension during multi-head self-attention (MHSA), we make LLVMs
prepare to look and understand much more vision-language knowledge on the
latent, without substantially increasing physical model sizes. To maximize its
advantage, we introduce Phantom Optimization (PO) using both autoregressive
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO)-like
concept, which effectively follows correct answers while eliminating incorrect
and ambiguous ones. Phantom outperforms numerous larger open- and closed-source
LLVMs, positioning itself as a leading solution in the landscape of efficient
LLVMs.

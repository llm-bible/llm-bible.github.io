The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of
existing papers to create new ideas, and facet-based ideation is an established
framework for idea generation. To see how large language models (LLMs) might
assist in this process, we contribute a novel mixed-initiative ideation tool
called Scideator. Starting from a user-provided set of scientific papers,
Scideator extracts key facets -- purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations -- from
these and related papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by
interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also
helps users gauge idea originality by searching the literature for overlaps,
assessing idea novelty and providing explanations. To support these tasks,
Scideator introduces three LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, and Idea Novelty
Checker. In a within-subjects user study (N=22) with computer-science
researchers comparing Scideator to a strong baseline, our tool provided
significantly more creativity support, particularly with respect to
exploration, which participants considered the most important factor for idea
generation.

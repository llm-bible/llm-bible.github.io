We present a question-and-answer (Q\&A) application designed to support the
contract management process by leveraging combined information from contract
documents (PDFs) and data retrieved from contract management systems
(database). This data is processed by a large language model (LLM) to provide
precise and relevant answers. The accuracy of these responses is further
enhanced through the use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), text-to-SQL
techniques, and agents that dynamically orchestrate the workflow. These
techniques eliminate the need to retrain the language model. Additionally, we
employed Prompt Engineering to fine-tune the focus of responses. Our findings
demonstrate that this multi-agent orchestration and combination of techniques
significantly improve the relevance and accuracy of the answers, offering a
promising direction for future information systems.

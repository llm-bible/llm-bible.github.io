The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing the process
of writing code. General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in
generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot
queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with
recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we
propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines
conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized
programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited
human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated
programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging
from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven
systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's
performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios
in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that
EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the
benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the
backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with
varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to
explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code
generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and
code generation.

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs), there is a profound transformation occurring in the realm of
natural language processing tasks within the legal domain. The capabilities of
LLMs are increasingly demonstrating unique roles in the legal sector, bringing
both distinctive benefits and various challenges. This survey delves into the
synergy between LLMs and the legal system, such as their applications in tasks
like legal text comprehension, case retrieval, and analysis. Furthermore, this
survey highlights key challenges faced by LLMs in the legal domain, including
bias, interpretability, and ethical considerations, as well as how researchers
are addressing these issues. The survey showcases the latest advancements in
fine-tuned legal LLMs tailored for various legal systems, along with legal
datasets available for fine-tuning LLMs in various languages. Additionally, it
proposes directions for future research and development.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to AI advancements,
facilitating applications like predictive text generation. Nonetheless, they
pose risks by potentially memorizing and disseminating sensitive, biased, or
copyrighted information from their vast datasets. Machine unlearning emerges as
a cutting-edge solution to mitigate these concerns, offering techniques for
LLMs to selectively discard certain data. This paper reviews the latest in
machine unlearning for LLMs, introducing methods for the targeted forgetting of
information to address privacy, ethical, and legal challenges without
necessitating full model retraining. It divides existing research into
unlearning from unstructured/textual data and structured/classification data,
showcasing the effectiveness of these approaches in removing specific data
while maintaining model efficacy. Highlighting the practicality of machine
unlearning, this analysis also points out the hurdles in preserving model
integrity, avoiding excessive or insufficient data removal, and ensuring
consistent outputs, underlining the role of machine unlearning in advancing
responsible, ethical AI.

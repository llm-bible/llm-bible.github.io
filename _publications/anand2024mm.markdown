Recent advancements in LLMs have shown their significant potential in tasks like text summarization and generation. Yet they often encounter difficulty while solving complex physics problems that require arithmetic calculation and a good understanding of concepts. Moreover many physics problems include images that contain important details required to understand the problems context. We propose an LMM45;based chatbot to answer multimodal physics MCQs. For domain adaptation we utilize the MM45;PhyQA dataset comprising Indian high school45;level multimodal physics problems. To improve the LMMs performance we experiment with two techniques RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and Image Captioning. In image captioning we add a detailed explanation of the diagram in each image minimizing hallucinations and image processing errors. We further explore the integration of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) methodology inspired by the ranking approach in RLHF to enhance the human45;like problem45;solving abilities of the models. The RLHF approach incorporates human feedback into the learning process of LLMs improving the models problem45;solving skills truthfulness and reasoning capabilities minimizing the hallucinations in the answers and improving the quality instead of using vanilla45;supervised fine45;tuned models. We employ the LLaVA open45;source model to answer multimodal physics MCQs and compare the performance with and without using RLHF.

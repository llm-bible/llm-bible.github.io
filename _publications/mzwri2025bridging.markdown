The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Learning Management
Systems (LMSs) has the potential to enhance task automation and accessibility
in education. However, hallucination where LLMs generate inaccurate or
misleading information remains a significant challenge. This study introduces
the Dynamic Course Content Integration (DCCI) mechanism, which dynamically
retrieves and integrates course content and curriculum from Canvas LMS into the
LLM-powered assistant, Ask ME. By employing prompt engineering to structure
retrieved content within the LLM's context window, DCCI ensures accuracy,
relevance, and contextual alignment, mitigating hallucination. To evaluate
DCCI's effectiveness, Ask ME's usability, and broader student perceptions of AI
in education, a mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating user
satisfaction ratings and a structured survey. Results from a pilot study
indicate high user satisfaction (4.614/5), with students recognizing Ask ME's
ability to provide timely and contextually relevant responses for both
administrative and course-related inquiries. Additionally, a majority of
students agreed that Ask ME's integration with course content in Canvas LMS
reduced platform-switching, improving usability, engagement, and comprehension.
AI's role in reducing classroom hesitation and fostering self-directed learning
and intellectual curiosity was also highlighted. Despite these benefits and
positive perception of AI tools, concerns emerged regarding over-reliance on
AI, accuracy limitations, and ethical issues such as plagiarism and reduced
student-teacher interaction. These findings emphasize the need for strategic AI
implementation, ethical safeguards, and a pedagogical framework that
prioritizes human-AI collaboration over substitution.

We introduce EXAONE 3.0 instruction-tuned language model the first open model in the family of Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by LG AI Research. Among different model sizes we publicly release the 7.8B instruction-tuned model to promote open research and innovations. Through extensive evaluations across a wide range of public and in-house benchmarks EXAONE 3.0 demonstrates highly competitive real-world performance with instruction-following capability against other state-of-the-art open models of similar size. Our comparative analysis shows that EXAONE 3.0 excels particularly in Korean while achieving compelling performance across general tasks and complex reasoning. With its strong real-world effectiveness and bilingual proficiency we hope that EXAONE keeps contributing to advancements in Expert AI. Our EXAONE 3.0 instruction-tuned model is available at https://huggingface.co/LGAI-EXAONE/EXAONE-3.0-7.8B-Instruct"

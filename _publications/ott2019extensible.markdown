fairseq is an open-source sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers
and developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language
modeling, and other text generation tasks. The toolkit is based on PyTorch and
supports distributed training across multiple GPUs and machines. We also
support fast mixed-precision training and inference on modern GPUs. A demo

Phrases are fundamental linguistic units through which humans convey
semantics. This study critically examines the capacity of API-based large
language models (LLMs) to comprehend phrase semantics, utilizing three
human-annotated datasets. We assess the performance of LLMs in executing phrase
semantic reasoning tasks guided by natural language instructions and explore
the impact of common prompting techniques, including few-shot demonstrations
and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our findings reveal that LLMs greatly
outperform traditional embedding methods across the datasets; however, they do
not show a significant advantage over fine-tuned methods. The effectiveness of
advanced prompting strategies shows variability. We conduct detailed error
analyses to interpret the limitations faced by LLMs in comprehending phrase
semantics. Code and data can be found at

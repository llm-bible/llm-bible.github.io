A successful negotiation requires a range of capabilities, including
comprehension of the conversation context, Theory-of-Mind (ToM) skills to infer
the partner's motives, strategic reasoning, and effective communication, making
it challenging for automated systems. Despite the remarkable performance of
LLMs in various NLP tasks, there is no systematic evaluation of their
capabilities in negotiation. Such an evaluation is critical for advancing AI
negotiation agents and negotiation research, ranging from designing dialogue
systems to providing pedagogical feedback and scaling up data collection
practices. This work aims to systematically analyze the multifaceted
capabilities of LLMs across diverse dialogue scenarios throughout the stages of
a typical negotiation interaction. Our analysis highlights GPT-4's superior
performance in many tasks while identifying specific challenges, such as making
subjective assessments and generating contextually appropriate, strategically
advantageous responses.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language
processing across numerous languages and tasks. However, evaluating LLM
performance in a consistent and meaningful way across multiple European
languages remains challenging, especially due to the scarcity of
language-parallel multilingual benchmarks. We introduce a multilingual
evaluation approach tailored for European languages. We employ translated
versions of five widely-used benchmarks to assess the capabilities of 40 LLMs
across 21 European languages. Our contributions include examining the
effectiveness of translated benchmarks, assessing the impact of different
translation services, and offering a multilingual evaluation framework for LLMs
that includes newly created datasets: EU20-MMLU, EU20-HellaSwag, EU20-ARC,
EU20-TruthfulQA, and EU20-GSM8K. The benchmarks and results are made publicly
available to encourage further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

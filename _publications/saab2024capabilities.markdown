Excellence in a wide variety of medical applications poses considerable challenges for AI requiring advanced reasoning access to up-to-date medical knowledge and understanding of complex multimodal data. Gemini models with strong general capabilities in multimodal and long-context reasoning offer exciting possibilities in medicine. Building on these core strengths of Gemini we introduce Med-Gemini a family of highly capable multimodal models that are specialized in medicine with the ability to seamlessly use web search and that can be efficiently tailored to novel modalities using custom encoders. We evaluate Med-Gemini on 14 medical benchmarks establishing new state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on 10 of them and surpass the GPT-4 model family on every benchmark where a direct comparison is viable often by a wide margin. On the popular MedQA (USMLE) benchmark our best-performing Med-Gemini model achieves SoTA performance of 91.137; accuracy using a novel uncertainty-guided search strategy. On 7 multimodal benchmarks including NEJM Image Challenges and MMMU (health amp; medicine) Med-Gemini improves over GPT-4V by an average relative margin of 44.537;. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-Geminis long-context capabilities through SoTA performance on a needle-in-a-haystack retrieval task from long de-identified health records and medical video question answering surpassing prior bespoke methods using only in-context learning. Finally Med-Geminis performance suggests real-world utility by surpassing human experts on tasks such as medical text summarization alongside demonstrations of promising potential for multimodal medical dialogue medical research and education. Taken together our results offer compelling evidence for Med-Geminis potential although further rigorous evaluation will be crucial before real-world deployment in this safety-critical domain.

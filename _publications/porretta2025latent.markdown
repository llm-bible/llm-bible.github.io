Token prediction stability remains a challenge in autoregressive generative
models, where minor variations in early inference steps often lead to
significant semantic drift over extended sequences. A structured modulation
mechanism was introduced to regulate hidden state transitions, ensuring that
latent representation trajectories remain aligned with prior contextual
dependencies while preserving generative flexibility. The modulation framework
was designed to function within transformer-based architectures, dynamically
constraining representation evolution without imposing external memory
dependencies or extensive architectural modifications. Empirical evaluations
demonstrated that structured latent adjustments contributed to reductions in
perplexity fluctuations, entropy variance, and lexical instability, improving
coherence in long-form text generation. Gradient propagation stability was
further analyzed, revealing that the modulation process led to smoother
optimization pathways, mitigating erratic fluctuations in weight updates across
successive inference steps. The computational efficiency of the modulation
process was assessed, showing that its integration within transformer-based
architectures introduced only marginal overhead while maintaining compatibility
with existing optimization frameworks. The structured modulation constraints
also influenced syntactic variation, preventing excessive repetition while
maintaining balanced sentence length distributions. Comparative evaluations
against baseline models reinforced the role of controlled latent state
evolution in improving pronoun resolution, logical consistency, and contextual
alignment across autoregressive text generation tasks.

In the field of Question Answering (QA) unifying large language models (LLMs) with external databases has shown great success. However these methods often fall short in providing the advanced reasoning needed for complex QA tasks. To address these issues we improve over a novel approach called Knowledge Graph Prompting (KGP) which combines knowledge graphs with a LLM45;based agent to improve reasoning and search accuracy. Nevertheless the original KGP framework necessitates costly fine45;tuning with large datasets yet still suffers from LLM hallucination. Therefore we propose a reasoning45;infused LLM agent to enhance this framework. This agent mimics human curiosity to ask follow45;up questions to more efficiently navigate the search. This simple modification significantly boosts the LLM performance in QA tasks without the high costs and latency associated with the initial KGP framework. Our ultimate goal is to further develop this approach leading to more accurate faster and cost45;effective solutions in the QA domain.

Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements and are now widely used across various domains. Unfortunately there has been a rising concern that LLMs can be misused to generate harmful or malicious content. Though a line of research has focused on aligning LLMs with human values and preventing them from producing inappropriate content such alignments are usually vulnerable and can be bypassed by alignment45;breaking attacks via adversarially optimized or handcrafted jailbreaking prompts. In this work we introduce a Robustly Aligned LLM (RA45;LLM) to defend against potential alignment45;breaking attacks. RA45;LLM can be directly constructed upon an existing aligned LLM with a robust alignment checking function without requiring any expensive retraining or fine45;tuning process of the original LLM. Furthermore we also provide a theoretical analysis for RA45;LLM to verify its effectiveness in defending against alignment45;breaking attacks. Through real45;world experiments on open45;source large language models we demonstrate that RA45;LLM can successfully defend against both state45;of45;the45;art adversarial prompts and popular handcrafted jailbreaking prompts by reducing their attack success rates from nearly 10037; to around 1037; or less.

In this position paper, we advocate for the development of conversational
technology that is inherently designed to support and facilitate argumentative
processes. We argue that, at present, large language models (LLMs) are
inadequate for this purpose, and we propose an ideal technology design aimed at
enhancing argumentative skills. This involves re-framing LLMs as tools to
exercise our critical thinking rather than replacing them. We introduce the
concept of 'reasonable parrots' that embody the fundamental principles of
relevance, responsibility, and freedom, and that interact through argumentative
dialogical moves. These principles and moves arise out of millennia of work in
argumentation theory and should serve as the starting point for LLM-based
technology that incorporates basic principles of argumentation.

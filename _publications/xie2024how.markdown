The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in diverse applications
requires a thorough understanding of their decision-making strategies and
behavioral patterns. As a supplement to a recent study on the behavioral Turing
test, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of five leading LLM-based
chatbot families as they navigate a series of behavioral economics games. By
benchmarking these AI chatbots, we aim to uncover and document both common and
distinct behavioral patterns across a range of scenarios. The findings provide
valuable insights into the strategic preferences of each LLM, highlighting
potential implications for their deployment in critical decision-making roles.

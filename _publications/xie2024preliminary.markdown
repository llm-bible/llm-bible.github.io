Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across
various domains and tasks, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge in learning
and cognition. The latest model, OpenAI's o1, stands out as the first LLM with
an internalized chain-of-thought technique using reinforcement learning
strategies. While it has demonstrated surprisingly strong capabilities on
various general language tasks, its performance in specialized fields such as
medicine remains unknown. To this end, this report provides a comprehensive
exploration of o1 on different medical scenarios, examining 3 key aspects:
understanding, reasoning, and multilinguality. Specifically, our evaluation
encompasses 6 tasks using data from 37 medical datasets, including two newly
constructed and more challenging question-answering (QA) tasks based on
professional medical quizzes from the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)
and The Lancet. These datasets offer greater clinical relevance compared to
standard medical QA benchmarks such as MedQA, translating more effectively into
real-world clinical utility. Our analysis of o1 suggests that the enhanced
reasoning ability of LLMs may (significantly) benefit their capability to
understand various medical instructions and reason through complex clinical
scenarios. Notably, o1 surpasses the previous GPT-4 in accuracy by an average
of 6.2% and 6.6% across 19 datasets and two newly created complex QA scenarios.
But meanwhile, we identify several weaknesses in both the model capability and
the existing evaluation protocols, including hallucination, inconsistent
multilingual ability, and discrepant metrics for evaluation. We release our raw
data and model outputs at https://ucsc-vlaa.github.io/o1_medicine/ for future
research.

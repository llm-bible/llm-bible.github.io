With their remarkably improved text generation and prompting capabilities large language models can adapt existing written information into forms that are easier to use and understand. In our work we focus on recipes as an example of complex diverse and widely used instructions. We develop a prompt grounded in the original recipe and ingredients list that breaks recipes down into simpler steps. We apply this prompt to recipes from various world cuisines and experiment with several large language models (LLMs) finding best results with GPT-3.5. We also contribute an Amazon Mechanical Turk task that is carefully designed to reduce fatigue while collecting human judgment of the quality of recipe revisions. We find that annotators usually prefer the revision over the original demonstrating a promising application of LLMs in serving as digital sous chefs for recipes and beyond. We release our prompt code and MTurk template for public use.

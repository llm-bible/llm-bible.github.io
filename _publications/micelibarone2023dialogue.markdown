Simulation is an invaluable tool for developing and evaluating controllers for self-driving cars. Current simulation frameworks are driven by highly-specialist domain specific languages and so a natural language interface would greatly enhance usability. But there is often a gap consisting of tacit assumptions the user is making between a concise English utterance and the executable code that captures the users intent. In this paper we describe a system that addresses this issue by supporting an extended multimodal interaction the user can follow up prior instructions with refinements or revisions in reaction to the simulations that have been generated from their utterances so far. We use Large Language Models (LLMs) to map the users English utterances in this interaction into domain-specific code and so we explore the extent to which LLMs capture the context sensitivity thats necessary for computing the speakers intended message in discourse.

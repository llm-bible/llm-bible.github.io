Large language models (LLMs) with in45;context learning have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities in the cross45;domain text45;to45;SQL task without the use of in45;domain annotations. However incorporating in45;domain demonstration examples has been found to greatly enhance LLMs performance. In this paper we delve into the key factors within in45;domain examples that contribute to the improvement and explore whether we can harness these benefits without relying on in45;domain annotations. Based on our findings we propose a demonstration selection framework ODIS which utilizes both out45;of45;domain examples and synthetically generated in45;domain examples to construct demonstrations. By retrieving demonstrations from hybrid sources ODIS leverages the advantages of both showcasing its effectiveness compared to baseline methods that rely on a single data source. Furthermore ODIS outperforms state45;of45;the45;art approaches on two cross45;domain text45;to45;SQL datasets with improvements of 1.1 and 11.8 points in execution accuracy respectively.

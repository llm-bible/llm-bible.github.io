Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language tasks but
often struggle with long-horizon planning problems requiring structured
reasoning. This limitation has drawn interest in integrating neuro-symbolic
approaches within the Automated Planning (AP) and Natural Language Processing
(NLP) communities. However, identifying optimal AP deployment frameworks can be
daunting. This paper aims to provide a timely survey of the current research
with an in-depth analysis, positioning LLMs as tools for extracting and
refining planning models to support reliable AP planners. By systematically
reviewing the current state of research, we highlight methodologies, and
identify critical challenges and future directions, hoping to contribute to the
joint research on NLP and Automated Planning.

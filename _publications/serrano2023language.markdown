Given the growing importance of AI literacy we decided to write this tutorial to help narrow the gap between the discourse among those who study language models -- the core technology underlying ChatGPT and similar products -- and those who are intrigued and want to learn more about them. In short we believe the perspective of researchers and educators can add some clarity to the publics understanding of the technologies beyond whats currently available which tends to be either extremely technical or promotional material generated about products by their purveyors. Our approach teases apart the concept of a language model from products built on them from the behaviors attributed to or desired from those products and from claims about similarity to human cognition. As a starting point we (1) offer a scientific viewpoint that focuses on questions amenable to study through experimentation; (2) situate language models as they are today in the context of the research that led to their development; and (3) describe the boundaries of what is known about the models at this writing.

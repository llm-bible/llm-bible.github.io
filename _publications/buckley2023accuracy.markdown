Background General45;purpose large language models that utilize both text and images have not been evaluated on a diverse array of challenging medical cases. Methods Using 934 cases from the NEJM Image Challenge published between 2005 and 2023 we evaluated the accuracy of the recently released Generative Pre45;trained Transformer 4 with Vision model (GPT45;4V) compared to human respondents overall and stratified by question difficulty image type and skin tone. We further conducted a physician evaluation of GPT45;4V on 69 NEJM clinicopathological conferences (CPCs). Analyses were conducted for models utilizing text alone images alone and both text and images. Results GPT45;4V achieved an overall accuracy of 6137; (9537; CI 58 to 6437;) compared to 4937; (9537; CI 49 to 5037;) for humans. GPT45;4V outperformed humans at all levels of difficulty and disagreement skin tones and image types; the exception was radiographic images where performance was equivalent between GPT45;4V and human respondents. Longer more informative captions were associated with improved performance for GPT45;4V but similar performance for human respondents. GPT45;4V included the correct diagnosis in its differential for 8037; (9537; CI 68 to 8837;) of CPCs when using text alone compared to 5837; (9537; CI 45 to 7037;) of CPCs when using both images and text. Conclusions GPT45;4V outperformed human respondents on challenging medical cases and was able to synthesize information from both images and text but performance deteriorated when images were added to highly informative text. Overall our results suggest that multimodal AI models may be useful in medical diagnostic reasoning but that their accuracy may depend heavily on context.

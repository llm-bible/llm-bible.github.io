This paper presents exploratory work on whether and to what extent biases against queer and trans people are encoded in large language models (LLMs) such as BERT. We also propose a method for reducing these biases in downstream tasks finetuning the models on data written by and/or about queer people. To measure anti-queer bias we introduce a new benchmark dataset WinoQueer modeled after other bias-detection benchmarks but addressing homophobic and transphobic biases. We found that BERT shows significant homophobic bias but this bias can be mostly mitigated by finetuning BERT on a natural language corpus written by members of the LGBTQ+ community.

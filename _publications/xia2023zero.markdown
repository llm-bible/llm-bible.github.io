Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have been serving as general45;purpose interfaces posing a significant demand for comprehensive visual knowledge. However it remains unclear how well current LLMs and their visually augmented counterparts (VaLMs) can master visual commonsense knowledge. To investigate this we propose ImageNetVC a human45;annotated dataset specifically designed for zero45; and few45;shot visual commonsense evaluation across 1000 ImageNet categories. Utilizing ImageNetVC we benchmark the fundamental visual commonsense knowledge of both unimodal LLMs and VaLMs. Furthermore we analyze the factors affecting the visual commonsense knowledge of large45;scale models providing insights into the development of language models enriched with visual commonsense knowledge. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/hemingkx/ImageNetVC.

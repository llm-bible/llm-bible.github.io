While Large language models (LLMs) have garnered widespread applications across various domains due to their powerful language understanding and generation capabilities the detection of non45;factual or hallucinatory content generated by LLMs remains scarce. Currently one significant challenge in hallucination detection is the laborious task of time45;consuming and expensive manual annotation of the hallucinatory generation. To address this issue this paper first introduces a method for automatically constructing model45;specific hallucination datasets based on existing fact45;checking datasets called AutoHall. Furthermore we propose a zero45;resource and black45;box hallucination detection method based on self45;contradiction. We conduct experiments towards prevalent open45;/closed45;source LLMs achieving superior hallucination detection performance compared to extant baselines. Moreover our experiments reveal variations in hallucination proportions and types among different models.

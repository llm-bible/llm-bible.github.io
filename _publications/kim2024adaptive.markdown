When using large language models (LLMs) in knowledge45;intensive tasks such as open45;domain question answering external context can bridge a gap between external knowledge and LLMs parametric knowledge. Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLM with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open45;domain question answering tasks compared to baselines especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval45;augmented generation.

Electronic health records (EHRs) house crucial patient data in clinical notes. As these notes grow in volume and complexity manual extraction becomes challenging. This work introduces a natural language interface using large language models (LLMs) for dynamic question-answering on clinical notes. Our chatbot powered by Langchain and transformer-based LLMs allows users to query in natural language receiving relevant answers from clinical notes. Experiments utilizing various embedding models and advanced LLMs show Wizard Vicunas superior accuracy albeit with high compute demands. Model optimization including weight quantization improves latency by approximately 48 times. Promising results indicate potential yet challenges such as model hallucinations and limited diverse medical case evaluations remain. Addressing these gaps is crucial for unlocking the value in clinical notes and advancing AI-driven clinical decision-making.

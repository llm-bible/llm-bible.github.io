Recognizing the imperative to address the reliability and transparency issues of Large Language Models (LLM) this work proposes an LLM maturity model tailored for text-to-query applications. This maturity model seeks to fill the existing void in evaluating LLMs in such applications by incorporating dimensions beyond mere correctness or accuracy. Moreover this work introduces a real-world use case from the law enforcement domain and showcases QueryIQ an LLM-powered domain-specific text-to-query assistant to expedite user workflows and reveal hidden relationship in data.

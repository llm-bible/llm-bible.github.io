This paper investigates how human interactions with AI-powered chatbots may
offend human dignity. Current chatbots, driven by large language models (LLMs),
mimic human linguistic behaviour but lack the moral and rational capacities
essential for genuine interpersonal respect. Human beings are prone to
anthropomorphise chatbots. Indeed, chatbots appear to be deliberately designed
to elicit that response. As a result, human beings' behaviour toward chatbots
often resembles behaviours typical of interaction between moral agents. Drawing
on a second-personal, relational account of dignity, we argue that interacting
with chatbots in this way is incompatible with the dignity of users. We show
that, since second-personal respect is premised on reciprocal recognition of
second-personal authority, behaving towards chatbots in ways that convey
second-personal respect is bound to misfire in morally problematic ways, given
the lack of reciprocity. Consequently, such chatbot interactions amount to
subtle but significant violations of self-respect: the respect we are dutybound
to show for our own dignity. We illustrate this by discussing four actual
chatbot use cases (information retrieval, customer service, advising, and
companionship), and propound that the increasing societal pressure to engage in
such interactions with chatbots poses a hitherto underappreciated threat to
human dignity.

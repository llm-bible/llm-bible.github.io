Reference resolution is an important problem one that is essential to understand and successfully handle context of different kinds. This context includes both previous turns and context that pertains to non-conversational entities such as entities on the users screen or those running in the background. While LLMs have been shown to be extremely powerful for a variety of tasks their use in reference resolution particularly for non-conversational entities remains underutilized. This paper demonstrates how LLMs can be used to create an extremely effective system to resolve references of various types by showing how reference resolution can be converted into a language modeling problem despite involving forms of entities like those on screen that are not traditionally conducive to being reduced to a text-only modality. We demonstrate large improvements over an existing system with similar functionality across different types of references with our smallest model obtaining absolute gains of over 537; for on-screen references. We also benchmark against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with our smallest model achieving performance comparable to that of GPT-4 and our larger models substantially outperforming it.

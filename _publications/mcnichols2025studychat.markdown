The widespread availability of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT,
has significantly impacted education, raising both opportunities and
challenges. Students can frequently interact with LLM-powered, interactive
learning tools, but their usage patterns need to be analyzed to ensure ethical
usage of these tools. To better understand how students interact with LLMs in
an academic setting, we introduce \textbf\{StudyChat\}, a publicly available
dataset capturing real-world student interactions with an LLM-powered tutoring
chatbot in a semester-long, university-level artificial intelligence (AI)
course. We deploy a web application that replicates ChatGPT's core
functionalities, and use it to log student interactions with the LLM while
working on programming assignments. We collect 1,197 conversations, which we
annotate using a dialogue act labeling schema inspired by observed interaction
patterns and prior research. Additionally, we analyze these interactions,
highlight behavioral trends, and analyze how specific usage patterns relate to
course outcomes. \textbf\{StudyChat\} provides a rich resource for the learning
sciences and AI in education communities, enabling further research into the
evolving role of LLMs in education.

Recent research has shown that language models exploit `artifacts' in
benchmarks to solve tasks, rather than truly learning them, leading to inflated
model performance. In pursuit of creating better benchmarks, we propose VAIDA,
a novel benchmark creation paradigm for NLP, that focuses on guiding
crowdworkers, an under-explored facet of addressing benchmark idiosyncrasies.
VAIDA facilitates sample correction by providing realtime visual feedback and
recommendations to improve sample quality. Our approach is domain, model, task,
and metric agnostic, and constitutes a paradigm shift for robust, validated,
and dynamic benchmark creation via human-and-metric-in-the-loop workflows. We
evaluate via expert review and a user study with NASA TLX. We find that VAIDA
decreases effort, frustration, mental, and temporal demands of crowdworkers and
analysts, simultaneously increasing the performance of both user groups with a
45.8% decrease in the level of artifacts in created samples. As a by product of
our user study, we observe that created samples are adversarial across models,
leading to decreases of 31.3% (BERT), 22.5% (RoBERTa), 14.98% (GPT-3 fewshot)
in performance.

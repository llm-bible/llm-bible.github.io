Employing Large Language Models (LLMs) for semantic parsing has achieved remarkable success. However we find existing methods fall short in terms of reliability and efficiency when hallucinations are encountered. In this paper we address these challenges with a framework called QueryAgent which solves a question step45;by45;step and performs step45;wise self45;correction. We introduce an environmental feedback45;based self45;correction method called ERASER. Unlike traditional approaches ERASER leverages rich environmental feedback in the intermediate steps to perform selective and differentiated self45;correction only when necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that QueryAgent notably outperforms all previous few45;shot methods using only one example on GrailQA and GraphQ by 7.0 and 15.0 F1. Moreover our approach exhibits superiority in terms of efficiency including runtime query overhead and API invocation costs. By leveraging ERASER we further improve another baseline (i.e. AgentBench) by approximately 10 points revealing the strong transferability of our approach.

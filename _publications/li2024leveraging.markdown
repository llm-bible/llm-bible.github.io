Simulated Patients (SPs) play a crucial role in clinical medical education by providing realistic scenarios for student practice. However the high cost of training and hiring qualified SPs along with the heavy workload and potential risks they face in consistently portraying actual patients limit students access to this type of clinical training. Consequently the integration of computer program45;based simulated patients has emerged as a valuable educational tool in recent years. With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) their exceptional capabilities in conversational artificial intelligence and role45;playing have been demonstrated making them a feasible option for implementing Virtual Simulated Patient (VSP). In this paper we present an integrated model45;agnostic framework called CureFun that harnesses the potential of LLMs in clinical medical education. This framework facilitates natural conversations between students and simulated patients evaluates their dialogue and provides suggestions to enhance students clinical inquiry skills. Through comprehensive evaluations our approach demonstrates more authentic and professional SP45;scenario dialogue flows compared to other LLM45;based chatbots thus proving its proficiency in simulating patients. Additionally leveraging CureFuns evaluation ability we assess several medical LLMs and discuss the possibilities and limitations of using LLMs as virtual doctors from the perspective of their diagnostic abilities.

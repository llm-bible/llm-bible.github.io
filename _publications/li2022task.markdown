We present a system for knowledge graph population with Language Models evaluated on the Knowledge Base Construction from Pre45;trained Language Models (LM45;KBC) challenge at ISWC 2022. Our system involves task45;specific pre45;training to improve LM representation of the masked object tokens prompt decomposition for progressive generation of candidate objects among other methods for higher45;quality retrieval. Our system is the winner of track 1 of the LM45;KBC challenge based on BERT LM; it achieves 55.037; F45;1 score on the hidden test set of the challenge.

Modern language models paradoxically combine unprecedented capability with
persistent vulnerability in that they can draft poetry yet cannot reliably
refuse harmful requests. We reveal this fragility stems not from inadequate
training, but from a fundamental architectural limitation: transformers process
all tokens as equals. Transformers operate as computational democracies,
granting equal voice to all tokens. This is a design tragically unsuited for
AGI, where we cannot risk adversarial "candidates" hijacking the system.
Through formal analysis, we demonstrate that safety instructions fundamentally
lack privileged status in transformer architectures, that they compete with
adversarial inputs in the same computational arena, making robust alignment
through prompting or fine-tuning inherently limited. This "token democracy"
explains why jailbreaks bypass even extensively safety-trained models and why
positional shifts erode prompt effectiveness. Our work systematizes
practitioners' tacit knowledge into an architectural critique, showing current
alignment approaches create mere preferences, not constraints.

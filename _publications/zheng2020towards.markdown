Document45;level machine translation manages to outperform sentence level models by a small margin but have failed to be widely adopted. We argue that previous research did not make a clear use of the global context and propose a new document45;level NMT framework that deliberately models the local context of each sentence with the awareness of the global context of the document in both source and target languages. We specifically design the model to be able to deal with documents containing any number of sentences including single sentences. This unified approach allows our model to be trained elegantly on standard datasets without needing to train on sentence and document level data separately. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms Transformer baselines and previous document45;level NMT models with substantial margins of up to 2.1 BLEU on state45;of45;the45;art baselines. We also provide analyses which show the benefit of context far beyond the neighboring two or three sentences which previous studies have typically incorporated.

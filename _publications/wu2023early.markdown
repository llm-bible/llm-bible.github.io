In this paper we evaluate different abilities of GPT45;4V including visual understanding language understanding visual puzzle solving and understanding of other modalities such as depth thermal video and audio. To estimate GPT45;4Vs performance we manually construct 656 test instances and carefully evaluate the results of GPT45;4V. The highlights of our findings are as follows (1) GPT45;4V exhibits impressive performance on English visual45;centric benchmarks but fails to recognize simple Chinese texts in the images; (2) GPT45;4V shows inconsistent refusal behavior when answering questions related to sensitive traits such as gender race and age; (3) GPT45;4V obtains worse results than GPT45;4 (API) on language understanding tasks including general language understanding benchmarks and visual commonsense knowledge evaluation benchmarks; (4) Few45;shot prompting can improve GPT45;4Vs performance on both visual understanding and language understanding; (5) GPT45;4V struggles to find the nuances between two similar images and solve the easy math picture puzzles; (6) GPT45;4V shows non45;trivial performance on the tasks of similar modalities to image such as video and thermal. Our experimental results reveal the ability and limitations of GPT45;4V and we hope our paper can provide some insights into the application and research of GPT45;4V.

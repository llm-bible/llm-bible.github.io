This paper investigates the impact of verbose LLM translations on evaluation.
We first demonstrate the prevalence of this behavior across several LLM outputs
drawn from the WMT 2024 general shared task on machine translation. We then
identify the primary triggers of verbosity, including safety, copyright
concerns, and insufficient context in short input queries. Finally, we show
that ignoring this behavior unfairly penalizes more verbose LLMs according to
both automatic and human evaluations, highlighting the need to address this
issue for more accurate future evaluations.

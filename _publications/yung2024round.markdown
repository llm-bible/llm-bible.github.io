Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to social45;engineered attacks that are human45;interpretable but require a high level of comprehension for LLMs to counteract. Existing defensive measures can only mitigate less than half of these attacks at most. To address this issue we propose the Round Trip Translation (RTT) method the first algorithm specifically designed to defend against social45;engineered attacks on LLMs. RTT paraphrases the adversarial prompt and generalizes the idea conveyed making it easier for LLMs to detect induced harmful behavior. This method is versatile lightweight and transferrable to different LLMs. Our defense successfully mitigated over 7037; of Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) attacks which is currently the most effective defense to the best of our knowledge. We are also the first to attempt mitigating the MathsAttack and reduced its attack success rate by almost 4037;. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Cancanxxx/Round&#95;Trip&#95;Translation&#95;Defence

The glyphic writing system of Chinese incorporates information-rich visual
features in each character, such as radicals that provide hints about meaning
or pronunciation. However, there has been no investigation into whether
contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
harness these sub-character features in Chinese through prompting. In this
study, we establish a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' and VLMs' understanding of
visual elements in Chinese characters, including radicals, composition
structures, strokes, and stroke counts. Our results reveal that models
surprisingly exhibit some, but still limited, knowledge of the visual
information, regardless of whether images of characters are provided. To incite
models' ability to use radicals, we further experiment with incorporating
radicals into the prompts for Chinese language processing (CLP) tasks. We
observe consistent improvement in Part-Of-Speech tagging when providing
additional information about radicals, suggesting the potential to enhance CLP
by integrating sub-character information.

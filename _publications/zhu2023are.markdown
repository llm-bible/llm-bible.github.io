Narrative understanding involves capturing the authors cognitive processes providing insights into their knowledge intentions beliefs and desires. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in generating grammatically coherent text their ability to comprehend the authors thoughts remains uncertain. This limitation hinders the practical applications of narrative understanding. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive survey of narrative understanding tasks thoroughly examining their key features definitions taxonomy associated datasets training objectives evaluation metrics and limitations. Furthermore we explore the potential of expanding the capabilities of modularized LLMs to address novel narrative understanding tasks. By framing narrative understanding as the retrieval of the authors imaginative cues that outline the narrative structure our study introduces a fresh perspective on enhancing narrative comprehension.

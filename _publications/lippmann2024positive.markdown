Intelligent agents designed for interactive environments face significant
challenges in text-based games, a domain that demands complex reasoning and
adaptability. While agents based on large language models (LLMs) using
self-reflection have shown promise, they struggle when initially successful and
exhibit reduced effectiveness when using smaller LLMs. We introduce Sweet&Sour,
a novel approach that addresses these limitations in existing reflection
methods by incorporating positive experiences and managed memory to enrich the
context available to the agent at decision time. Our comprehensive analysis
spans both closed- and open-source LLMs and demonstrates the effectiveness of
Sweet&Sour in improving agent performance, particularly in scenarios where
previous approaches fall short.

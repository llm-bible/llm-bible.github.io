This study investigates the internal reasoning process of language models
during arithmetic multi-step reasoning, motivated by the question of when they
internally form their answers during reasoning. Particularly, we inspect
whether the answer is determined before or after chain-of-thought (CoT) begins
to determine whether models follow a post-hoc Think-to-Talk mode or a
step-by-step Talk-to-Think mode of explanation. Through causal probing
experiments in controlled arithmetic reasoning tasks, we found systematic
internal reasoning patterns across models in our case study; for example,
single-step subproblems are solved before CoT begins, and more complicated
multi-step calculations are performed during CoT.

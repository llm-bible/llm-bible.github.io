Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and
LLaMA, have significantly transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) with
their outstanding abilities in text generation, summarization, and
classification. Nevertheless, their widespread adoption introduces numerous
challenges, including issues related to academic integrity, copyright,
environmental impacts, and ethical considerations such as data bias, fairness,
and privacy. The rapid evolution of LLMs also raises concerns regarding the
reliability and generalizability of their evaluations. This paper offers a
comprehensive survey of the literature on these subjects, systematically
gathered and synthesized from Google Scholar. Our study provides an in-depth
analysis of the risks associated with specific LLMs, identifying sub-risks,
their causes, and potential solutions. Furthermore, we explore the broader
challenges related to LLMs, detailing their causes and proposing mitigation
strategies. Through this literature analysis, our survey aims to deepen the
understanding of the implications and complexities surrounding these powerful
models.

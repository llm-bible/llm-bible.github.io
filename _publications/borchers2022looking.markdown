The growing capability and availability of generative language models has enabled a wide range of new downstream tasks. Academic research has identified quantified and mitigated biases present in language models but is rarely tailored to downstream tasks where wider impact on individuals and society can be felt. In this work we leverage one popular generative language model GPT45;3 with the goal of writing unbiased and realistic job advertisements. We first assess the bias and realism of zero45;shot generated advertisements and compare them to real45;world advertisements. We then evaluate prompt45;engineering and fine45;tuning as debiasing methods. We find that prompt45;engineering with diversity45;encouraging prompts gives no significant improvement to bias nor realism. Conversely fine45;tuning especially on unbiased real advertisements can improve realism and reduce bias.

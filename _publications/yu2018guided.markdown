Recently there has been a rising interest in training agents, embodied in
virtual environments, to perform language-directed tasks by deep reinforcement
learning. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective neural language
grounding module for embodied agents that can be trained end to end from
scratch taking raw pixels, unstructured linguistic commands, and sparse rewards
as the inputs. We model the language grounding process as a language-guided
transformation of visual features, where latent sentence embeddings are used as
the transformation matrices. In several language-directed navigation tasks that
feature challenging partial observability and require simple reasoning, our
module significantly outperforms the state of the art. We also release
XWorld3D, an easy-to-customize 3D environment that can potentially be modified
to evaluate a variety of embodied agents.

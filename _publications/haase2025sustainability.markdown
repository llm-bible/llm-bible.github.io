Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly embedded in
organizational workflows. This has raised concerns over their energy
consumption, financial costs, and data sovereignty. While performance
benchmarks often celebrate cutting-edge models, real-world deployment decisions
require a broader perspective: when is a smaller, locally deployable model
"good enough"? This study offers an empirical answer by evaluating eleven
proprietary and open-weight LLMs across ten everyday occupational tasks,
including summarizing texts, generating schedules, and drafting emails and
proposals. Using a dual-LLM-based evaluation framework, we automated task
execution and standardized evaluation across ten criteria related to output
quality, factual accuracy, and ethical responsibility. Results show that GPT-4o
delivers consistently superior performance but at a significantly higher cost
and environmental footprint. Notably, smaller models like Gemma-3 and Phi-4
achieved strong and reliable results on most tasks, suggesting their viability
in contexts requiring cost-efficiency, local deployment, or privacy. A cluster
analysis revealed three model groups -- premium all-rounders, competent
generalists, and limited but safe performers -- highlighting trade-offs between
quality, control, and sustainability. Significantly, task type influenced model
effectiveness: conceptual tasks challenged most models, while aggregation and
transformation tasks yielded better performances. We argue for a shift from
performance-maximizing benchmarks to task- and context-aware sufficiency
assessments that better reflect organizational priorities. Our approach
contributes a scalable method to evaluate AI models through a sustainability
lens and offers actionable guidance for responsible LLM deployment in practice.

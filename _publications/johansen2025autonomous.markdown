Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have facilitated
autonomous AI agents capable of imitating human-generated content. This
technological advancement raises fundamental questions about AI's impact on the
diversity and democratic value of information ecosystems. We introduce a
large-scale simulation framework to examine AI-based imitation within news, a
context crucial for public discourse. By systematically testing two distinct
imitation strategies across a range of information environments varying in
initial diversity, we demonstrate that AI-generated articles do not uniformly
homogenize content. Instead, AI's influence is strongly context-dependent:
AI-generated content can introduce valuable diversity in originally homogeneous
news environments but diminish diversity in initially heterogeneous contexts.
These results illustrate that the initial diversity of an information
environment critically shapes AI's impact, challenging assumptions that
AI-driven imitation threatens diversity. Instead, when information is initially
homogeneous, AI-driven imitation can expand perspectives, styles, and topics.
This is especially important in news contexts, where information diversity
fosters richer public debate by exposing citizens to alternative viewpoints,
challenging biases, and preventing narrative monopolies, which is essential for
a resilient democracy.

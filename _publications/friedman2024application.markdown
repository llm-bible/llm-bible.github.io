In recent years, Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in the field of natural language processing (NLP). This paper
explores the application of LLMs in negotiation transcript analysis by the
Vanderbilt AI Negotiation Lab. Starting in September 2022, we applied multiple
strategies using LLMs from zero shot learning to fine tuning models to
in-context learning). The final strategy we developed is explained, along with
how to access and use the model. This study provides a sense of both the
opportunities and roadblocks for the implementation of LLMs in real life
applications and offers a model for how LLMs can be applied to coding in other
fields.

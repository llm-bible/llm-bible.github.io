The large language model called ChatGPT has drawn extensively attention because of its human45;like expression and reasoning abilities. In this study we investigate the feasibility of using ChatGPT in experiments on using ChatGPT to translate radiology reports into plain language for patients and healthcare providers so that they are educated for improved healthcare. Radiology reports from 62 low45;dose chest CT lung cancer screening scans and 76 brain MRI metastases screening scans were collected in the first half of February for this study. According to the evaluation by radiologists ChatGPT can successfully translate radiology reports into plain language with an average score of 4.27 in the five45;point system with 0.08 places of information missing and 0.07 places of misinformation. In terms of the suggestions provided by ChatGPT they are general relevant such as keeping following45;up with doctors and closely monitoring any symptoms and for about 3737; of 138 cases in total ChatGPT offers specific suggestions based on findings in the report. ChatGPT also presents some randomness in its responses with occasionally over45;simplified or neglected information which can be mitigated using a more detailed prompt. Furthermore ChatGPT results are compared with a newly released large model GPT45;4 showing that GPT45;4 can significantly improve the quality of translated reports. Our results show that it is feasible to utilize large language models in clinical education and further efforts are needed to address limitations and maximize their potential.

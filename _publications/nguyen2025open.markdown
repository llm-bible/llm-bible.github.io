Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated substantial potential in
addressing complex reasoning tasks, yet their general-purpose nature often
limits their effectiveness in specialized domains such as maritime navigation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Llamarine, the first open-source LLM designed
specifically for maritime navigation. Llamarine 1.0 is developed through
continued pretraining and fine-tuning on a high-quality corpus comprising
maritime textbooks, research publications, and web text from Wikipedia. This
domain-specific training enables the model to acquire expert-level knowledge in
navigational principles, collision avoidance, route optimization, and
regulatory compliance. Our key contributions include (a) the curation of a
comprehensive maritime dataset from authoritative sources, ensuring depth and
reliability in the model's knowledge base; (b) the development of a
foundational model capable of reasoning about complex navigational challenges
with greater accuracy than general-purpose LLMs; and (c) the establishment of a
benchmark to evaluate performance in maritime-specific decision-making tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that Llamarine outperforms both
general-purpose and commercial LLMs in critical navigation-related tasks, such
as trajectory planning, risk assessment, and compliance with maritime
regulations. By providing an open-source foundation model trained exclusively
on high-quality maritime literature, Llamarine paves the way for AI-driven
advancements in maritime safety, efficiency, and operational decision-making.

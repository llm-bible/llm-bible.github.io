Post-editing machine translation (MT) for creative texts, such as literature,
requires balancing efficiency with the preservation of creativity and style.
While neural MT systems struggle with these challenges, large language models
(LLMs) offer improved capabilities for context-aware and creative translation.
This study evaluates the feasibility of post-editing literary translations
generated by LLMs. Using a custom research tool, we collaborated with
professional literary translators to analyze editing time, quality, and
creativity. Our results indicate that post-editing LLM-generated translations
significantly reduces editing time compared to human translation while
maintaining a similar level of creativity. The minimal difference in creativity
between PE and MT, combined with substantial productivity gains, suggests that
LLMs may effectively support literary translators working with high-resource
languages.

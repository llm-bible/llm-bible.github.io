The paper investigates using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automatically perform web software tasks using click scroll and text input operations. Previous approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL) or imitation learning are inefficient to train and task45;specific. Our method uses filtered Document Object Model (DOM) elements as observations and performs tasks step45;by45;step sequentially generating small programs based on the current observations. We use in45;context learning either benefiting from a single manually provided example or an automatically generated example based on a successful zero45;shot trial. We evaluate the proposed method on the MiniWob++ benchmark. With only one in45;context example our WebWISE method achieves similar or better performance than other methods that require many demonstrations or trials.

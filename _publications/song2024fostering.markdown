Expressing stressful experiences in words is proven to improve mental and
physical health, but individuals often disengage with writing interventions as
they struggle to organize their thoughts and emotions. Reflective prompts have
been used to provide direction, and large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated the potential to provide tailored guidance. However, current
systems often limit users' flexibility to direct their reflections. We thus
present ExploreSelf, an LLM-driven application designed to empower users to
control their reflective journey, providing adaptive support through
dynamically generated questions. Through an exploratory study with 19
participants, we examine how participants explore and reflect on personal
challenges using ExploreSelf. Our findings demonstrate that participants valued
the flexible navigation of adaptive guidance to control their reflective
journey, leading to deeper engagement and insight. Building on our findings, we
discuss the implications of designing LLM-driven tools that facilitate
user-driven and effective reflection of personal challenges.

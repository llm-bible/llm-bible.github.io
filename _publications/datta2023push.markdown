Deployed artificial intelligence (AI) often impacts humans and there is no one45;size45;fits45;all metric to evaluate these tools. Human45;centered evaluation of AI45;based systems combines quantitative and qualitative analysis and human input. It has been explored to some depth in the explainable AI (XAI) and human45;computer interaction (HCI) communities. Gaps remain but the basic understanding that humans interact with AI and accompanying explanations and that humans needs 45;45; complete with their cognitive biases and quirks 45;45; should be held front and center is accepted by the community. In this paper we draw parallels between the relatively mature field of XAI and the rapidly evolving research boom around large language models (LLMs). Accepted evaluative metrics for LLMs are not human45;centered. We argue that many of the same paths tread by the XAI community over the past decade will be retread when discussing LLMs. Specifically we argue that humans tendencies 45;45; again complete with their cognitive biases and quirks 45;45; should rest front and center when evaluating deployed LLMs. We outline three developed focus areas of human45;centered evaluation of XAI mental models use case utility and cognitive engagement and we highlight the importance of exploring each of these concepts for LLMs. Our goal is to jumpstart human45;centered LLM evaluation.

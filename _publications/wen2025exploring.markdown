Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in
automating the process of visualization authoring through simple natural
language utterances. However, instructing LLMs using natural language is
limited in precision and expressiveness for conveying visualization intent,
leading to misinterpretation and time-consuming iterations. To address these
limitations, we conduct an empirical study to understand how LLMs interpret
ambiguous or incomplete text prompts in the context of visualization authoring,
and the conditions making LLMs misinterpret user intent. Informed by the
findings, we introduce visual prompts as a complementary input modality to text
prompts, which help clarify user intent and improve LLMs' interpretation
abilities. To explore the potential of multimodal prompting in visualization
authoring, we design VisPilot, which enables users to easily create
visualizations using multimodal prompts, including text, sketches, and direct
manipulations on existing visualizations. Through two case studies and a
controlled user study, we demonstrate that VisPilot provides a more intuitive
way to create visualizations without affecting the overall task efficiency
compared to text-only prompting approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the impact
of text and visual prompts in different visualization tasks. Our findings
highlight the importance of multimodal prompting in improving the usability of
LLMs for visualization authoring. We discuss design implications for future
visualization systems and provide insights into how multimodal prompts can
enhance human-AI collaboration in creative visualization tasks. All materials

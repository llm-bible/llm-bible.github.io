To address intricate real45;world tasks there has been a rising interest in tool utilization in applications of large language models (LLMs). To develop LLM45;based agents it usually requires LLMs to understand many tool functions from different tool documentation. But these documentations could be diverse redundant or incomplete which immensely affects the capability of LLMs in using tools. To solve this we introduce EASYTOOL a framework transforming diverse and lengthy tool documentation into a unified and concise tool instruction for easier tool usage. EasyTool purifies essential information from extensive tool documentation of different sources and elaborates a unified interface (i.e. tool instruction) to offer standardized tool descriptions and functionalities for LLM45;based agents. Extensive experiments on multiple different tasks demonstrate that EasyTool can significantly reduce token consumption and improve the performance of tool utilization in real45;world scenarios. Our code will be available at url123;https://github.com/microsoft/JARVIS/&#125; in the future.

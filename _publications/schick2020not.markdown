When scaled to hundreds of billions of parameters pretrained language models such as GPT45;3 (Brown et al. 2020) achieve remarkable few45;shot performance. However enormous amounts of compute are required for training and applying such big models resulting in a large carbon footprint and making it difficult for researchers and practitioners to use them. We show that performance similar to GPT45;3 can be obtained with language models that are much greener in that their parameter count is several orders of magnitude smaller. This is achieved by converting textual inputs into cloze questions that contain a task description combined with gradient45;based optimization; exploiting unlabeled data gives further improvements. We identify key factors required for successful natural language understanding with small language models.

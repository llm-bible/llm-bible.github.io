Narrative understanding and story generation are critical challenges in
natural language processing (NLP), with much of the existing research focused
on summarization and question-answering tasks. While previous studies have
explored predicting plot endings and generating extended narratives, they often
neglect the logical coherence within stories, leaving a significant gap in the
field. To address this, we introduce the Missing Logic Detector by Emotion and
Action (MLD-EA) model, which leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify
narrative gaps and generate coherent sentences that integrate seamlessly with
the story's emotional and logical flow. The experimental results demonstrate
that the MLD-EA model enhances narrative understanding and story generation,
highlighting LLMs' potential as effective logic checkers in story writing with
logical coherence and emotional consistency. This work fills a gap in NLP
research and advances border goals of creating more sophisticated and reliable
story-generation systems.

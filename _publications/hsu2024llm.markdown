Objectives: Despite the recent adoption of large language models (LLMs) for
biomedical information extraction, challenges in prompt engineering and
algorithms persist, with no dedicated software available. To address this, we
developed LLM-IE: a Python package for building complete information extraction
pipelines. Our key innovation is an interactive LLM agent to support schema
definition and prompt design.
  Materials and Methods: The LLM-IE supports named entity recognition, entity
attribute extraction, and relation extraction tasks. We benchmarked on the i2b2
datasets and conducted a system evaluation.
  Results: The sentence-based prompting algorithm resulted in the best
performance while requiring a longer inference time. System evaluation provided
intuitive visualization.
  Discussion: LLM-IE was designed from practical NLP experience in healthcare
and has been adopted in internal projects. It should hold great value to the
biomedical NLP community.
  Conclusion: We developed a Python package, LLM-IE, that provides building
blocks for robust information extraction pipeline construction.

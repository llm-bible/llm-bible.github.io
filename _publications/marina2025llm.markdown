Large Language Models~(LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps mitigate this, but at a high
computational cost while risking misinformation. Adaptive retrieval aims to
retrieve only when necessary, but existing approaches rely on LLM-based
uncertainty estimation, which remain inefficient and impractical. In this
study, we introduce lightweight LLM-independent adaptive retrieval methods
based on external information. We investigated 27 features, organized into 7
groups, and their hybrid combinations. We evaluated these methods on 6 QA
datasets, assessing the QA performance and efficiency. The results show that
our approach matches the performance of complex LLM-based methods while
achieving significant efficiency gains, demonstrating the potential of external
information for adaptive retrieval.

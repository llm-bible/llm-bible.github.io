Previous research has shown that humans are more receptive towards language
models that that exhibit empathetic behavior. While empathy is essential for
developing helpful dialogue agents, very few large corpora containing
empathetic dialogues are available for fine-tune LLMs. The few existing corpora
have largely relied on crowdsourcing to simulate empathetic conversations, a
process that is expensive, time-consuming, and not scalable to larger datasets.
We propose a data generation framework for developing SYNTHEMPATHY, a large
corpus containing 105k empathetic responses to real-life situations compiled
through LLM generation. A base Mistral 7B model fine-tuned on our SYNTHEMPATHY
corpus exhibits an increase in the average empathy score.

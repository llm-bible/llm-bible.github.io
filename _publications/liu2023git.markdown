Large language models have made significant strides in natural language
processing, enabling innovative applications in molecular science by processing
textual representations of molecules. However, most existing language models
cannot capture the rich information with complex molecular structures or
images. In this paper, we introduce GIT-Mol, a multi-modal large language model
that integrates the Graph, Image, and Text information. To facilitate the
integration of multi-modal molecular data, we propose GIT-Former, a novel
architecture that is capable of aligning all modalities into a unified latent
space. We achieve a 5%-10% accuracy increase in properties prediction and a
20.2% boost in molecule generation validity compared to the baselines. With the
any-to-language molecular translation strategy, our model has the potential to
perform more downstream tasks, such as compound name recognition and chemical
reaction prediction.

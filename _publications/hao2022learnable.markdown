Sequential Recommendation aims to predict the next item based on user behaviour. Recently Self45;Supervised Learning (SSL) has been proposed to improve recommendation performance. However most of existing SSL methods use a uniform data augmentation scheme which loses the sequence correlation of an original sequence. To this end in this paper we propose a Learnable Model Augmentation self45;supervised learning for sequential Recommendation (LMA4Rec). Specifically LMA4Rec first takes model augmentation as a supplementary method for data augmentation to generate views. Then LMA4Rec uses learnable Bernoulli dropout to implement model augmentation learnable operations. Next self45;supervised learning is used between the contrastive views to extract self45;supervised signals from an original sequence. Finally experiments on three public datasets show that the LMA4Rec method effectively improves sequential recommendation performance compared with baseline methods.

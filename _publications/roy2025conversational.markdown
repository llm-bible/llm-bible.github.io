This study introduces a system leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to
extract text and enhance user interaction with PDF documents via a
conversational interface. Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the
system provides informative responses to user inquiries while highlighting
relevant passages within the PDF. Upon user upload, the system processes the
PDF, employing sentence embeddings to create a document-specific vector store.
This vector store enables efficient retrieval of pertinent sections in response
to user queries. The LLM then engages in a conversational exchange, using the
retrieved information to extract text and generate comprehensive, contextually
aware answers. While our approach demonstrates competitive ROUGE values
compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques for text extraction and
summarization, we acknowledge that further qualitative evaluation is necessary
to fully assess its effectiveness in real-world applications. The proposed
system gives competitive ROUGE values as compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques for text extraction and summarization, thus offering a valuable tool
for researchers, students, and anyone seeking to efficiently extract knowledge
and gain insights from documents through an intuitive question-answering
interface.

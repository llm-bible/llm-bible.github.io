LLMs are increasingly being deployed for multilingual applications and have
demonstrated impressive translation capabilities between several low and
high-resource languages. An aspect of translation that often gets overlooked is
that of cultural adaptation, or modifying source culture references to suit the
target culture. While specialized translation models still outperform LLMs on
the machine translation task when viewed from the lens of correctness, they are
not sensitive to cultural differences often requiring manual correction. LLMs
on the other hand have a rich reservoir of cultural knowledge embedded within
its parameters that can be potentially exploited for such applications. In this
paper, we define the task of cultural adaptation and create an evaluation
framework to evaluate the performance of modern LLMs for cultural adaptation
and analyze their cross-cultural knowledge while connecting related concepts
across different cultures. We also analyze possible issues with automatic
adaptation. We hope that this task will offer more insight into the cultural
understanding of LLMs and their creativity in cross-cultural scenarios.

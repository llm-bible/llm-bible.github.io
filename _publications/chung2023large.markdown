Large language models (LLMs) have been used for diverse tasks in natural language processing (NLP) yet remain under45;explored for task45;oriented dialogue systems (TODS) especially for end45;to45;end TODS. We present InstructTODS a novel off45;the45;shelf framework for zero45;shot end45;to45;end task45;oriented dialogue systems that can adapt to diverse domains without fine45;tuning. By leveraging LLMs InstructTODS generates a proxy belief state that seamlessly translates user intentions into dynamic queries for efficient interaction with any KB. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructTODS achieves comparable performance to fully fine45;tuned TODS in guiding dialogues to successful completion without prior knowledge or task45;specific data. Furthermore a rigorous human evaluation of end45;to45;end TODS shows that InstructTODS produces dialogue responses that notably outperform both the gold responses and the state45;of45;the45;art TODS in terms of helpfulness informativeness and humanness. Moreover the effectiveness of LLMs in TODS is further supported by our comprehensive evaluations on TODS subtasks dialogue state tracking intent classification and response generation.

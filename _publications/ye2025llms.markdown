While recent efforts have begun integrating large language models (LLMs) into
foreign language education (FLE), they often rely on traditional approaches to
learning tasks without fully embracing educational methodologies, thus lacking
adaptability to language learning. To address this gap, we argue that LLMs have
the potential to serve as effective tutors in FLE. Specifically, LLMs can play
three critical roles: (1) as data enhancers, improving the creation of learning
materials or serving as student simulations; (2) as task predictors, serving as
learner assessment or optimizing learning pathway; and (3) as agents, enabling
personalized and inclusive education. We encourage interdisciplinary research
to explore these roles, fostering innovation while addressing challenges and
risks, ultimately advancing FLE through the thoughtful integration of LLMs.

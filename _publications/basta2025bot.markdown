We present "Bot Wars," a framework using Large Language Models (LLMs)
scam-baiters to counter phone scams through simulated adversarial dialogues.
Our key contribution is a formal foundation for strategy emergence through
chain-of-thought reasoning without explicit optimization. Through a novel
two-layer prompt architecture, our framework enables LLMs to craft
demographically authentic victim personas while maintaining strategic
coherence. We evaluate our approach using a dataset of 3,200 scam dialogues
validated against 179 hours of human scam-baiting interactions, demonstrating
its effectiveness in capturing complex adversarial dynamics. Our systematic
evaluation through cognitive, quantitative, and content-specific metrics shows
that GPT-4 excels in dialogue naturalness and persona authenticity, while
Deepseek demonstrates superior engagement sustainability.

Genetic programming (GP) has the potential to generate explainable results especially when used for dimensionality reduction. In this research we investigate the potential of leveraging eXplainable AI (XAI) and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT to improve the interpretability of GP45;based non45;linear dimensionality reduction. Our study introduces a novel XAI dashboard named GP4NLDR the first approach to combine state45;of45;the45;art GP with an LLM45;powered chatbot to provide comprehensive user45;centred explanations. We showcase the systems ability to provide intuitive and insightful narratives on high45;dimensional data reduction processes through case studies. Our study highlights the importance of prompt engineering in eliciting accurate and pertinent responses from LLMs. We also address important considerations around data privacy hallucinatory outputs and the rapid advancements in generative AI. Our findings demonstrate its potential in advancing the explainability of GP algorithms. This opens the door for future research into explaining GP models with LLMs.

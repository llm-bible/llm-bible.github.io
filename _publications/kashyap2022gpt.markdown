Recent work has demonstrated substantial gains in pre45;training large45;language models (LLMs) followed by supervised fine45;tuning on the downstream task. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the GPT45;neo model using 6 commonsense reasoning benchmark tasks. We aim to examine the performance of smaller models using the GPT45;neo models against several larger model baselines such as GPT45;3 Llama45;2 MPT and Falcon. Upon fine45;tuning with the appropriate set of hyperparameters our model achieves competitive accuracy on several tasks. We also investigate and substantiate our results using attention45;head visualization to better understand the model performance. Finally we conduct various robustness tests using various methods to gauge the model performance under numerous settings.

This report presents Sabi\'a-3, our new flagship language model, and
Sabiazinho-3, a more cost-effective sibling. The models were trained on a large
brazilian-centric corpus. Evaluations across diverse professional and academic
benchmarks show a strong performance on Portuguese and Brazil-related tasks.
Sabi\'a-3 shows large improvements in comparison to our previous best of model,
Sabia-2 Medium, especially in reasoning-intensive tasks. Notably, Sabi\'a-3's
average performance matches frontier LLMs, while it is offered at a three to
four times lower cost per token, reinforcing the benefits of domain
specialization.

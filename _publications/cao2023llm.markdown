A significant application of Large Language Models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, is
their deployment as chat agents, which respond to human inquiries across a
variety of domains. While current LLMs proficiently answer general questions,
they often fall short in complex diagnostic scenarios such as legal, medical,
or other specialized consultations. These scenarios typically require
Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD), where an AI chat agent must proactively pose
questions and guide users toward specific goals or task completion. Previous
fine-tuning models have underperformed in TOD and the full potential of
conversational capability in current LLMs has not yet been fully explored. In
this paper, we introduce DiagGPT (Dialogue in Diagnosis GPT), an innovative
approach that extends LLMs to more TOD scenarios. In addition to guiding users
to complete tasks, DiagGPT can effectively manage the status of all topics
throughout the dialogue development. This feature enhances user experience and
offers a more flexible interaction in TOD. Our experiments demonstrate that
DiagGPT exhibits outstanding performance in conducting TOD with users, showing
its potential for practical applications in various fields.

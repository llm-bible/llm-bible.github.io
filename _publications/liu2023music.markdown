Text45;to45;music generation (T2M45;Gen) faces a major obstacle due to the scarcity of large45;scale publicly available music datasets with natural language captions. To address this we propose the Music Understanding LLaMA (MU45;LLaMA) capable of answering music45;related questions and generating captions for music files. Our model utilizes audio representations from a pretrained MERT model to extract music features. However obtaining a suitable dataset for training the MU45;LLaMA model remains challenging as existing publicly accessible audio question answering datasets lack the necessary depth for open45;ended music question answering. To fill this gap we present a methodology for generating question45;answer pairs from existing audio captioning datasets and introduce the MusicQA Dataset designed for answering open45;ended music45;related questions. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed MU45;LLaMA model trained on our designed MusicQA dataset achieves outstanding performance in both music question answering and music caption generation across various metrics outperforming current state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) models in both fields and offering a promising advancement in the T2M45;Gen research field.

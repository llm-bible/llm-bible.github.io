We present DeepSeek-VL an open-source Vision-Language (VL) Model designed for real-world vision and language understanding applications. Our approach is structured around three key dimensions We strive to ensure our data is diverse scalable and extensively covers real-world scenarios including web screenshots PDFs OCR charts and knowledge-based content aiming for a comprehensive representation of practical contexts. Further we create a use case taxonomy from real user scenarios and construct an instruction tuning dataset accordingly. The fine-tuning with this dataset substantially improves the models user experience in practical applications. Considering efficiency and the demands of most real-world scenarios DeepSeek-VL incorporates a hybrid vision encoder that efficiently processes high-resolution images (1024 x 1024) while maintaining a relatively low computational overhead. This design choice ensures the models ability to capture critical semantic and detailed information across various visual tasks. We posit that a proficient Vision-Language Model should foremost possess strong language abilities. To ensure the preservation of LLM capabilities during pretraining we investigate an effective VL pretraining strategy by integrating LLM training from the beginning and carefully managing the competitive dynamics observed between vision and language modalities. The DeepSeek-VL family (both 1.3B and 7B models) showcases superior user experiences as a vision-language chatbot in real-world applications achieving state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of visual-language benchmarks at the same model size while maintaining robust performance on language-centric benchmarks. We have made both 1.3B and 7B models publicly accessible to foster innovations based on this foundation model.

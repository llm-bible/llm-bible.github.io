Users interacting with voice assistants today need to phrase their requests
in a very specific manner to elicit an appropriate response. This limits the
user experience, and is partly due to the lack of reasoning capabilities of
dialogue platforms and the hand-crafted rules that require extensive labor. One
possible way to improve user experience and relieve the manual efforts of
designers is to build an end-to-end dialogue system that can do reasoning
itself while perceiving user's utterances. In this work, we propose a novel
method to incorporate the knowledge reasoning capability into dialogue systems
in a more scalable and generalizable manner. Our proposed method allows a
single transformer model to directly walk on a large-scale knowledge graph to
generate responses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
have transformer models generate responses by reasoning over differentiable
knowledge graphs. We investigate the reasoning abilities of the proposed method
on both task-oriented and domain-specific chit-chat dialogues. Empirical
results show that this method can effectively and efficiently incorporate a
knowledge graph into a dialogue system with fully-interpretable reasoning
paths.

The introduction of large language models has significantly advanced code generation. However open45;source models often lack the execution capabilities and iterative refinement of advanced systems like the GPT45;4 Code Interpreter. To address this we introduce OpenCodeInterpreter a family of open45;source code systems designed for generating executing and iteratively refining code. Supported by Code45;Feedback a dataset featuring 68K multi45;turn interactions OpenCodeInterpreter integrates execution and human feedback for dynamic code refinement. Our comprehensive evaluation of OpenCodeInterpreter across key benchmarks such as HumanEval MBPP and their enhanced versions from EvalPlus reveals its exceptional performance. Notably OpenCodeInterpreter45;33B achieves an accuracy of 83.2 (76.4) on the average (and plus versions) of HumanEval and MBPP closely rivaling GPT45;4s 84.2 (76.2) and further elevates to 91.6 (84.6) with synthesized human feedback from GPT45;4. OpenCodeInterpreter brings the gap between open45;source code generation models and proprietary systems like GPT45;4 Code Interpreter.

Text-to-Image(T2I) models typically deploy safety filters to prevent the
generation of sensitive images. Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack
methods manually design prompts for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts,
which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images,
exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's
limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods
require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their
practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A),
which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating
adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the
post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example
synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial
prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations.
Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to
understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we
incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning
process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt
length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further
enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show
that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries
than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack
transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.

This paper presents BARKPLUG V.2 a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot system built using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines to enhance the user experience and access to information within academic settings.The objective of BARKPLUG V.2 is to provide information to users about various campus resources including academic departments programs campus facilities and student resources at a university setting in an interactive fashion. Our system leverages university data as an external data corpus and ingests it into our RAG pipelines for domain-specific question-answering tasks. We evaluate the effectiveness of our system in generating accurate and pertinent responses for Mississippi State University as a case study using quantitative measures employing frameworks such as Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment(RAGAS). Furthermore we evaluate the usability of this system via subjective satisfaction surveys using the System Usability Scale (SUS). Our system demonstrates impressive quantitative performance with a mean RAGAS score of 0.96 and experience as validated by usability assessments.

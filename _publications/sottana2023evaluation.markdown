Large Language Models (LLMs) evaluation is a patchy and inconsistent landscape and it is becoming clear that the quality of automatic evaluation metrics is not keeping up with the pace of development of generative models. We aim to improve the understanding of current models performance by providing a preliminary and hybrid evaluation on a range of open and closed-source generative LLMs on three NLP benchmarks text summarisation text simplification and grammatical error correction (GEC) using both automatic and human evaluation. We also explore the potential of the recently released GPT-4 to act as an evaluator. We find that ChatGPT consistently outperforms many other popular models according to human reviewers on the majority of metrics while scoring much more poorly when using classic automatic evaluation metrics. We also find that human reviewers rate the gold reference as much worse than the best models outputs indicating the poor quality of many popular benchmarks. Finally we find that GPT-4 is capable of ranking models outputs in a way which aligns reasonably closely to human judgement despite task-specific variations with a lower alignment in the GEC task.

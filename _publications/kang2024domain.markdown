Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization capabilities on specific tasks with human45;written instruction data. However the limited quantity diversity and professional expertise of such instruction data raise concerns about the performance of LLMs in psychotherapy tasks when provided with domain45;specific instructions. To address this we firstly propose Domain45;Specific Assistant Instructions based on AlexanderStreet therapy and secondly we use an adaption fine45;tuning method and retrieval augmented generation method to improve pre45;trained LLMs. Through quantitative evaluation of linguistic quality using automatic and human evaluation we observe that pre45;trained LLMs on Psychotherapy Assistant Instructions outperform state45;of45;the45;art LLMs response baselines. Our Assistant45;Instruction approach offers a half45;annotation method to align pre45;trained LLMs with instructions and provide pre45;trained LLMs with more psychotherapy knowledge.

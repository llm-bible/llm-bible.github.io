We propose a natural language prompt45;based retrieval augmented generation (Prompt45;RAG) a novel approach to enhance the performance of generative large language models (LLMs) in niche domains. Conventional RAG methods mostly require vector embeddings yet the suitability of generic LLM45;based embedding representations for specialized domains remains uncertain. To explore and exemplify this point we compared vector embeddings from Korean Medicine (KM) and Conventional Medicine (CM) documents finding that KM document embeddings correlated more with token overlaps and less with human45;assessed document relatedness in contrast to CM embeddings. Prompt45;RAG distinct from conventional RAG models operates without the need for embedding vectors. Its performance was assessed through a Question45;Answering (QA) chatbot application where responses were evaluated for relevance readability and informativeness. The results showed that Prompt45;RAG outperformed existing models including ChatGPT and conventional vector embedding45;based RAGs in terms of relevance and informativeness. Despite challenges like content structuring and response latency the advancements in LLMs are expected to encourage the use of Prompt45;RAG making it a promising tool for other domains in need of RAG methods.

The increasing availability of large-scale datasets has fueled rapid progress
across many scientific fields, creating unprecedented opportunities for
research and discovery while posing significant analytical challenges. Recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) and AI agents have opened new
possibilities for human-AI collaboration, offering powerful tools to navigate
this complex research landscape. In this paper, we introduce SciSciGPT, an
open-source, prototype AI collaborator that uses the science of science as a
testbed to explore the potential of LLM-powered research tools. SciSciGPT
automates complex workflows, supports diverse analytical approaches,
accelerates research prototyping and iteration, and facilitates
reproducibility. Through case studies, we demonstrate its ability to streamline
a wide range of empirical and analytical research tasks while highlighting its
broader potential to advance research. We further propose an LLM Agent
capability maturity model for human-AI collaboration, envisioning a roadmap to
further improve and expand upon frameworks like SciSciGPT. As AI capabilities
continue to evolve, frameworks like SciSciGPT may play increasingly pivotal
roles in scientific research and discovery, unlocking further opportunities. At
the same time, these new advances also raise critical challenges, from ensuring
transparency and ethical use to balancing human and AI contributions.
Addressing these issues may shape the future of scientific inquiry and inform
how we train the next generation of scientists to thrive in an increasingly
AI-integrated research ecosystem.

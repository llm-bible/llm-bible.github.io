The swift progress and ubiquitous adoption of Generative AI (GAI) Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have spurred queries about their ethical application use and disclosure in scholarly research and scientific productions. A few publishers and journals have recently created their own sets of rules; however the absence of a unified approach may lead to a Babel Tower Effect potentially resulting in confusion rather than desired standardization. In response to this we present the ChatGPT Generative Artificial Intelligence and Natural Large Language Models for Accountable Reporting and Use Guidelines (CANGARU) initiative with the aim of fostering a cross-disciplinary global inclusive consensus on the ethical use disclosure and proper reporting of GAI/GPT/LLM technologies in academia. The present protocol consists of four distinct parts a) an ongoing systematic review of GAI/GPT/LLM applications to understand the linked ideas findings and reporting standards in scholarly research and to formulate guidelines for its use and disclosure b) a bibliometric analysis of existing author guidelines in journals that mention GAI/GPT/LLM with the goal of evaluating existing guidelines analyzing the disparity in their recommendations and identifying common rules that can be brought into the Delphi consensus process c) a Delphi survey to establish agreement on the items for the guidelines ensuring principled GAI/GPT/LLM use disclosure and reporting in academia and d) the subsequent development and dissemination of the finalized guidelines and their supplementary explanation and elaboration documents.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have impacted the writing process, enhancing
productivity by collaborating with humans in content creation platforms.
However, generating high-quality, user-aligned text to satisfy real-world
content creation needs remains challenging. We propose WritingPath, a framework
that uses explicit outlines to guide LLMs in generating goal-oriented,
high-quality text. Our approach draws inspiration from structured writing
planning and reasoning paths, focusing on reflecting user intentions throughout
the writing process. To validate our approach in real-world scenarios, we
construct a diverse dataset from unstructured blog posts to benchmark writing
performance and introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework assessing the
quality of outlines and generated texts. Our evaluations with various LLMs
demonstrate that the WritingPath approach significantly enhances text quality
according to evaluations by both LLMs and professional writers.

While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in diagnostic dialogue,
their capabilities for effective management reasoning - including disease
progression, therapeutic response, and safe medication prescription - remain
under-explored. We advance the previously demonstrated diagnostic capabilities
of the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE) through a new LLM-based
agentic system optimised for clinical management and dialogue, incorporating
reasoning over the evolution of disease and multiple patient visit encounters,
response to therapy, and professional competence in medication prescription. To
ground its reasoning in authoritative clinical knowledge, AMIE leverages
Gemini's long-context capabilities, combining in-context retrieval with
structured reasoning to align its output with relevant and up-to-date clinical
practice guidelines and drug formularies. In a randomized, blinded virtual
Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) study, AMIE was compared to 21
primary care physicians (PCPs) across 100 multi-visit case scenarios designed
to reflect UK NICE Guidance and BMJ Best Practice guidelines. AMIE was
non-inferior to PCPs in management reasoning as assessed by specialist
physicians and scored better in both preciseness of treatments and
investigations, and in its alignment with and grounding of management plans in
clinical guidelines. To benchmark medication reasoning, we developed RxQA, a
multiple-choice question benchmark derived from two national drug formularies
(US, UK) and validated by board-certified pharmacists. While AMIE and PCPs both
benefited from the ability to access external drug information, AMIE
outperformed PCPs on higher difficulty questions. While further research would
be needed before real-world translation, AMIE's strong performance across
evaluations marks a significant step towards conversational AI as a tool in
disease management.

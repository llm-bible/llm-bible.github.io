We survey a current, heated debate in the AI research community on whether
large pre-trained language models can be said to "understand" language -- and
the physical and social situations language encodes -- in any important sense.
We describe arguments that have been made for and against such understanding,
and key questions for the broader sciences of intelligence that have arisen in
light of these arguments. We contend that a new science of intelligence can be
developed that will provide insight into distinct modes of understanding, their
strengths and limitations, and the challenge of integrating diverse forms of
cognition.

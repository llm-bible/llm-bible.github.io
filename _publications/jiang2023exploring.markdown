Large language models (LLMs) have recently soared in popularity due to their ease of access and the unprecedented ability to synthesize text responses to diverse user questions. However LLMs like ChatGPT present significant limitations in supporting complex information tasks due to the insufficient affordances of the text45;based medium and linear conversational structure. Through a formative study with ten participants we found that LLM interfaces often present long45;winded responses making it difficult for people to quickly comprehend and interact flexibly with various pieces of information particularly during more complex tasks. We present Graphologue an interactive system that converts text45;based responses from LLMs into graphical diagrams to facilitate information45;seeking and question45;answering tasks. Graphologue employs novel prompting strategies and interface designs to extract entities and relationships from LLM responses and constructs node45;link diagrams in real45;time. Further users can interact with the diagrams to flexibly adjust the graphical presentation and to submit context45;specific prompts to obtain more information. Utilizing diagrams Graphologue enables graphical non45;linear dialogues between humans and LLMs facilitating information exploration organization and comprehension.

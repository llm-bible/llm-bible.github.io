ChatGPT is built on a large language model trained on an enormous corpus of
human text to emulate human conversation. Despite lacking any explicit
programming regarding the laws of physics, recent work has demonstrated that
GPT-3.5 could pass an introductory physics course at some nominal level and
register something close to a minimal understanding of Newtonian Mechanics on
the Force Concept Inventory. This work replicates those results and also
demonstrates that the latest version, GPT-4, has reached a much higher mark in
the latter context. Indeed, its responses come quite close to perfectly
demonstrating expert-level competence, with a few very notable exceptions and
limitations. We briefly comment on the implications of this for the future of
physics education and pedagogy.

Financial analysis heavily relies on the evaluation of earnings reports to
gain insights into company performance. Traditional generation of these reports
requires extensive financial expertise and is time-consuming. With the
impressive progress in Large Language Models (LLMs), a wide variety of
financially focused LLMs has emerged, addressing tasks like sentiment analysis
and entity recognition in the financial domain. This paper presents a novel
challenge: developing an LLM specifically for automating the generation of
earnings reports analysis. Our methodology involves an in-depth analysis of
existing earnings reports followed by a unique approach to fine-tune an LLM for
this purpose. This approach combines retrieval augmentation and the generation
of instruction-based data, specifically tailored for the financial sector, to
enhance the LLM's performance. With extensive financial documents, we construct
financial instruction data, enabling the refined adaptation of our LLM to
financial contexts. Preliminary results indicate that our augmented LLM
outperforms general open-source models and rivals commercial counterparts like
GPT-3.5 in financial applications. Our research paves the way for streamlined
and insightful automation in financial report generation, marking a significant
stride in the field of financial analysis.

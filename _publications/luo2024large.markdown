Pretrained language models like BERT and T5 serve as crucial backbone encoders for dense retrieval. However these models often exhibit limited generalization capabilities and face challenges in improving in domain accuracy. Recent research has explored using large language models (LLMs) as retrievers achieving SOTA performance across various tasks. Despite these advancements the specific benefits of LLMs over traditional retrievers and the impact of different LLM configurations such as parameter sizes pretraining duration and alignment processes on retrieval tasks remain unclear. In this work we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on a wide range of retrieval tasks including in domain accuracy data efficiency zero shot generalization lengthy retrieval instruction based retrieval and multi task learning. We evaluate over 15 different backbone LLMs and non LLMs. Our findings reveal that larger models and extensive pretraining consistently enhance in domain accuracy and data efficiency. Additionally larger models demonstrate significant potential in zero shot generalization lengthy retrieval instruction based retrieval and multi task learning. These results underscore the advantages of LLMs as versatile and effective backbone encoders in dense retrieval providing valuable insights for future research and development in this field.

We present an outline of the first large language model (LLM) based chatbot
application in the context of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for
diabetic retinopathy. By utilizing the capabilities of current LLMs, we enable
patients to provide feedback about their quality of life and treatment progress
via an interactive application. The proposed framework offers significant
advantages over the current approach, which encompasses only qualitative
collection of survey data or a static survey with limited answer options. Using
the PROBot LLM-PROM application, patients will be asked tailored questions
about their individual challenges, and can give more detailed feedback on the
progress of their treatment. Based on this input, we will use machine learning
to infer conventional PROM scores, which can be used by clinicians to evaluate
the treatment status. The goal of the application is to improve adherence to
the healthcare system and treatments, and thus ultimately reduce cases of
subsequent vision impairment. The approach needs to be further validated using
a survey and a clinical study.

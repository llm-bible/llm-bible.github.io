In recent years, we are seeing considerable interest in conversational agents
with the rise of large language models (LLMs). Although they offer considerable
advantages, LLMs also present significant risks, such as hallucination, which
hinder their widespread deployment in industry. Moreover, low-resource
languages such as African ones are still underrepresented in these systems
limiting their performance in these languages. In this paper, we illustrate a
more classical approach based on modular architectures of Task-oriented Dialog
Systems (ToDS) offering better control over outputs. We propose a chatbot
generation engine based on the Rasa framework and a robust methodology for
projecting annotations onto the Wolof language using an in-house machine
translation system. After evaluating a generated chatbot trained on the Amazon
Massive dataset, our Wolof Intent Classifier performs similarly to the one
obtained for French, which is a resource-rich language. We also show that this
approach is extensible to other low-resource languages, thanks to the intent
classifier's language-agnostic pipeline, simplifying the design of chatbots in
these languages.

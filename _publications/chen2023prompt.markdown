Artificial intelligence has made significant progress in natural language processing with models like GPT-3 demonstrating impressive capabilities. However these models still have limitations when it comes to complex tasks that require an understanding of the user such as mastering human comedy writing strategies. This paper explores humor generation using GPT-3 by modeling human comedy writing theory and leveraging step-by-step thinking instructions. In addition we explore the role of cognitive distance in creating humor.

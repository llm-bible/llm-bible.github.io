In this paper we introduce a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) system inspired by the philosophical and psychoanalytical concept of imagination as a Re45;construction of Experiences. Our AI system is equipped with an imagination45;inspired module that bridges the gap between textual inputs and other modalities enriching the derived information based on previously learned experiences. A unique feature of our system is its ability to formulate independent perceptions of inputs. This leads to unique interpretations of a concept that may differ from human interpretations but are equally valid a phenomenon we term as Interpretable Misunderstanding. We employ large45;scale models specifically a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) enabling our proposed system to extract meaningful information across modalities while primarily remaining unimodal. We evaluated our system against other large language models across multiple tasks including emotion recognition and question45;answering using a zero45;shot methodology to ensure an unbiased scenario that may happen by fine45;tuning. Significantly our system outperformed the best Large Language Models (LLM) on the MELD IEMOCAP and CoQA datasets achieving Weighted F1 (WF1) scores of 46.7437; 25.2337; and Overall F1 (OF1) score of 1737; respectively compared to 22.8937; 12.2837; and 737; from the well45;performing LLM. The goal is to go beyond the statistical view of language processing and tie it to human concepts such as philosophy and psychoanalysis. This work represents a significant advancement in the development of imagination45;inspired AI systems opening new possibilities for AI to generate deep and interpretable information across modalities thereby enhancing human45;AI interaction.

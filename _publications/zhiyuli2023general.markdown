With the continuous development and change exhibited by large language model (LLM) technology represented by generative pretrained transformers (GPTs) many classic scenarios in various fields have re-emerged with new opportunities. This paper takes ChatGPT as the modeling object incorporates LLM technology into the typical book resource understanding and recommendation scenario for the first time and puts it into practice. By building a ChatGPT-like book recommendation system (BookGPT) framework based on ChatGPT this paper attempts to apply ChatGPT to recommendation modeling for three typical tasks book rating recommendation user rating recommendation and book summary recommendation and explores the feasibility of LLM technology in book recommendation scenarios. At the same time based on different evaluation schemes for book recommendation tasks and the existing classic recommendation models this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the BookGPT in book recommendation scenarios and analyzes the opportunities and improvement directions for subsequent LLMs in these scenarios.

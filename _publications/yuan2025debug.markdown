Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for coding tasks,
yet in most scenarios it is assumed that all relevant information can be either
accessed in context or matches their training data. We posit that LLMs can
benefit from the ability to interactively explore a codebase to gather the
information relevant to their task. To achieve this, we present a textual
environment, namely debug-gym, for developing LLM-based agents in an
interactive coding setting. Our environment is lightweight and provides a
preset of useful tools, such as a Python debugger (pdb), designed to facilitate
an LLM-based agent's interactive debugging. Beyond coding and debugging tasks,
this approach can be generalized to other tasks that would benefit from
information-seeking behavior by an LLM agent.

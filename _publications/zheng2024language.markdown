Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in everyday life and
research. One of the most common use cases is conversational interactions,
enabled by the language generation capabilities of LLMs. Just as between two
humans, a conversation between an LLM-powered entity and a human depends on the
personality of the conversants. However, measuring the personality of a given
LLM is currently a challenge. This paper introduces the Language Model
Linguistic Personality Assessment (LMLPA), a system designed to evaluate the
linguistic personalities of LLMs. Our system helps to understand LLMs' language
generation capabilities by quantitatively assessing the distinct personality
traits reflected in their linguistic outputs. Unlike traditional human-centric
psychometrics, the LMLPA adapts a personality assessment questionnaire,
specifically the Big Five Inventory, to align with the operational capabilities
of LLMs, and also incorporates the findings from previous language-based
personality measurement literature. To mitigate sensitivity to the order of
options, our questionnaire is designed to be open-ended, resulting in textual
answers. Thus, the AI rater is needed to transform ambiguous personality
information from text responses into clear numerical indicators of personality
traits. Utilising Principal Component Analysis and reliability validations, our
findings demonstrate that LLMs possess distinct personality traits that can be
effectively quantified by the LMLPA. This research contributes to
Human-Computer Interaction and Human-Centered AI, providing a robust framework
for future studies to refine AI personality assessments and expand their
applications in multiple areas, including education and manufacturing.

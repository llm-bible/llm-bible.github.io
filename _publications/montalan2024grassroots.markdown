Multilingual large language models (LLMs) today may not necessarily provide
culturally appropriate and relevant responses to its Filipino users. We
introduce Kalahi, a cultural LLM evaluation suite collaboratively created by
native Filipino speakers. It is composed of 150 high-quality, handcrafted and
nuanced prompts that test LLMs for generations that are relevant to shared
Filipino cultural knowledge and values. Strong LLM performance in Kalahi
indicates a model's ability to generate responses similar to what an average
Filipino would say or do in a given situation. We conducted experiments on LLMs
with multilingual and Filipino language support. Results show that Kalahi,
while trivial for Filipinos, is challenging for LLMs, with the best model
answering only 46.0% of the questions correctly compared to native Filipino
performance of 89.10%. Thus, Kalahi can be used to accurately and reliably
evaluate Filipino cultural representation in LLMs.

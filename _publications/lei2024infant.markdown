Despite the impressive capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they
currently exhibit two primary limitations,
\textbf\{\uppercase\expandafter\{\romannumeral 1\}\}: They struggle to
\textbf\{autonomously solve the real world engineering problem\}.
\textbf\{\uppercase\expandafter\{\romannumeral 2\}\}: They remain
\textbf\{challenged in reasoning through complex logic problems\}. To address
these challenges, we developed the \textsc\{Infant Agent\}, integrating
task-aware functions, operators, a hierarchical management system, and a memory
retrieval mechanism. Together, these components enable large language models to
sustain extended reasoning processes and handle complex, multi-step tasks
efficiently, all while significantly reducing API costs. Using the
\textsc\{Infant Agent\}, GPT-4o's accuracy on the SWE-bench-lite dataset rises
from \\(\mathbf\{0.33%\}\\) to \\(\mathbf\{30%\}\\), and in the AIME-2024 mathematics
competition, it increases GPT-4o's accuracy from \\(\mathbf\{13.3%\}\\) to
\\(\mathbf\{37%\}\\).

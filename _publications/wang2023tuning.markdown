Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the LLaMA model, have demonstrated
their effectiveness in various general-domain natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. Nevertheless, LLMs have not yet performed optimally in biomedical domain
tasks due to the need for medical expertise in the responses. In response to
this challenge, we propose HuaTuo, a LLaMA-based model that has been
supervised-fine-tuned with generated QA (Question-Answer) instances. The
experimental results demonstrate that HuaTuo generates responses that possess
more reliable medical knowledge. Our proposed HuaTuo model is accessible at

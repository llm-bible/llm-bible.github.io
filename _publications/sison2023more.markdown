This article explores the ethical problems arising from the use of ChatGPT as
a kind of generative AI and suggests responses based on the Human-Centered
Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) framework. The HCAI framework is appropriate
because it understands technology above all as a tool to empower, augment, and
enhance human agency while referring to human wellbeing as a grand challenge,
thus perfectly aligning itself with ethics, the science of human flourishing.
Further, HCAI provides objectives, principles, procedures, and structures for
reliable, safe, and trustworthy AI which we apply to our ChatGPT assessments.
The main danger ChatGPT presents is the propensity to be used as a weapon of
mass deception (WMD) and an enabler of criminal activities involving deceit. We
review technical specifications to better comprehend its potentials and
limitations. We then suggest both technical (watermarking, styleme, detectors,
and fact-checkers) and non-technical measures (terms of use, transparency,
educator considerations, HITL) to mitigate ChatGPT misuse or abuse and
recommend best uses (creative writing, non-creative writing, teaching and
learning). We conclude with considerations regarding the role of humans in
ensuring the proper use of ChatGPT for individual and social wellbeing.

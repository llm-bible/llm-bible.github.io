Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various contexts, yet
remain prone to generating non-factual content, commonly referred to as
"hallucinations". The literature categorizes hallucinations into several types,
including entity-level, relation-level, and sentence-level hallucinations.
However, existing hallucination datasets often fail to capture fine-grained
hallucinations in multilingual settings. In this work, we introduce
HalluVerse25, a multilingual LLM hallucination dataset that categorizes
fine-grained hallucinations in English, Arabic, and Turkish. Our dataset
construction pipeline uses an LLM to inject hallucinations into factual
biographical sentences, followed by a rigorous human annotation process to
ensure data quality. We evaluate several LLMs on HalluVerse25, providing
valuable insights into how proprietary models perform in detecting
LLM-generated hallucinations across different contexts.

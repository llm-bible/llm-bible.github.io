Despite readily memorizing world knowledge about entities pre45;trained language models (LMs) struggle to compose together two or more facts to perform multi45;hop reasoning in question45;answering tasks. In this work we propose techniques that improve upon this limitation by relying on random walks over structured knowledge graphs. Specifically we use soft prompts to guide LMs to chain together their encoded knowledge by learning to map multi45;hop questions to random walk paths that lead to the answer. Applying our methods on two T5 LMs shows substantial improvements over standard tuning approaches in answering questions that require 245;hop reasoning.

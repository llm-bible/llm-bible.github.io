This paper presents a comparative study of large language models (LLMs) in interpreting grid-structured geospatial data. We evaluate the performance of a base model through structured prompting and contrast it with a fine-tuned variant trained on a dataset of user-assistant interactions. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of zero-shot prompting and demonstrate the benefits of fine-tuning for structured geospatial and temporal reasoning.

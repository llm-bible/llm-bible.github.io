Art appreciation is vital in nurturing critical thinking and emotional intelligence among learners. However traditional art appreciation education has often been hindered by limited access to art resources especially for disadvantaged students and an imbalanced emphasis on STEM subjects in mainstream education. In response to these challenges recent technological advancements have paved the way for innovative solutions. This study explores the application of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) in art appreciation education focusing on developing LLaVA-Docent a model that leverages these advancements. Our approach involved a comprehensive literature review and consultations with experts in the field leading to developing a robust data framework. Utilizing this framework we generated a virtual dialogue dataset that was leveraged by GPT-4. This dataset was instrumental in training the MLLM named LLaVA-Docent. Six researchers conducted quantitative and qualitative evaluations of LLaVA-Docent to assess its effectiveness benchmarking it against the GPT-4 model in a few-shot setting. The evaluation process revealed distinct strengths and weaknesses of the LLaVA-Docent model. Our findings highlight the efficacy of LLaVA-Docent in enhancing the accessibility and engagement of art appreciation education. By harnessing the potential of MLLMs this study makes a significant contribution to the field of art education proposing a novel methodology that reimagines the way art appreciation is taught and experienced.

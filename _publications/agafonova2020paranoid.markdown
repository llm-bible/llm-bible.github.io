This papers revisits the receptive theory in context of computational
creativity. It presents a case study of a Paranoid Transformer - a fully
autonomous text generation engine with raw output that could be read as the
narrative of a mad digital persona without any additional human post-filtering.
We describe technical details of the generative system, provide examples of
output and discuss the impact of receptive theory, chance discovery and
simulation of fringe mental state on the understanding of computational
creativity.

Recently, sequential recommendation has emerged as a widely studied topic.
Existing researches mainly design effective neural architectures to model user
behavior sequences based on item IDs. However, this kind of approach highly
relies on user-item interaction data and neglects the attribute- or
characteristic-level correlations among similar items preferred by a user. In
light of these issues, we propose IDA-SR, which stands for ID-Agnostic User
Behavior Pre-training approach for Sequential Recommendation. Instead of
explicitly learning representations for item IDs, IDA-SR directly learns item
representations from rich text information. To bridge the gap between text
semantics and sequential user behaviors, we utilize the pre-trained language
model as text encoder, and conduct a pre-training architecture on the
sequential user behaviors. In this way, item text can be directly utilized for
sequential recommendation without relying on item IDs. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed approach can achieve comparable results when only using
ID-agnostic item representations, and performs better than baselines by a large
margin when fine-tuned with ID information.

We present InternLM45;XComposer45;2.5 (IXC45;2.5) a versatile large45;vision language model that supports long45;contextual input and output. IXC45;2.5 excels in various text45;image comprehension and composition applications achieving GPT45;4V level capabilities with merely 7B LLM backend. Trained with 24K interleaved image45;text contexts it can seamlessly extend to 96K long contexts via RoPE extrapolation. This long45;context capability allows IXC45;2.5 to excel in tasks requiring extensive input and output contexts. Compared to its previous 2.0 version InternLM45;XComposer45;2.5 features three major upgrades in vision45;language comprehension (1) Ultra45;High Resolution Understanding (2) Fine45;Grained Video Understanding and (3) Multi45;Turn Multi45;Image Dialogue. In addition to comprehension IXC45;2.5 extends to two compelling applications using extra LoRA parameters for text45;image composition (1) Crafting Webpages and (2) Composing High45;Quality Text45;Image Articles. IXC45;2.5 has been evaluated on 28 benchmarks outperforming existing open45;source state45;of45;the45;art models on 16 benchmarks. It also surpasses or competes closely with GPT45;4V and Gemini Pro on 16 key tasks. The InternLM45;XComposer45;2.5 is publicly available at https://github.com/InternLM/InternLM&#45;XComposer.

We introduce X-VILA an omni-modality model designed to extend the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating image video and audio modalities. By aligning modality-specific encoders with LLM inputs and diffusion decoders with LLM outputs X-VILA achieves cross-modality understanding reasoning and generation. To facilitate this cross-modality alignment we curate an effective interleaved any-to-any modality instruction-following dataset. Furthermore we identify a significant problem with the current cross-modality alignment method which results in visual information loss. To address the issue we propose a visual alignment mechanism with a visual embedding highway module. We then introduce a resource-efficient recipe for training X-VILA that exhibits proficiency in any-to-any modality conversation surpassing previous approaches by large margins. X-VILA also showcases emergent properties across modalities even in the absence of similar training data. The project will be made open-source.

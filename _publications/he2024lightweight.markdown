Evaluation is pivotal for refining Large Language Models (LLMs), pinpointing
their capabilities, and guiding enhancements. The rapid development of LLMs
calls for a lightweight and easy-to-use framework for swift evaluation
deployment. However, considering various implementation details, developing a
comprehensive evaluation platform is never easy. Existing platforms are often
complex and poorly modularized, hindering seamless incorporation into research
workflows. This paper introduces UltraEval, a user-friendly evaluation
framework characterized by its lightweight nature, comprehensiveness,
modularity, and efficiency. We identify and reimplement three core components
of model evaluation (models, data, and metrics). The resulting composability
allows for the free combination of different models, tasks, prompts,
benchmarks, and metrics within a unified evaluation workflow. Additionally,
UltraEval supports diverse models owing to a unified HTTP service and provides
sufficient inference acceleration. UltraEval is now available for researchers
publicly.

In this paper, we explore the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance automated design and
software development in the automotive industry. We present two case studies: a
standardization compliance chatbot and a design copilot, both utilizing RAG to
provide accurate, context-aware responses. We evaluate four LLMs-GPT-4o,
LLAMA3, Mistral, and Mixtral -- comparing their answering accuracy and
execution time. Our results demonstrate that while GPT-4 offers superior
performance, LLAMA3 and Mistral also show promising capabilities for local
deployment, addressing data privacy concerns in automotive applications. This
study highlights the potential of RAG-augmented LLMs in improving design
workflows and compliance in automotive engineering.

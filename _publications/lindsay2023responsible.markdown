Providing rich, constructive feedback to students is essential for supporting
and enhancing their learning. Recent advancements in Generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI), particularly with large language models (LLMs), present new
opportunities to deliver scalable, repeatable, and instant feedback,
effectively making abundant a resource that has historically been scarce and
costly. From a technical perspective, this approach is now feasible due to
breakthroughs in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP). While the potential
educational benefits are compelling, implementing these technologies also
introduces a host of ethical considerations that must be thoughtfully
addressed. One of the core advantages of AI systems is their ability to
automate routine and mundane tasks, potentially freeing up human educators for
more nuanced work. However, the ease of automation risks a ``tyranny of the
majority'', where the diverse needs of minority or unique learners are
overlooked, as they may be harder to systematize and less straightforward to
accommodate. Ensuring inclusivity and equity in AI-generated feedback,
therefore, becomes a critical aspect of responsible AI implementation in
education. The process of developing machine learning models that produce
valuable, personalized, and authentic feedback also requires significant input
from human domain experts. Decisions around whose expertise is incorporated,
how it is captured, and when it is applied have profound implications for the
relevance and quality of the resulting feedback. Additionally, the maintenance
and continuous refinement of these models are necessary to adapt feedback to
evolving contextual, theoretical, and student-related factors. Without ongoing
adaptation, feedback risks becoming obsolete or mismatched with the current
needs of diverse student populations [...]

As the integration of large language models into daily life is on the rise there is a clear gap in benchmarks for advising on subjective and personal dilemmas. To address this we introduce AdvisorQA the first benchmark developed to assess LLMs capability in offering advice for deeply personalized concerns utilizing the LifeProTips subreddit forum. This forum features a dynamic interaction where users post advice-seeking questions receiving an average of 8.9 advice per query with 164.2 upvotes from hundreds of users embodying a collective intelligence framework. Therefore weve completed a benchmark encompassing daily life questions diverse corresponding responses and majority vote ranking to train our helpfulness metric. Baseline experiments validate the efficacy of AdvisorQA through our helpfulness metric GPT-4 and human evaluation analyzing phenomena beyond the trade-off between helpfulness and harmlessness. AdvisorQA marks a significant leap in enhancing QA systems for providing personalized empathetic advice showcasing LLMs improved understanding of human subjectivity.

Large language models (LLMs) are shaping a new user interface (UI) paradigm in writing tools by enabling users to generate text through prompts. This paradigm shifts some creative control from the user to the system thereby diminishing the users authorship and autonomy in the writing process. To restore autonomy we introduce Textfocals a UI prototype designed to investigate a human-centered approach that emphasizes the users role in writing. Textfocals supports the writing process by providing LLM-generated summaries questions and advice (i.e. LLM views) in a sidebar of a text editor encouraging reflection and self-driven revision in writing without direct text generation. Textfocals UI affordances including contextually adaptive views and scaffolding for prompt selection and customization offer a novel way to interact with LLMs where users maintain full authorship of their writing. A formative user study with Textfocals showed promising evidence that this approach might help users develop underdeveloped ideas cater to the rhetorical audience and clarify their writing. However the study also showed interaction design challenges related to document navigation and scoping prompt engineering and context management. Our work highlights the breadth of the design space of writing support interfaces powered by generative AI that maintain authorship integrity.

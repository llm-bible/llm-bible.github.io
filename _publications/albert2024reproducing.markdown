In this study, we propose LLM agents as a novel approach in behavioral
strategy research, complementing simulations and laboratory experiments to
advance our understanding of cognitive processes in decision-making.
Specifically, we reproduce a human laboratory experiment in behavioral strategy
using large language model (LLM) generated agents and investigate how LLM
agents compare to observed human behavior. Our results show that LLM agents
effectively reproduce search behavior and decision-making comparable to humans.
Extending our experiment, we analyze LLM agents' simulated "thoughts,"
discovering that more forward-looking thoughts correlate with favoring
exploitation over exploration to maximize wealth. We show how this new approach
can be leveraged in behavioral strategy research and address limitations.

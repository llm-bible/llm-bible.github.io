In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) rapidly gained popularity
across all parts of society, including education. After initial skepticism and
bans, many schools have chosen to embrace this new technology by integrating it
into their curricula in the form of virtual tutors and teaching assistants.
However, neither the companies developing this technology nor the public
institutions involved in its implementation have set up a formal system to
collect feedback from the stakeholders impacted by them. In this paper, we
argue that understanding the perceptions of those directly affected by LLMS in
the classroom, such as students and teachers, as well as those indirectly
impacted, like parents and school staff, is essential for ensuring responsible
use of AI in this critical domain. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we
present results of a literature review focusing on the perceptions of LLM-based
chatbots in education. We highlight important gaps in the literature, such as
the exclusion of key educational agents (e.g., parents or school
administrators) when analyzing the role of stakeholders, and the frequent
omission of the learning contexts in which the AI systems are implemented.
Thus, we present a taxonomy that organizes existing literature on stakeholder
perceptions. Second, we propose the Contextualized Perceptions for the Adoption
of Chatbots in Education (Co-PACE) framework, which can be used to
systematically elicit perceptions and inform whether and how LLM-based chatbots
should be designed, developed, and deployed in the classroom.

Knowledge graph question answering is an important technology in intelligent human45;robot interaction which aims at automatically giving answer to human natural language question with the given knowledge graph. For the multi45;relation question with higher variety and complexity the tokens of the question have different priority for the triples selection in the reasoning steps. Most existing models take the question as a whole and ignore the priority information in it. To solve this problem we propose question45;aware memory network for multi45;hop question answering named QA2MN to update the attention on question timely in the reasoning process. In addition we incorporate graph context information into knowledge graph embedding model to increase the ability to represent entities and relations. We use it to initialize the QA2MN model and fine45;tune it in the training process. We evaluate QA2MN on PathQuestion and WorldCup2014 two representative datasets for complex multi45;hop question answering. The result demonstrates that QA2MN achieves state45;of45;the45;art Hits35;64;1 accuracy on the two datasets which validates the effectiveness of our model.

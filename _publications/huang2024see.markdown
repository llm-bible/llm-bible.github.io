Knowledge45;editing updates knowledge of large language models (LLMs) and contributes to the interpretability and application of LLMs. However knowledge applying is context45;consistent LLMs can recall the same knowledge in different contexts. Existing works ignore this property and the editing lacks generalization. In this paper we empirically find that the effects of different contexts upon LLMs in recalling the same knowledge follow a Gaussian45;like distribution. We then sample Gaussian noises to simulate the effects of different contexts when updating LLMs. By such we can make LLMs see the unseen contexts where the edited knowledge will be applied therefore improving the editing generalization. Experimental results on three LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and also distinguish our methods from the others of fine45;tuning LLMs by noises.

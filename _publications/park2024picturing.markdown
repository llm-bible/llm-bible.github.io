Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in tasks like the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC) showcasing advanced textual common45;sense reasoning. However applying this reasoning to multimodal domains where understanding text and images together is essential remains a substantial challenge. To address this we introduce WinoVis a novel dataset specifically designed to probe text45;to45;image models on pronoun disambiguation within multimodal contexts. Utilizing GPT45;4 for prompt generation and Diffusion Attentive Attribution Maps (DAAM) for heatmap analysis we propose a novel evaluation framework that isolates the models ability in pronoun disambiguation from other visual processing challenges. Evaluation of successive model versions reveals that despite incremental advancements Stable Diffusion 2.0 achieves a precision of 56.737; on WinoVis only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further error analysis identifies important areas for future research aimed at advancing text45;to45;image models in their ability to interpret and interact with the complex visual world.

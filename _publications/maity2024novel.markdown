We introduce a multi45;stage prompting approach (MSP) for the generation of multiple choice questions (MCQs) harnessing the capabilities of GPT models such as text45;davinci45;003 and GPT45;4 renowned for their excellence across various NLP tasks. Our approach incorporates the innovative concept of chain45;of45;thought prompting a progressive technique in which the GPT model is provided with a series of interconnected cues to guide the MCQ generation process. Automated evaluations consistently demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MSP method over the traditional single45;stage prompting (SSP) baseline resulting in the production of high45;quality distractors. Furthermore the one45;shot MSP technique enhances automatic evaluation results contributing to improved distractor generation in multiple languages including English German Bengali and Hindi. In human evaluations questions generated using our approach exhibit superior levels of grammaticality answerability and difficulty highlighting its efficacy in various languages.

Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have centered around a handful of data45;rich languages. What does it take to broaden access to breakthroughs beyond first45;class citizen languages Our work introduces Aya a massively multilingual generative language model that follows instructions in 101 languages of which over 5037; are considered as lower45;resourced. Aya outperforms mT0 and BLOOMZ on the majority of tasks while covering double the number of languages. We introduce extensive new evaluation suites that broaden the state45;of45;art for multilingual eval across 99 languages 45;45; including discriminative and generative tasks human evaluation and simulated win rates that cover both held45;out tasks and in45;distribution performance. Furthermore we conduct detailed investigations on the optimal finetuning mixture composition data pruning as well as the toxicity bias and safety of our models. We open45;source our instruction datasets and our model at https://hf.co/CohereForAI/aya&#45;101

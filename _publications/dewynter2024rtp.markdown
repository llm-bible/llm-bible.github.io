Large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs) are being adopted at remarkable speed although their safety still remains a serious concern. With the advent of multilingual S/LLMs the question now becomes a matter of scale can we expand multilingual safety evaluations of these models with the same velocity at which they are deployed To this end we introduce RTP45;LX a human45;transcreated and human45;annotated corpus of toxic prompts and outputs in 28 languages. RTP45;LX follows participatory design practices and a portion of the corpus is especially designed to detect culturally45;specific toxic language. We evaluate seven S/LLMs on their ability to detect toxic content in a culturally45;sensitive multilingual scenario. We find that although they typically score acceptably in terms of accuracy they have low agreement with human judges when judging holistically the toxicity of a prompt and have difficulty discerning harm in context45;dependent scenarios particularly with subtle45;yet45;harmful content (e.g. microagressions bias). We release of this dataset to contribute to further reduce harmful uses of these models and improve their safe deployment.

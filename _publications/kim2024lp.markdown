Creating high-quality, large-scale datasets for large language models (LLMs)
often relies on resource-intensive, GPU-accelerated models for quality
filtering, making the process time-consuming and costly. This dependence on
GPUs limits accessibility for organizations lacking significant computational
infrastructure. To address this issue, we introduce the Lightweight,
Purpose-driven (LP) Data Pipeline, a framework that operates entirely on CPUs
to streamline the processes of dataset extraction, filtering, and curation.
Based on our four core principles, the LP Data Pipeline significantly reduces
preparation time and cost while maintaining high data quality. Importantly, our
pipeline enables the creation of purpose-driven datasets tailored to specific
domains and languages, enhancing the applicability of LLMs in specialized
contexts. We anticipate that our pipeline will lower the barriers to LLM
development, enabling a wide range of organizations to access LLMs more easily.

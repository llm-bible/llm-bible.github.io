The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the healthcare domain
has the potential to significantly enhance patient care and support through the
development of empathetic, patient-facing chatbots. This study investigates an
intriguing question Can ChatGPT respond with a greater degree of empathy than
those typically offered by physicians? To answer this question, we collect a
de-identified dataset of patient messages and physician responses from Mayo
Clinic and generate alternative replies using ChatGPT. Our analyses incorporate
novel empathy ranking evaluation (EMRank) involving both automated metrics and
human assessments to gauge the empathy level of responses. Our findings
indicate that LLM-powered chatbots have the potential to surpass human
physicians in delivering empathetic communication, suggesting a promising
avenue for enhancing patient care and reducing professional burnout. The study
not only highlights the importance of empathy in patient interactions but also
proposes a set of effective automatic empathy ranking metrics, paving the way
for the broader adoption of LLMs in healthcare.

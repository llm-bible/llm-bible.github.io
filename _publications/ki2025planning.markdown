Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents have unlocked new possibilities for
automating human tasks. While prior work has focused on well-defined tasks with
specified goals, the capabilities of agents in creative design tasks with
open-ended goals remain underexplored. We introduce GraphicBench, a new
planning benchmark for graphic design that covers 1,079 user queries and input
images across four design types. We further present GraphicTown, an LLM agent
framework with three design experts and 46 actions (tools) to choose from for
executing each step of the planned workflows in web environments. Experiments
with six LLMs demonstrate their ability to generate workflows that integrate
both explicit design constraints from user queries and implicit commonsense
constraints. However, these workflows often do not lead to successful execution
outcomes, primarily due to challenges in: (1) reasoning about spatial
relationships, (2) coordinating global dependencies across experts, and (3)
retrieving the most appropriate action per step. We envision GraphicBench as a
challenging yet valuable testbed for advancing LLM-agent planning and execution
in creative design tasks.

With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, large
language models (LLMs) have become a hot research topic. Education plays an
important role in human social development and progress. Traditional education
faces challenges such as individual student differences, insufficient
allocation of teaching resources, and assessment of teaching effectiveness.
Therefore, the applications of LLMs in the field of digital/smart education
have broad prospects. The research on educational large models (EduLLMs) is
constantly evolving, providing new methods and approaches to achieve
personalized learning, intelligent tutoring, and educational assessment goals,
thereby improving the quality of education and the learning experience. This
article aims to investigate and summarize the application of LLMs in smart
education. It first introduces the research background and motivation of LLMs
and explains the essence of LLMs. It then discusses the relationship between
digital education and EduLLMs and summarizes the current research status of
educational large models. The main contributions are the systematic summary and
vision of the research background, motivation, and application of large models
for education (LLM4Edu). By reviewing existing research, this article provides
guidance and insights for educators, researchers, and policy-makers to gain a
deep understanding of the potential and challenges of LLM4Edu. It further
provides guidance for further advancing the development and application of
LLM4Edu, while still facing technical, ethical, and practical challenges
requiring further research and exploration.

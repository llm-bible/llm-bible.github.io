We present a human-in-the-loop dashboard tailored to diagnosing potential spurious features that NLI models rely on for predictions. The dashboard enables users to generate diverse and challenging examples by drawing inspiration from GPT-3 suggestions. Additionally users can receive feedback from a trained NLI model on how challenging the newly created example is and make refinements based on the feedback. Through our investigation we discover several categories of spurious correlations that impact the reasoning of NLI models which we group into three categories Semantic Relevance Logical Fallacies and Bias. Based on our findings we identify and describe various research opportunities including diversifying training data and assessing NLI models robustness by creating adversarial test suites.

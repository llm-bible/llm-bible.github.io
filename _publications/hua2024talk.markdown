Humans spontaneously use increasingly efficient language as interactions progress by adapting and forming ad45;hoc conventions. This phenomenon has been studied extensively using reference games showing properties of human language that go beyond relaying intents. It remains unexplored whether multimodal large language models (MLLMs) similarly increase communication efficiency during interactions and what mechanisms they may adopt for this purpose. We introduce ICCA an automated framework to evaluate such conversational adaptation as an in45;context behavior in MLLMs. We evaluate several state45;of45;the45;art MLLMs and observe that while they may understand the increasingly efficient language of their interlocutor they do not spontaneously make their own language more efficient over time. This latter ability can only be elicited in some models (e.g. GPT45;4) with heavy45;handed prompting. This shows that this property of linguistic interaction does not arise from current training regimes even though it is a common hallmark of human language. ICCA is available at https://github.com/lil&#45;lab/ICCA.

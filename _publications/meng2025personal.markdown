Traditional rule-based conversational robots, constrained by predefined
scripts and static response mappings, fundamentally lack adaptability for
personalized, long-term human interaction. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
like GPT-4 have revolutionized conversational AI through open-domain
capabilities, current social robots implementing LLMs still lack emotional
awareness and continuous personalization. This dual limitation hinders their
ability to sustain engagement across multiple interaction sessions. We bridge
this gap with PERCY (Personal Emotional Robotic Conversational sYstem), a
system designed to enable open-domain, multi-turn dialogues by dynamically
analyzing users' real-time facial expressions and vocabulary to tailor
responses based on their emotional state. Built on a ROS-based multimodal
framework, PERCY integrates a fine-tuned GPT-4 reasoning engine, combining
textual sentiment analysis with visual emotional cues to accurately assess and
respond to user emotions. We evaluated PERCY's performance through various
dialogue quality metrics, showing strong coherence, relevance, and diversity.
Human evaluations revealed PERCY's superior personalization and comparable
naturalness to other models. This work highlights the potential for integrating
advanced multimodal perception and personalization in social robot dialogue
systems.

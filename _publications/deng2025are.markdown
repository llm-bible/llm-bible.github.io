As Large Language Models (LLMs) advance in their capabilities, researchers
have increasingly employed them for social simulation. In this paper, we
investigate whether interactions among LLM agents resemble those of humans.
Specifically, we focus on the pronoun usage difference between leaders and
non-leaders, examining whether the simulation would lead to human-like pronoun
usage patterns during the LLMs' interactions. Our evaluation reveals the
significant discrepancies between LLM-based simulations and human pronoun
usage, with prompt-based or specialized agents failing to demonstrate
human-like pronoun usage patterns. In addition, we reveal that even if LLMs
understand the human pronoun usage patterns, they fail to demonstrate them in
the actual interaction process. Our study highlights the limitations of social
simulations based on LLM agents, urging caution in using such social simulation
in practitioners' decision-making process.

Multi45;modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine45;generated instruction45;following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi45;modal understanding and generation tasks. However the hallucinations inherent in machine45;generated data which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs remain under45;explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e. object relation attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large45;scale machine45;generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework HalluciDoctor based on the cross45;checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long45;tail object co45;occurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution thereby enhancing MLLMs resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.637; hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA. The data and code for this paper are publicly available. url123;https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor&#125;.

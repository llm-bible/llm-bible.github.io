This project, titled "Machine Translation with Large Language Models:
Decoder-only vs. Encoder-Decoder," aims to develop a multilingual machine
translation (MT) model. Focused on Indian regional languages, especially
Telugu, Tamil, and Malayalam, the model seeks to enable accurate and
contextually appropriate translations across diverse language pairs. By
comparing Decoder-only and Encoder-Decoder architectures, the project aims to
optimize translation quality and efficiency, advancing cross-linguistic
communication tools.The primary objective is to develop a model capable of
delivering high-quality translations that are accurate and contextually
appropriate. By leveraging large language models, specifically comparing the
effectiveness of Decoder-only and Encoder-Decoder architectures, the project
seeks to optimize translation performance and efficiency across multilingual
contexts. Through rigorous experimentation and analysis, this project aims to
advance the field of machine translation, contributing valuable insights into
the effectiveness of different model architectures and paving the way for
enhanced cross-linguistic communication tools.

Business processes are commonly represented by modelling languages such as Event-driven Process Chain (EPC) Yet Another Workflow Language (YAWL) and the most popular standard notation for modelling business processes the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). Most recently chatbots programs that allow users to interact with a machine using natural language have been increasingly used for business process execution support. A recent category of chatbots worth mentioning is generative-based chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAIs Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) model and Googles Pathways Language Model (PaLM) which are trained on billions of parameters and support conversational intelligence. However it is not clear whether generative-based chatbots are able to understand and meet the requirements of constructs such as those provided by BPMN for process execution support. This paper presents a case study to compare the performance of prominent generative models GPT and PaLM in the context of process execution support. The research sheds light into the challenging problem of using conversational approaches supported by generative chatbots as a means to understand process-aware modelling notations and support users to execute their tasks.

The integration of natural language processing (NLP) technologies into educational applications has shown promising results particularly in the language learning domain. Recently many spoken open45;domain chatbots have been used as speaking partners helping language learners improve their language skills. However one of the significant challenges is the high word45;error45;rate (WER) when recognizing non45;native/non45;fluent speech which interrupts conversation flow and leads to disappointment for learners. This paper explores the use of GPT4 for ASR error correction in conversational settings. In addition to WER we propose to use semantic textual similarity (STS) and next response sensibility (NRS) metrics to evaluate the impact of error correction models on the quality of the conversation. We find that transcriptions corrected by GPT4 lead to higher conversation quality despite an increase in WER. GPT4 also outperforms standard error correction methods without the need for in45;domain training data.

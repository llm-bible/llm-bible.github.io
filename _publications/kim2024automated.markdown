Using LLMs (Large Language Models) in conjunction with external documents has
made RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) an essential technology. Numerous
techniques and modules for RAG are being researched, but their performance can
vary across different datasets. Finding RAG modules that perform well on
specific datasets is challenging. In this paper, we propose the AutoRAG
framework, which automatically identifies suitable RAG modules for a given
dataset. AutoRAG explores and approximates the optimal combination of RAG
modules for the dataset. Additionally, we share the results of optimizing a
dataset using AutoRAG. All experimental results and data are publicly available
and can be accessed through our GitHub repository

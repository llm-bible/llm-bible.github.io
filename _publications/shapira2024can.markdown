Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing finance public policy and more. This task however is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However a key question remains can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction We explore this in language-based persuasion games a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLM-generated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.

The increasing demand for mental health services has led to the rise of
AI-driven mental health chatbots, though challenges related to privacy, data
collection, and expertise persist. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is gaining
attention as a theoretical basis for boosting expertise in the development of
these chatbots. However, existing datasets are showing limitations for training
chatbots, leading to a substantial demand for publicly available resources in
the field of MI and psychotherapy. These challenges are even more pronounced in
non-English languages, where they receive less attention. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework that simulates MI sessions enriched with the
expertise of professional therapists. We train an MI forecaster model that
mimics the behavioral choices of professional therapists and employ Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate utterances through prompt engineering. Then,
we present KMI, the first synthetic dataset theoretically grounded in MI,
containing 1,000 high-quality Korean Motivational Interviewing dialogues.
Through an extensive expert evaluation of the generated dataset and the
dialogue model trained on it, we demonstrate the quality, expertise, and
practicality of KMI. We also introduce novel metrics derived from MI theory in
order to evaluate dialogues from the perspective of MI.

High45;throughput reaction condition (RC) screening is fundamental to chemical synthesis. However current RC screening suffers from laborious and costly trial45;and45;error workflows. Traditional computer45;aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools fail to find suitable RCs due to data sparsity and inadequate reaction representations. Nowadays large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry45;related problems such as molecule design and chemical logic Qamp;A tasks. However LLMs have not yet achieved accurate predictions of chemical reaction conditions. Here we present MM45;RCR a text45;augmented multimodal LLM that learns a unified reaction representation from SMILES reaction graphs and textual corpus for chemical reaction recommendation (RCR). To train MM45;RCR we construct 1.2 million pair45;wised Qamp;A instruction datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that MM45;RCR achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance on two open benchmark datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out45;of45;domain (OOD) and High45;Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets. MM45;RCR has the potential to accelerate high45;throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.

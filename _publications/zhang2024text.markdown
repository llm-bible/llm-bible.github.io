High-throughput reaction condition (RC) screening is fundamental to chemical synthesis. However current RC screening suffers from laborious and costly trial-and-error workflows. Traditional computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools fail to find suitable RCs due to data sparsity and inadequate reaction representations. Nowadays large language models (LLMs) are capable of tackling chemistry-related problems such as molecule design and chemical logic Qamp;A tasks. However LLMs have not yet achieved accurate predictions of chemical reaction conditions. Here we present MM-RCR a text-augmented multimodal LLM that learns a unified reaction representation from SMILES reaction graphs and textual corpus for chemical reaction recommendation (RCR). To train MM-RCR we construct 1.2 million pair-wised Qamp;A instruction datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that MM-RCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on two open benchmark datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-domain (OOD) and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets. MM-RCR has the potential to accelerate high-throughput condition screening in chemical synthesis.

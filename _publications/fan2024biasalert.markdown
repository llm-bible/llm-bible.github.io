Evaluating the bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes increasingly crucial with their rapid development. However existing evaluation methods rely on fixed-form outputs and cannot adapt to the flexible open-text generation scenarios of LLMs (e.g. sentence completion and question answering). To address this we introduce BiasAlert a plug-and-play tool designed to detect social bias in open-text generations of LLMs. BiasAlert integrates external human knowledge with inherent reasoning capabilities to detect bias reliably. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiasAlert significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like GPT4-as-A-Judge in detecting bias. Furthermore through application studies we demonstrate the utility of BiasAlert in reliable LLM bias evaluation and bias mitigation across various scenarios. Model and code will be publicly released.

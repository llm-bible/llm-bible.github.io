Despite being heralded as the new standard for dialogue evaluation the closed-source nature of GPT-4 poses challenges for the community. Motivated by the need for lightweight open source and multilingual dialogue evaluators this paper introduces GenResCoh (Generated Responses targeting Coherence). GenResCoh is a novel LLM generated dataset comprising over 130k negative and positive responses and accompanying explanations seeded from XDailyDialog and XPersona covering English French German Italian and Chinese. Leveraging GenResCoh we propose ECoh (Evaluation of Coherence) a family of evaluators trained to assess response coherence across multiple languages. Experimental results demonstrate that ECoh achieves multilingual detection capabilities superior to the teacher model (GPT-3.5-Turbo) on GenResCoh despite being based on a much smaller architecture. Furthermore the explanations provided by ECoh closely align in terms of quality with those generated by the teacher model.

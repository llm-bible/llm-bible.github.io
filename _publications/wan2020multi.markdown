Multiple-choice Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) is an important and challenging Natural Language Understanding (NLU) task in which a machine must choose the answer to a question from a set of choices with the question placed in context of text passages or dialog. In the last a couple of years the NLU field has been revolutionized with the advent of models based on the Transformer architecture which are pretrained on massive amounts of unsupervised data and then fine-tuned for various supervised learning NLU tasks. Transformer models have come to dominate a wide variety of leader-boards in the NLU field; in the area of MRC the current state-of-the-art model on the DREAM dataset (seeSunet al. 2019) fine tunes Albert a large pretrained Transformer-based model and addition-ally combines it with an extra layer of multi-head attention between context and question-answerZhuet al. 2020.The purpose of this note is to document a new state-of-the-art result in the DREAM task which is accomplished by additionally performing multi-task learning on two MRC multi-choice reading comprehension tasks (RACE and DREAM).

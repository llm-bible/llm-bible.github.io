Generative AI models such as the GPT and Llama series have significant potential to assist laypeople in answering legal questions. However little prior work focuses on the data sourcing inference and evaluation of these models in the context of laypersons. To this end we propose a human-centric legal NLP pipeline covering data sourcing inference and evaluation. We introduce and release a dataset LegalQA with real and specific legal questions spanning from employment law to criminal law corresponding answers written by legal experts and citations for each answer. We develop an automatic evaluation protocol for this dataset then show that retrieval-augmented generation from only 850 citations in the train set can match or outperform internet-wide retrieval despite containing 9 orders of magnitude less data. Finally we propose future directions for open-sourced efforts which fall behind closed-sourced models.

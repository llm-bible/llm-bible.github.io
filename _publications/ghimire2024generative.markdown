The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. This study delves into university instructors experiences and attitudes toward AI language models filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators perspectives on AIs role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness overall sentiment towardsadoption and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI45;based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale which was complemented by follow45;up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI45;generated work.

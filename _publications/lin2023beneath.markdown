The age of social media is rife with memes. Understanding and detecting harmful memes pose a significant challenge due to their implicit meaning that is not explicitly conveyed through the surface text and image. However existing harmful meme detection approaches only recognize superficial harm45;indicative signals in an end45;to45;end classification manner but ignore in45;depth cognition of the meme text and image. In this paper we attempt to detect harmful memes based on advanced reasoning over the interplay of multimodal information in memes. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning we first conduct abductive reasoning with LLMs. Then we propose a novel generative framework to learn reasonable thoughts from LLMs for better multimodal fusion and lightweight fine45;tuning which consists of two training stages 1) Distill multimodal reasoning knowledge from LLMs; and 2) Fine45;tune the generative framework to infer harmfulness. Extensive experiments conducted on three meme datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves superior performance than state45;of45;the45;art methods on the harmful meme detection task.

The automatic generation of counter-speech (CS) is a critical strategy for
addressing hate speech by providing constructive and informed responses.
However, existing methods often fail to generate high-quality, impactful, and
scalable CS, particularly across diverse linguistic contexts. In this paper, we
propose a novel methodology to enhance CS generation by aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages DPO to align LLM outputs with human
preferences, ensuring contextually appropriate and linguistically adaptable
responses. Additionally, we incorporate knowledge grounding to enhance the
factual accuracy and relevance of generated CS. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPO-aligned models significantly outperform SFT baselines on
CS benchmarks while scaling effectively to multiple languages. These findings
highlight the potential of preference-based alignment techniques to advance CS
generation across varied linguistic settings. The model supervision and
alignment is done in English and the same model is used for reporting metrics
across other languages like Basque, Italian, and Spanish.

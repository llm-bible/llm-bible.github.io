Large Language Model (LLM) tools have demonstrated their potential to deliver
high-quality assistance by providing instant, personalized feedback that is
crucial for effective programming education. However, many of these tools
operate independently from institutional Learning Management Systems, which
creates a significant disconnect. This isolation limits the ability to leverage
learning materials and exercise context for generating tailored, context-aware
feedback. Furthermore, previous research on self-regulated learning and LLM
support mainly focused on knowledge acquisition, not the development of
important self-regulation skills. To address these challenges, we developed
CodeRunner Agent, an LLM-based programming assistant that integrates the
CodeRunner, a student-submitted code executing and automated grading plugin in
Moodle. CodeRunner Agent empowers educators to customize AI-generated feedback
by incorporating detailed context from lecture materials, programming
questions, student answers, and execution results. Additionally, it enhances
students' self-regulated learning by providing strategy-based AI responses.
This integrated, context-aware, and skill-focused approach offers promising
avenues for data-driven improvements in programming education.

Open45;ended questions are a favored tool among instructors for assessing student understanding and encouraging critical exploration of course material. Providing feedback for such responses is a time45;consuming task that can lead to overwhelmed instructors and decreased feedback quality. Many instructors resort to simpler question formats like multiple45;choice questions which provide immediate feedback but at the expense of personalized and insightful comments. Here we present a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) guided by instructor45;defined criteria to automate responses to open45;ended questions. Our tool delivers rapid personalized feedback enabling students to quickly test their knowledge and identify areas for improvement. We provide open45;source reference implementations both as a web application and as a Jupyter Notebook widget that can be used with instructional coding or math notebooks. With instructor guidance LLMs hold promise to enhance student learning outcomes and elevate instructional methodologies.

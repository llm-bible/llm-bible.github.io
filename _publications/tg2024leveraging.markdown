This paper presents a new approach to multiple language learning, with Hindi
the language to be learnt in our case, by using the integration of virtual
reality environments and AI enabled tutoring systems using OpenAIs GPT api
calls. We have developed a scenario which has a virtual campus environment
using Unity which focuses on a detailed representation of our universitys
buildings 11th floor, where most of the cultural and technological activities
take place. Within this virtual environment that we have created, we have an AI
tutor powered by OpenAI's GPT model which was called using an api which moves
around with the user. This provided language learning support in Hindi, as GPT
is able to take care of language translation. Our approach mainly involves
utilising speech to text, text to text conversion and text to speech
capabilities to facilitate real time interaction between users and the AI tutor
in the presence of internet. This research demonstrates the use of combining VR
technology with AI tutoring for immersive language learning experiences and
provides interaction.

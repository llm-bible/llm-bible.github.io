The advancements in cloud-based Large Languages Models (LLMs) have
revolutionized AI-assisted programming. However, their integration into certain
local development environments like ones within the Apple software ecosystem
(e.g., iOS apps, macOS) remains challenging due to computational demands and
sandboxed constraints. This paper presents CAMP, a multi-model AI-assisted
programming framework that consists of a local model that employs
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve contextual information from
the codebase to facilitate context-aware prompt construction thus optimizing
the performance of the cloud model, empowering LLMs' capabilities in local
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The methodology is actualized in
Copilot for Xcode, an AI-assisted programming tool crafted for Xcode that
employs the RAG module to address software constraints and enables diverse
generative programming tasks, including automatic code completion,
documentation, error detection, and intelligent user-agent interaction. The
results from objective experiments on generated code quality and subjective
experiments on user adoption collectively demonstrate the pilot success of the
proposed system and mark its significant contributions to the realm of
AI-assisted programming.

Expressive robotic behavior is essential for the widespread acceptance of
robots in social environments. Recent advancements in learned legged locomotion
controllers have enabled more dynamic and versatile robot behaviors. However,
determining the optimal behavior for interactions with different users across
varied scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods either rely on natural
language input, which is efficient but low-resolution, or learn from human
preferences, which, although high-resolution, is sample inefficient. This paper
introduces a novel approach that leverages priors generated by pre-trained LLMs
alongside the precision of preference learning. Our method, termed
Language-Guided Preference Learning (LGPL), uses LLMs to generate initial
behavior samples, which are then refined through preference-based feedback to
learn behaviors that closely align with human expectations. Our core insight is
that LLMs can guide the sampling process for preference learning, leading to a
substantial improvement in sample efficiency. We demonstrate that LGPL can
quickly learn accurate and expressive behaviors with as few as four queries,
outperforming both purely language-parameterized models and traditional
preference learning approaches. Website with videos:

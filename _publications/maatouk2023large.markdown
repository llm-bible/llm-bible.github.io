Large Language Models (LLMs), AI-driven models that can achieve
general-purpose language understanding and generation, have emerged as a
transformative force, revolutionizing fields well beyond Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and garnering unprecedented attention. As LLM technology
continues to progress, the telecom industry is facing the prospect of its
impact on its landscape. To elucidate these implications, we delve into the
inner workings of LLMs, providing insights into their current capabilities and
limitations. We also examine the use cases that can be readily implemented in
the telecom industry, streamlining tasks, such as anomalies resolutions and
technical specifications comprehension, which currently hinder operational
efficiency and demand significant manpower and expertise. Furthermore, we
uncover essential research directions that deal with the distinctive challenges
of utilizing the LLMs within the telecom domain. Addressing them represents a
significant stride towards fully harnessing the potential of LLMs and unlocking
their capabilities to the fullest extent within the telecom domain.

Research on text45;to45;image generation (TTI) still predominantly focuses on the English language due to the lack of annotated image45;caption data in other languages; in the long run this might widen inequitable access to TTI technology. In this work we thus investigate multilingual TTI (termed mTTI) and the current potential of neural machine translation (NMT) to bootstrap mTTI systems. We provide two key contributions. 1) Relying on a multilingual multi45;modal encoder we provide a systematic empirical study of standard methods used in cross45;lingual NLP when applied to mTTI Translate Train Translate Test and Zero45;Shot Transfer. 2) We propose Ensemble Adapter (EnsAd) a novel parameter45;efficient approach that learns to weigh and consolidate the multilingual text knowledge within the mTTI framework mitigating the language gap and thus improving mTTI performance. Our evaluations on standard mTTI datasets COCO45;CN Multi30K Task2 and LAION45;5B demonstrate the potential of translation45;enhanced mTTI systems and also validate the benefits of the proposed EnsAd which derives consistent gains across all datasets. Further investigations on model variants ablation studies and qualitative analyses provide additional insights on the inner workings of the proposed mTTI approaches.

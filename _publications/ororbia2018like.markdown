We examine the benefits of visual context in training neural language models to perform next45;word prediction. A multi45;modal neural architecture is introduced that outperform its equivalent trained on language alone with a 237; decrease in perplexity even when no visual context is available at test. Fine45;tuning the embeddings of a pre45;trained state45;of45;the45;art bidirectional language model (BERT) in the language modeling framework yields a 3.537; improvement. The advantage for training with visual context when testing without is robust across different languages (English German and Spanish) and different models (GRU LSTM Delta45;RNN as well as those that use BERT embeddings). Thus language models perform better when they learn like a baby i.e in a multi45;modal environment. This finding is compatible with the theory of situated cognition language is inseparable from its physical context.

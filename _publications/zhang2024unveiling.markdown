This paper proposes a framework combining Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (Neural ODEs) and robust control theory to enhance the
interpretability and control of large language models (LLMs). By utilizing
Neural ODEs to model the dynamic evolution of input-output relationships and
introducing control mechanisms to optimize output quality, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach across multiple question-answer datasets.
Experimental results show that the integration of Neural ODEs and control
theory significantly improves output consistency and model interpretability,
advancing the development of explainable AI technologies.

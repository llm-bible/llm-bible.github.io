The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) especially in the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI has opened new avenues for application across various fields yet its role in business education remains underexplored. This study introduces the first benchmark to assess the performance of seven major LLMs OpenAIs models (GPT-3.5 Turbo GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo) Googles models (PaLM 2 Gemini 1.0 Pro) and Anthropics models (Claude 2 and Claude 2.1) on the GMAT which is a key exam in the admission process for graduate business programs. Our analysis shows that most LLMs outperform human candidates with GPT-4 Turbo not only outperforming the other models but also surpassing the average scores of graduate students at top business schools. Through a case study this research examines GPT-4 Turbos ability to explain answers evaluate responses identify errors tailor instructions and generate alternative scenarios. The latest LLM versions GPT-4 Turbo Claude 2.1 and Gemini 1.0 Pro show marked improvements in reasoning tasks compared to their predecessors underscoring their potential for complex problem-solving. While AIs promise in education assessment and tutoring is clear challenges remain. Our study not only sheds light on LLMs academic potential but also emphasizes the need for careful development and application of AI in education. As AI technology advances it is imperative to establish frameworks and protocols for AI interaction verify the accuracy of AI-generated content ensure worldwide access for diverse learners and create an educational environment where AI supports human expertise. This research sets the stage for further exploration into the responsible use of AI to enrich educational experiences and improve exam preparation and assessment methods.

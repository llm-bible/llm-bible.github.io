Educational scholars have analyzed various image data acquired from teaching
and learning situations, such as photos that shows classroom dynamics,
students' drawings with regard to the learning content, textbook illustrations,
etc. Unquestioningly, most qualitative analysis of and explanation on image
data have been conducted by human researchers, without machine-based
automation. It was partially because most image processing artificial
intelligence models were not accessible to general educational scholars or
explainable due to their complex deep neural network architecture. However, the
recent development of Visual Question Answering (VQA) techniques is
accomplishing usable visual language models, which receive from the user a
question about the given image and returns an answer, both in natural language.
Particularly, GPT-4V released by OpenAI, has wide opened the state-of-the-art
visual langauge model service so that VQA could be used for a variety of
purposes. However, VQA and GPT-4V have not yet been applied to educational
studies much. In this position paper, we suggest that GPT-4V contributes to
realizing VQA for education. By 'realizing' VQA, we denote two meanings: (1)
GPT-4V realizes the utilization of VQA techniques by any educational scholars
without technical/accessibility barrier, and (2) GPT-4V makes educational
scholars realize the usefulness of VQA to educational research. Given these,
this paper aims to introduce VQA for educational studies so that it provides a
milestone for educational research methodology. In this paper, chapter II
reviews the development of VQA techniques, which primes with the release of
GPT-4V. Chapter III reviews the use of image analysis in educational studies.
Chapter IV demonstrates how GPT-4V can be used for each research usage reviewed
in Chapter III, with operating prompts provided. Finally, chapter V discusses
the future implications.

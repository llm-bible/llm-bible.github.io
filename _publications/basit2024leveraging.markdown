Large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing various domains with their remarkable natural language processing (NLP) abilities. However deploying LLMs in resource45;constrained edge computing and embedded systems presents significant challenges. Another challenge lies in delivering medical assistance in remote areas with limited healthcare facilities and infrastructure. To address this we introduce MedAide an on45;premise healthcare chatbot. It leverages tiny45;LLMs integrated with LangChain providing efficient edge45;based preliminary medical diagnostics and support. MedAide employs model optimizations for minimal memory footprint and latency on embedded edge devices without server infrastructure. The training process is optimized using low45;rank adaptation (LoRA). Additionally the model is trained on diverse medical datasets employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to enhance its domain45;specific capabilities. The system is implemented on various consumer GPUs and Nvidia Jetson development board. MedAide achieves 7737; accuracy in medical consultations and scores 56 in USMLE benchmark enabling an energy45;efficient healthcare assistance platform that alleviates privacy concerns due to edge45;based deployment thereby empowering the community.

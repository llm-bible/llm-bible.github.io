Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of displaying a wide range of abilities that are not directly connected with the task for which they are trained predicting the next words of human-written texts. In this article I review recent research investigating the cognitive abilities developed by LLMs and their relation to human cognition. I discuss the nature of the indirect process that leads to the acquisition of these cognitive abilities their relation to other indirect processes and the implications for the acquisition of integrated abilities. Moreover I propose the factors that enable the development of abilities that are related only very indirectly to the proximal objective of the training task. Finally I discuss whether the full set of capabilities that LLMs could possibly develop is predictable.

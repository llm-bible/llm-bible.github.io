This innovative practice WIP paper describes a research study that explores
the integration of ChatGPT into the software testing curriculum and evaluates
its effectiveness compared to human-generated testing artifacts. In a Capstone
Project course, students were tasked with generating preparatory testing
artifacts using ChatGPT prompts, which they had previously created manually.
Their understanding and the effectiveness of the Artificial Intelligence
generated artifacts were assessed through targeted questions. The results,
drawn from this in-class assignment at a North American community college
indicate that while ChatGPT can automate many testing preparation tasks, it
cannot fully replace human expertise. However, students, already familiar with
Information Technology at the postgraduate level, found the integration of
ChatGPT into their workflow to be straightforward. The study suggests that AI
can be gradually introduced into software testing education to keep pace with
technological advancements.

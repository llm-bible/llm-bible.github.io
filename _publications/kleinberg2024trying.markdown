Differentiating between generated and human-written content is important for
navigating the modern world. Large language models (LLMs) are crucial drivers
behind the increased quality of computer-generated content. Reportedly, humans
find it increasingly difficult to identify whether an AI model generated a
piece of text. Our work tests how two important factors contribute to the human
vs AI race: empathy and an incentive to appear human. We address both aspects
in two experiments: human participants and a state-of-the-art LLM wrote
relationship advice (Study 1, n=530) or mere descriptions (Study 2, n=610),
either instructed to be as human as possible or not. New samples of humans
(n=428 and n=408) then judged the texts' source. Our findings show that when
empathy is required, humans excel. Contrary to expectations, instructions to
appear human were only effective for the LLM, so the human advantage
diminished. Computational text analysis revealed that LLMs become more human
because they may have an implicit representation of what makes a text human and
effortlessly apply these heuristics. The model resorts to a conversational,
self-referential, informal tone with a simpler vocabulary to mimic stochastic
empathy. We discuss these findings in light of recent claims on the on-par
performance of LLMs.

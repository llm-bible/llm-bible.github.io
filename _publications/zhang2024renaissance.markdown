Large Language Models (LLMs) have helped programmers increase efficiency
through code generation, comprehension, and repair. However, their application
to large-scale projects remains challenging due to complex interdependencies
and the extensive size of modern codebases. Although Knuth's concept of
Literate Programming (LP) combines code and natural language to convey logic
and intent, its potential for enhancing relationships in large projects has not
been fully explored. In this study, we introduce the idea of Interoperable LP
(ILP), which leverages literate programming principles to enhance the
development of both small-scale documents and large-scale projects with LLMs.
We investigate how LLMs perform under ILP-style instructions for both
document-oriented tasks and entire projects. Recognizing that many researchers
rely on well-structured templates to guide LLMs, we propose a concise prompt
engineering method to write LP documents so LLMs can better be involved in code
generation. We also examine the capacity of various LLMs to generate Scheme and
Python code on the RepoBench benchmark, illustrating the advantages of our
approach. Our findings indicate that ILP with LLMs can enhance LLM-based code
generation in large-scale project development.

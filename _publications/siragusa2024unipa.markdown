This paper illustrates the architecture and training of Unipa45;GPT a chatbot relying on a Large Language Model developed for assisting students in choosing a bachelor/master degree course at the University of Palermo. Unipa45;GPT relies on gpt45;3.545;turbo it was presented in the context of the European Researchers Night (SHARPER night). In our experiments we adopted both the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach and fine45;tuning to develop the system. The whole architecture of Unipa45;GPT is presented both the RAG and the fine45;tuned systems are compared and a brief discussion on their performance is reported. Further comparison with other Large Language Models and the experimental results during the SHARPER night are illustrated.

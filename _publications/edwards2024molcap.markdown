Bridging biomolecular modeling with natural language information,
particularly through large language models (LLMs), has recently emerged as a
promising interdisciplinary research area. LLMs, having been trained on large
corpora of scientific documents, demonstrate significant potential in
understanding and reasoning about biomolecules by providing enriched contextual
and domain knowledge. However, the extent to which LLM-driven insights can
improve performance on complex predictive tasks (e.g., toxicity) remains
unclear. Further, the extent to which relevant knowledge can be extracted from
LLMs also remains unknown. In this study, we present Molecule Caption Arena:
the first comprehensive benchmark of LLM-augmented molecular property
prediction. We evaluate over twenty LLMs, including both general-purpose and
domain-specific molecule captioners, across diverse prediction tasks. To this
goal, we introduce a novel, battle-based rating system. Our findings confirm
the ability of LLM-extracted knowledge to enhance state-of-the-art molecular
representations, with notable model-, prompt-, and dataset-specific variations.

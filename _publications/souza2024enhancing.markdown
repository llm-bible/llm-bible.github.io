Psychological consultation is essential for improving mental health and well-being yet challenges such as the shortage of qualified professionals and scalability issues limit its accessibility. To address these challenges we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 to augment psychological consultation services. Our approach introduces a novel layered prompting system that dynamically adapts to user input enabling comprehensive and relevant information gathering. We also develop empathy-driven and scenario-based prompts to enhance the LLMs emotional intelligence and contextual understanding in therapeutic settings. We validated our approach through experiments using a newly collected dataset of psychological consultation dialogues demonstrating significant improvements in response quality. The results highlight the potential of our prompt engineering techniques to enhance AI-driven psychological consultation offering a scalable and accessible solution to meet the growing demand for mental health support.

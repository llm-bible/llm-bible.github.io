Seeking dietary guidance often requires navigating complex professional
knowledge while accommodating individual health conditions. Knowledge Graphs
(KGs) offer structured and interpretable nutritional information, whereas Large
Language Models (LLMs) naturally facilitate conversational recommendation
delivery. In this paper, we present HealthGenie, an interactive system that
combines the strengths of LLMs and KGs to provide personalized dietary
recommendations along with hierarchical information visualization for a quick
and intuitive overview. Upon receiving a user query, HealthGenie performs query
refinement and retrieves relevant information from a pre-built KG. The system
then visualizes and highlights pertinent information, organized by defined
categories, while offering detailed, explainable recommendation rationales.
Users can further tailor these recommendations by adjusting preferences
interactively. Our evaluation, comprising a within-subject comparative
experiment and an open-ended discussion, demonstrates that HealthGenie
effectively supports users in obtaining personalized dietary guidance based on
their health conditions while reducing interaction effort and cognitive load.
These findings highlight the potential of LLM-KG integration in supporting
decision-making through explainable and visualized information. We examine the
system's usefulness and effectiveness with an N=12 within-subject study and
provide design considerations for future systems that integrate conversational
LLM and KG.

Problematic smartphone use negatively affects physical and mental health. Despite the wide range of prior research existing persuasive techniques are not flexible enough to provide dynamic persuasion content based on users physical contexts and mental states. We first conducted a Wizard45;of45;Oz study (N=12) and an interview study (N=10) to summarize the mental states behind problematic smartphone use boredom stress and inertia. This informs our design of four persuasion strategies understanding comforting evoking and scaffolding habits. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) to enable the automatic and dynamic generation of effective persuasion content. We developed MindShift a novel LLM45;powered problematic smartphone use intervention technique. MindShift takes users in45;the45;moment app usage behaviors physical contexts mental states goals amp; habits as input and generates personalized and dynamic persuasive content with appropriate persuasion strategies. We conducted a 545;week field experiment (N=25) to compare MindShift with its simplified version (remove mental states) and baseline techniques (fixed reminder). The results show that MindShift improves intervention acceptance rates by 4.745;22.537; and reduces smartphone usage duration by 7.445;9.837;. Moreover users have a significant drop in smartphone addiction scale scores and a rise in self45;efficacy scale scores. Our study sheds light on the potential of leveraging LLMs for context45;aware persuasion in other behavior change domains.

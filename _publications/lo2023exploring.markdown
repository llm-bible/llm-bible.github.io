This paper examines the capacity of LLMs to reason with knowledge graphs using their internal knowledge graph, i.e., the knowledge graph they learned during pre-training. Two research questions are formulated to investigate the accuracy of LLMs in recalling information from pre-training knowledge graphs and their ability to infer knowledge graph relations from context. To address these questions, we employ LLMs to perform four distinct knowledge graph reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we identify two types of hallucinations that may occur during knowledge reasoning with LLMs: content and ontology hallucination. Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can successfully tackle both simple and complex knowledge graph reasoning tasks from their own memory, as well as infer from input context.

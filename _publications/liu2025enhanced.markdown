Depressive and anxiety disorders are widespread, necessitating timely
identification and management. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer potential solutions, yet high costs and ethical concerns about training
data remain challenges. This paper introduces a pipeline for synthesizing
clinical interviews, resulting in 1,157 interactive dialogues (PsyInterview),
and presents EmoScan, an LLM-based emotional disorder screening system. EmoScan
distinguishes between coarse (e.g., anxiety or depressive disorders) and fine
disorders (e.g., major depressive disorders) and conducts high-quality
interviews. Evaluations showed that EmoScan exceeded the performance of base
models and other LLMs like GPT-4 in screening emotional disorders
(F1-score=0.7467). It also delivers superior explanations (BERTScore=0.9408)
and demonstrates robust generalizability (F1-score of 0.67 on an external
dataset). Furthermore, EmoScan outperforms baselines in interviewing skills, as
validated by automated ratings and human evaluations. This work highlights the
importance of scalable data-generative pipelines for developing effective
mental health LLM tools.

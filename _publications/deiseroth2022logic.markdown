Text-to-image models have recently achieved remarkable success with seemingly
accurate samples in photo-realistic quality. However as state-of-the-art
language models still struggle evaluating precise statements consistently, so
do language model based image generation processes. In this work we showcase
problems of state-of-the-art text-to-image models like DALL-E with generating
accurate samples from statements related to the draw bench benchmark.
Furthermore we show that CLIP is not able to rerank those generated samples
consistently. To this end we propose LogicRank, a neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that can result in a more accurate ranking-system for such
precision-demanding settings. LogicRank integrates smoothly into the generation
process of text-to-image models and moreover can be used to further fine-tune
towards a more logical precise model.

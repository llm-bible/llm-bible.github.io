Reinforcement learning (RL) enhanced large language models (LLMs),
particularly exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have exhibited outstanding
performance. Despite the effectiveness in improving LLM capabilities, its
implementation remains highly complex, requiring complex algorithms, reward
modeling strategies, and optimization techniques. This complexity poses
challenges for researchers and practitioners in developing a systematic
understanding of RL-enhanced LLMs. Moreover, the absence of a comprehensive
survey summarizing existing research on RL-enhanced LLMs has limited progress
in this domain, hindering further advancements.
  In this work, we are going to make a systematic review of the most up-to-date
state of knowledge on RL-enhanced LLMs, attempting to consolidate and analyze
the rapidly growing research in this field, helping researchers understand the
current challenges and advancements. Specifically, we (1) detail the basics of
RL; (2) introduce popular RL-enhanced LLMs; (3) review researches on two
widely-used reward model-based RL techniques: Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF); and (4)
explore Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a set of methods that bypass the
reward model to directly use human preference data for aligning LLM outputs
with human expectations. We will also point out current challenges and
deficiencies of existing methods and suggest some avenues for further
improvements. Project page of this work can be found at

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are reshaping content creation
and academic writing. This study investigates the impact of AI-assisted
generative revisions on research manuscripts, focusing on heterogeneous
adoption patterns and their influence on writing convergence. Leveraging a
dataset of over 627,000 academic papers from arXiv, we develop a novel
classification framework by fine-tuning prompt- and discipline-specific large
language models to detect the style of ChatGPT-revised texts. Our findings
reveal substantial disparities in LLM adoption across academic disciplines,
gender, native language status, and career stage, alongside a rapid evolution
in scholarly writing styles. Moreover, LLM usage enhances clarity, conciseness,
and adherence to formal writing conventions, with improvements varying by
revision type. Finally, a difference-in-differences analysis shows that while
LLMs drive convergence in academic writing, early adopters, male researchers,
non-native speakers, and junior scholars exhibit the most pronounced stylistic
shifts, aligning their writing more closely with that of established
researchers.

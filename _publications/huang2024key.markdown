Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in complex reasoning tasks yet their performance is often hampered by the scarcity of high45;quality and reasoning45;focused training datasets. Addressing this challenge we propose Key45;Point45;Driven Data Synthesis (KPDDS) a novel data synthesis framework that synthesizes question45;answer pairs by leveraging key points and exemplar practices from authentic data sources. KPDDS ensures the generation of novel questions with rigorous quality control and substantial scalability. As a result we present KPMath an extensive synthetic dataset tailored for mathematical reasoning comprising over 800K question45;answer pairs. Utilizing KPMath and augmenting it with additional reasoning45;intensive corpora we create the comprehensive KPMath45;Plus dataset. The Qwen1.545;72B model fine45;tuned on KPMath45;Plus achieves 87.037; PASS35;64;1 accuracy on GSM8K and 58.337; on MATH surpassing competitors in the 7B to 70B range and best commercial models like GPT45;4 across multiple math reasoning datasets.

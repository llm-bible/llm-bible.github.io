This study introduces Purrfessor, an innovative AI chatbot designed to
provide personalized dietary guidance through interactive, multimodal
engagement. Leveraging the Large Language-and-Vision Assistant (LLaVA) model
fine-tuned with food and nutrition data and a human-in-the-loop approach,
Purrfessor integrates visual meal analysis with contextual advice to enhance
user experience and engagement. We conducted two studies to evaluate the
chatbot's performance and user experience: (a) simulation assessments and human
validation were conducted to examine the performance of the fine-tuned model;
(b) a 2 (Profile: Bot vs. Pet) by 3 (Model: GPT-4 vs. LLaVA vs. Fine-tuned
LLaVA) experiment revealed that Purrfessor significantly enhanced users'
perceptions of care (\\(\beta = 1.59\\), \\(p = 0.04\\)) and interest (\\(\beta = 2.26\\),
\\(p = 0.01\\)) compared to the GPT-4 bot. Additionally, user interviews
highlighted the importance of interaction design details, emphasizing the need
for responsiveness, personalization, and guidance to improve user engagement.

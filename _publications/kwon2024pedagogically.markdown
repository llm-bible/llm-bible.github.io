Large Language Models (LLMs) have a great potential to serve as readily available and cost45;efficient Conversational Intelligent Tutoring Systems (CITS) for teaching L2 learners of English. Existing CITS however are designed to teach only simple concepts or lack the pedagogical depth necessary to address diverse learning strategies. To develop a more pedagogically informed CITS capable of teaching complex concepts we construct a BIlingual PEDagogically45;informed Tutoring Dataset (BIPED) of one45;on45;one human45;to45;human English tutoring interactions. Through post45;hoc analysis of the tutoring interactions we come up with a lexicon of dialogue acts (34 tutor acts and 9 student acts) which we use to further annotate the collected dataset. Based on a two45;step framework of first predicting the appropriate tutor act then generating the corresponding response we implemented two CITS models using GPT45;4 and SOLAR45;KO respectively. We experimentally demonstrate that the implemented models not only replicate the style of human teachers but also employ diverse and contextually appropriate pedagogical strategies.

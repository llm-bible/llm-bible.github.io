Recently there has been growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific research. Numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the ability of LLMs for scientific research. However current benchmarks are mostly based on pre-collected objective questions. This design suffers from data leakage problem and lacks the evaluation of subjective Q/A ability. In this paper we propose SciEval a comprehensive and multi-disciplinary evaluation benchmark to address these issues. Based on Blooms taxonomy SciEval covers four dimensions to systematically evaluate scientific research ability. In particular we design a dynamic subset based on scientific principles to prevent evaluation from potential data leakage. Both objective and subjective questions are included in SciEval. These characteristics make SciEval a more effective benchmark for scientific research ability evaluation of LLMs. Comprehensive experiments on most advanced LLMs show that although GPT-4 achieves SOTA performance compared to other LLMs there is still substantial room for improvement especially for dynamic questions. The data and codes are now publicly available.

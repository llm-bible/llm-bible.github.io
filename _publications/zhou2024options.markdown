Question45;Options Generation (QOG) is a task that involves generating a set of question45;options pairs given context. This task has various applications including fine45;tuning large models information retrieval and automated multiple45;choice question generation for education. In this paper we develop QOG models using three different methods based on fine45;tuning sequence45;to45;sequence language models (LMs). Experiments demonstrate that the end45;to45;end QOG model is computationally efficient and stable during both training and inference outperforming other methods. Furthermore our analysis indicates that our QOG models are competitive on the QOG task compared to the large language model Llama 345;8B.

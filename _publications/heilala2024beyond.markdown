Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) can reshape education and
learning. While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT dominate current
educational research, multimodal capabilities, such as text-to-speech and
text-to-image, are less explored. This study uses topic modeling to map the
research landscape of multimodal and generative AI in education. An extensive
literature search using Dimensions yielded 4175 articles. Employing a topic
modeling approach, latent topics were extracted, resulting in 38 interpretable
topics organized into 14 thematic areas. Findings indicate a predominant focus
on text-to-text models in educational contexts, with other modalities
underexplored, overlooking the broader potential of multimodal approaches. The
results suggest a research gap, stressing the importance of more balanced
attention across different AI modalities and educational levels. In summary,
this research provides an overview of current trends in generative AI for
education, underlining opportunities for future exploration of multimodal
technologies to fully realize the transformative potential of artificial
intelligence in education.

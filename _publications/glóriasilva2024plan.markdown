Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow user instructions has been shown to supply the LLM with ample capacity to converse fluently while being aligned with humans. Yet it is not completely clear how an LLM can lead a plan45;grounded conversation in mixed45;initiative settings where instructions flow in both directions of the conversation i.e. both the LLM and the user provide instructions to one another. In this paper we tackle a dual goal mixed45;initiative conversational setting where the LLM not only grounds the conversation on an arbitrary plan but also seeks to satisfy both a procedural plan and user instructions. The LLM is then responsible for guiding the user through the plan and at the same time adapting to new circumstances answering questions and activating safety guardrails when needed. We propose a novel LLM that grounds the dialogue on a procedural plan can take the dialogue initiative and enforces guardrails on the systems behavior while also improving the LLMs responses to unexpected user behavior. Experiments in controlled settings and with real users show that the best45;performing model which we call PlanLLM achieves a 2.1x improvement over a strong baseline. Moreover experiments also show good generalization to unseen domains.

The astonishing performance of large language models (LLMs) and their
remarkable achievements in production and daily life have led to their
widespread application in collaborative tasks. However, current large models
face challenges such as hallucination and lack of specificity in content
generation in vertical domain tasks. Inspired by the contrast and
classification mechanisms in human cognitive processes, this paper constructs
an adversarial learning-based prompt framework named ChallengeMe, which
includes three cascaded solutions: generation prompts, evaluation prompts, and
feedback optimization. In this process, we designed seven core optimization
dimensions and set the threshold for adversarial learning. The results of mixed
case studies on the text summarization task show that the proposed framework
can generate more accurate and fluent text summaries compared to the current
advanced mainstream LLMs.

Large language models (LLMs) are widely deployed in various downstream tasks e.g. auto-completion aided writing or chat-based text generation. However the considered output candidates of the underlying search algorithm are under-explored and under-explained. We tackle this shortcoming by proposing a tree-in-the-loop approach where a visual representation of the beam search tree is the central component for analyzing explaining and adapting the generated outputs. To support these tasks we present generAItor a visual analytics technique augmenting the central beam search tree with various task-specific widgets providing targeted visualizations and interaction possibilities. Our approach allows interactions on multiple levels and offers an iterative pipeline that encompasses generating exploring and comparing output candidates as well as fine-tuning the model based on adapted data. Our case study shows that our tool generates new insights in gender bias analysis beyond state-of-the-art template-based methods. Additionally we demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a qualitative user study. Finally we quantitatively evaluate the adaptability of the model to few samples as occurring in text-generation use cases.

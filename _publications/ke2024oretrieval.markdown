Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential for medical applications but
often lack specialized clinical knowledge. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
allows customization with domain-specific information, making it suitable for
healthcare. This study evaluates the accuracy, consistency, and safety of RAG
models in determining fitness for surgery and providing preoperative
instructions. We developed LLM-RAG models using 35 local and 23 international
preoperative guidelines and tested them against human-generated responses. A
total of 3,682 responses were evaluated. Clinical documents were processed
using Llamaindex, and 10 LLMs, including GPT3.5, GPT4, and Claude-3, were
assessed. Fourteen clinical scenarios were analyzed, focusing on seven aspects
of preoperative instructions. Established guidelines and expert judgment were
used to determine correct responses, with human-generated answers serving as
comparisons. The LLM-RAG models generated responses within 20 seconds,
significantly faster than clinicians (10 minutes). The GPT4 LLM-RAG model
achieved the highest accuracy (96.4% vs. 86.6%, p=0.016), with no
hallucinations and producing correct instructions comparable to clinicians.
Results were consistent across both local and international guidelines. This
study demonstrates the potential of LLM-RAG models for preoperative healthcare
tasks, highlighting their efficiency, scalability, and reliability.

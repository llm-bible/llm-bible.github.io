Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven immensely beneficial in education by
capturing vast amounts of literature-based information, allowing them to
generate context without relying on external sources. In this paper, we propose
a generative AI-powered GATE question-answering framework (GATE stands for
Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) that leverages LLMs to explain GATE
solutions and support students in their exam preparation. We conducted
extensive benchmarking to select the optimal embedding model and LLM,
evaluating our framework based on criteria such as latency, faithfulness, and
relevance, with additional validation through human evaluation. Our chatbot
integrates state-of-the-art embedding models and LLMs to deliver accurate,
context-aware responses. Through rigorous experimentation, we identified
configurations that balance performance and computational efficiency, ensuring
a reliable chatbot to serve students' needs. Additionally, we discuss the
challenges faced in data processing and modeling and implemented solutions. Our
work explores the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for GATE
Q/A explanation tasks, and our findings demonstrate significant improvements in
retrieval accuracy and response quality. This research offers practical
insights for developing effective AI-driven educational tools while
highlighting areas for future enhancement in usability and scalability.

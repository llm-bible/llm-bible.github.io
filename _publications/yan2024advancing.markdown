Knowledge45;based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) tasks require answering questions about images using extensive background knowledge. Despite significant advancements generative models often struggle with these tasks due to the limited integration of external knowledge. In this paper we introduce EchoSight a novel multimodal Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to answer visual questions requiring fine45;grained encyclopedic knowledge. To strive for high45;performing retrieval EchoSight first searches wiki articles by using visual45;only information subsequently these candidate articles are further reranked according to their relevance to the combined text45;image query. This approach significantly improves the integration of multimodal knowledge leading to enhanced retrieval outcomes and more accurate VQA responses. Our experimental results on the Encyclopedic VQA and InfoSeek datasets demonstrate that EchoSight establishes new state45;of45;the45;art results in knowledge45;based VQA achieving an accuracy of 41.837; on Encyclopedic VQA and 31.337; on InfoSeek.

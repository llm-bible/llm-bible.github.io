Mental health issues significantly impact individuals' daily lives, yet many
do not receive the help they need even with available online resources. This
study aims to provide diverse, accessible, stigma-free, personalized, and
real-time mental health support through cutting-edge AI technologies. It makes
the following contributions: (1) Conducting an extensive survey of recent
mental health support methods to identify prevalent functionalities and unmet
needs. (2) Introducing SouLLMate, an adaptive LLM-driven system that integrates
LLM technologies, Chain, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), prompt
engineering, and domain knowledge. This system offers advanced features such as
Risk Detection and Proactive Guidance Dialogue, and utilizes RAG for
personalized profile uploads and Conversational Information Extraction. (3)
Developing novel evaluation approaches for preliminary assessments and risk
detection via professionally annotated interview data and real-life suicide
tendency data. (4) Proposing the Key Indicator Summarization (KIS), Proactive
Questioning Strategy (PQS), and Stacked Multi-Model Reasoning (SMMR) methods to
enhance model performance and usability through context-sensitive response
adjustments, semantic coherence evaluations, and enhanced accuracy of
long-context reasoning in language models. This study contributes to advancing
mental health support technologies, potentially improving the accessibility and
effectiveness of mental health care globally.

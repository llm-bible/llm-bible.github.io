Effective conversational systems are expected to dynamically generate
contextual follow-up questions to elicit new information while maintaining the
conversation flow. While humans excel at asking diverse and informative
questions by intuitively assessing both obtained and missing information,
existing models often fall short of human performance on this task. To mitigate
this, we propose a method that generates diverse and informative questions
based on targeting unanswered information using a hypothetical LLM-generated
"comprehensive answer". Our method is applied to augment an existing follow-up
questions dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that language models
fine-tuned on the augmented datasets produce follow-up questions of
significantly higher quality and diversity. This promising approach could be
effectively adopted to future work to augment information-seeking dialogues for
reducing ambiguities and improving the accuracy of LLM answers.

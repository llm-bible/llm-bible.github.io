Recent progress on fine45;grained visual recognition and visual question answering has featured Bilinear Pooling which effectively models the 2^123;nd125; order interactions across multi45;modal inputs. Nevertheless there has not been evidence in support of building such interactions concurrently with attention mechanism for image captioning. In this paper we introduce a unified attention block 45;45; X45;Linear attention block that fully employs bilinear pooling to selectively capitalize on visual information or perform multi45;modal reasoning. Technically X45;Linear attention block simultaneously exploits both the spatial and channel45;wise bilinear attention distributions to capture the 2^123;nd125; order interactions between the input single45;modal or multi45;modal features. Higher and even infinity order feature interactions are readily modeled through stacking multiple X45;Linear attention blocks and equipping the block with Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) in a parameter45;free fashion respectively. Furthermore we present X45;Linear Attention Networks (dubbed as X45;LAN) that novelly integrates X45;Linear attention block(s) into image encoder and sentence decoder of image captioning model to leverage higher order intra45; and inter45;modal interactions. The experiments on COCO benchmark demonstrate that our X45;LAN obtains to45;date the best published CIDEr performance of 132.037; on COCO Karpathy test split. When further endowing Transformer with X45;Linear attention blocks CIDEr is boosted up to 132.837;. Source code is available at url123;https://github.com/Panda&#45;Peter/image&#45;captioning&#125;.

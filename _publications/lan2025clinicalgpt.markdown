Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs)has shown
remarkable reasoning capabilities in domains such as mathematics and coding,
yet their application to clinical diagnosis remains underexplored. Here, we
introduce ClinicalGPT-R1, a reasoning enhanced generalist large language model
for disease diagnosis. Trained on a dataset of 20,000 real-world clinical
records, ClinicalGPT-R1 leverages diverse training strategies to enhance
diagnostic reasoning. To benchmark performance, we curated MedBench-Hard, a
challenging dataset spanning seven major medical specialties and representative
diseases. Experimental results demonstrate that ClinicalGPT-R1 outperforms
GPT-4o in Chinese diagnostic tasks and achieves comparable performance to GPT-4
in English settings. This comparative study effectively validates the superior
performance of ClinicalGPT-R1 in disease diagnosis tasks. Resources are

The development of a large language model (LLM) infrastructure is a pivotal undertaking in artificial intelligence. This paper explores the intricate landscape of LLM infrastructure software and data management. By analyzing these core components we emphasize the pivotal considerations and safeguards crucial for successful LLM development. This work presents a concise synthesis of the challenges and strategies inherent in constructing a robust and effective LLM infrastructure offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners alike.

This article presents a comprehensive review of the challenges associated with using massive web45;mined corpora for the pre45;training of large language models (LLMs). This review identifies key challenges in this domain including challenges such as noise (irrelevant or misleading information) duplication of content the presence of low45;quality or incorrect information biases and the inclusion of sensitive or personal information in web45;mined corpora. Addressing these issues is crucial for the development of accurate reliable and ethically responsible language models. Through an examination of current methodologies for data cleaning pre45;processing bias detection and mitigation we highlight the gaps in existing approaches and suggest directions for future research. Our discussion aims to catalyze advancements in developing more sophisticated and ethically responsible LLMs.

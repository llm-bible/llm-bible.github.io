Applications of generative Large Language Models LLMs are rapidly expanding
across various domains, promising significant improvements in workflow
efficiency and information retrieval. However, their implementation in
specialized, high-stakes domains such as hazardous materials transportation is
challenging due to accuracy and reliability concerns. This study evaluates the
performance of three fine-tuned generative models, ChatGPT, Google's Vertex AI,
and ORNL Retrieval Augmented Generation augmented LLaMA 2 and LLaMA in
retrieving regulatory information essential for hazardous material
transportation compliance in the United States. Utilizing approximately 40
publicly available federal and state regulatory documents, we developed 100
realistic queries relevant to route planning and permitting requirements.
Responses were qualitatively rated based on accuracy, detail, and relevance,
complemented by quantitative assessments of semantic similarity between model
outputs. Results demonstrated that the RAG-augmented LLaMA models significantly
outperformed Vertex AI and ChatGPT, providing more detailed and generally
accurate information, despite occasional inconsistencies. This research
introduces the first known application of RAG in transportation safety,
emphasizing the need for domain-specific fine-tuning and rigorous evaluation
methodologies to ensure reliability and minimize the risk of inaccuracies in
high-stakes environments.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Natural
Language Processing tasks, including Machine Translation (MT). In this work, we
propose a novel MT pipeline that integrates emotion information extracted from
a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model into LLMs to enhance translation
quality. We first fine-tune five existing LLMs on the Libri-trans dataset and
select the most performant model. Subsequently, we augment LLM prompts with
different dimensional emotions and train the selected LLM under these different
configurations. Our experiments reveal that integrating emotion information,
especially arousal, into LLM prompts leads to notable improvements in
translation quality.

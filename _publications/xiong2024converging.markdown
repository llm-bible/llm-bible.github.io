This article explores the convergence of connectionist and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) from historical debates to contemporary advancements. Traditionally considered distinct paradigms connectionist AI focuses on neural networks while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT45;4 highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM45;empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text45;based knowledge modeling and representation LAAs integrate neuro45;symbolic AI principles showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision45;making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro45;symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human45;like reasoning processes scaling effectively with large datasets and leveraging in45;context samples without explicit re45;training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro45;vector45;symbolic integration instructional encoding and implicit reasoning aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro45;symbolic AI and proposing future research trajectories this work advances the understanding and development of AI technologies.

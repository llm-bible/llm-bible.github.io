This article explores the convergence of connectionist and symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) from historical debates to contemporary advancements. Traditionally considered distinct paradigms connectionist AI focuses on neural networks while symbolic AI emphasizes symbolic representation and logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) exemplified by ChatGPT and GPT-4 highlight the potential of connectionist architectures in handling human language as a form of symbols. The study argues that LLM-empowered Autonomous Agents (LAAs) embody this paradigm convergence. By utilizing LLMs for text-based knowledge modeling and representation LAAs integrate neuro-symbolic AI principles showcasing enhanced reasoning and decision-making capabilities. Comparing LAAs with Knowledge Graphs within the neuro-symbolic AI theme highlights the unique strengths of LAAs in mimicking human-like reasoning processes scaling effectively with large datasets and leveraging in-context samples without explicit re-training. The research underscores promising avenues in neuro-vector-symbolic integration instructional encoding and implicit reasoning aimed at further enhancing LAA capabilities. By exploring the progression of neuro-symbolic AI and proposing future research trajectories this work advances the understanding and development of AI technologies.

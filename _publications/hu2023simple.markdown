Vision Language Models (VLMs) which extend Large Language Models (LLM) by incorporating visual understanding capability have demonstrated significant advancements in addressing open-ended visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. However these models cannot accurately interpret images infused with text a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. Standard procedures for extracting information from images often involve learning a fixed set of query embeddings. These embeddings are designed to encapsulate image contexts and are later used as soft prompt inputs in LLMs. Yet this process is limited to the token count potentially curtailing the recognition of scenes with text-rich context. To improve upon them the present study introduces BLIVA an augmented version of InstructBLIP with Visual Assistant. BLIVA incorporates the query embeddings from InstructBLIP and also directly projects encoded patch embeddings into the LLM a technique inspired by LLaVA. This approach assists the model to capture intricate details potentially missed during the query decoding process. Empirical evidence demonstrates that our model BLIVA significantly enhances performance in processing text-rich VQA benchmarks (up to 17.7637; in OCR-VQA benchmark) and in undertaking general (not particularly text-rich) VQA benchmarks (up to 7.937; in Visual Spatial Reasoning benchmark) and achieved 17.7237; overall improvement in a comprehensive multimodal LLM benchmark (MME) comparing to our baseline InstructBLIP. BLIVA demonstrates significant capability in decoding real-world images irrespective of text presence. To demonstrate the broad industry applications enabled by BLIVA we evaluate the model using a new dataset comprising YouTube thumbnails paired with question-answer sets across 11 diverse categories.

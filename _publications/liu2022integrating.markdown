Text45;to45;image AI are capable of generating novel images for inspiration but their applications for 3D design workflows and how designers can build 3D models using AI45;provided inspiration have not yet been explored. To investigate this we integrated DALL45;E GPT45;3 and CLIP within a CAD software in 3DALL45;E a plugin that generates 2D image inspiration for 3D design. 3DALL45;E allows users to construct text and image prompts based on what they are modeling. In a study with 13 designers we found that designers saw great potential in 3DALL45;E within their workflows and could use text45;to45;image AI to produce reference images prevent design fixation and inspire design considerations. We elaborate on prompting patterns observed across 3D modeling tasks and provide measures of prompt complexity observed across participants. From our findings we discuss how 3DALL45;E can merge with existing generative design workflows and propose prompt bibliographies as a form of human45;AI design history.

Text-to-image AI are capable of generating novel images for inspiration, but
their applications for 3D design workflows and how designers can build 3D
models using AI-provided inspiration have not yet been explored. To investigate
this, we integrated DALL-E, GPT-3, and CLIP within a CAD software in 3DALL-E, a
plugin that generates 2D image inspiration for 3D design. 3DALL-E allows users
to construct text and image prompts based on what they are modeling. In a study
with 13 designers, we found that designers saw great potential in 3DALL-E
within their workflows and could use text-to-image AI to produce reference
images, prevent design fixation, and inspire design considerations. We
elaborate on prompting patterns observed across 3D modeling tasks and provide
measures of prompt complexity observed across participants. From our findings,
we discuss how 3DALL-E can merge with existing generative design workflows and
propose prompt bibliographies as a form of human-AI design history.

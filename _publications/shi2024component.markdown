Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions. Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework45;centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks including EIF. Despite these efforts there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components45;ranging from visual perception to action execution45;on task performance. To address this gap we introduce OPEx a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks Observer Planner and Executor. Through extensive evaluations we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance. Furthermore we innovate within this space by deploying a multi45;agent dialogue strategy on a TextWorld counterpart further enhancing task performance. Our findings reveal that LLM45;centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes identify visual perception and low45;level action execution as critical bottlenecks and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi45;agent framework further elevates performance.

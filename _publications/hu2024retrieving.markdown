Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in recent
years due to their impressive performance. While considerable research has
evaluated these models from various perspectives, the extent to which LLMs can
perform implicit and explicit emotion retrieval remains largely unexplored. To
address this gap, this study investigates LLMs' emotion retrieval capabilities
in commonsense. Through extensive experiments involving multiple models, we
systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs on emotion retrieval. Specifically,
we propose a supervised contrastive probing method to verify LLMs' performance
for implicit and explicit emotion retrieval, as well as the diversity of the
emotional events they retrieve. The results offer valuable insights into the
strengths and limitations of LLMs in handling emotion retrieval.

Benchmarks play a significant role in the current evaluation of Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet they often overlook the models' abilities to
capture the nuances of human language, primarily focusing on evaluating
embedded knowledge and technical skills. To address this gap, our study
evaluates how well LLMs understand context-dependent expressions from a
pragmatic standpoint, specifically in Korean. We use both Multiple-Choice
Questions (MCQs) for automatic evaluation and Open-Ended Questions (OEQs)
assessed by human experts. Our results show that GPT-4 leads with scores of
81.11 in MCQs and 85.69 in OEQs, closely followed by HyperCLOVA X.
Additionally, while few-shot learning generally improves performance,
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting tends to encourage literal interpretations,
which may limit effective pragmatic inference. Our findings highlight the need
for LLMs to better understand and generate language that reflects human
communicative norms.

Metaphor and humor share a lot of common ground, and metaphor is one of the
most common humorous mechanisms. This study focuses on the humorous capacity of
multimodal metaphors, which has not received due attention in the community. We
take inspiration from the Incongruity Theory of humor, the Conceptual Metaphor
Theory, and the annotation scheme behind the VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus, and
developed a novel annotation scheme for humorous multimodal metaphor use in
image-caption pairs. We create the Hummus Dataset of Humorous Multimodal
Metaphor Use, providing expert annotation on 1k image-caption pairs sampled
from the New Yorker Caption Contest corpus. Using the dataset, we test
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to
detect and understand humorous multimodal metaphor use. Our experiments show
that current MLLMs still struggle with processing humorous multimodal
metaphors, particularly with regard to integrating visual and textual
information. We release our dataset and code at
github.com/xiaoyuisrain/humorous-multimodal-metaphor-use.

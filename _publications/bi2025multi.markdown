Automating structured clinical interviews could revolutionize mental
healthcare accessibility, yet existing large language models (LLMs) approaches
fail to align with psychiatric diagnostic protocols. We present MAGI, the first
framework that transforms the gold-standard Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI) into automatic computational workflows through coordinated
multi-agent collaboration. MAGI dynamically navigates clinical logic via four
specialized agents: 1) an interview tree guided navigation agent adhering to
the MINI's branching structure, 2) an adaptive question agent blending
diagnostic probing, explaining, and empathy, 3) a judgment agent validating
whether the response from participants meet the node, and 4) a diagnosis Agent
generating Psychometric Chain-of- Thought (PsyCoT) traces that explicitly map
symptoms to clinical criteria. Experimental results on 1,002 real-world
participants covering depression, generalized anxiety, social anxiety and
suicide shows that MAGI advances LLM- assisted mental health assessment by
combining clinical rigor, conversational adaptability, and explainable
reasoning.

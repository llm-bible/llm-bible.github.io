Despite the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) as writing assistants,
they are plagued by issues like coherence and fluency of the model output,
trustworthiness, ownership of the generated content, and predictability of
model performance, thereby limiting their usability. In this position paper, we
propose to adopt Norman's seven stages of action as a framework to approach the
interaction design of intelligent writing assistants. We illustrate the
framework's applicability to writing tasks by providing an example of software
tutorial authoring. The paper also discusses the framework as a tool to
synthesize research on the interaction design of LLM-based tools and presents
examples of tools that support the stages of action. Finally, we briefly
outline the potential of a framework for human-LLM interaction research.

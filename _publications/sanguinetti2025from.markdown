This work explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate user
preferences into energy optimization constraints for home appliances. We
describe a task where natural language user utterances are converted into
formal constraints for smart appliances, within the broader context of a
renewable energy community (REC) and in the Italian scenario. We evaluate the
effectiveness of various LLMs currently available for Italian in translating
these preferences resorting to classical zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning settings, using a pilot dataset of Italian user requests paired with
corresponding formal constraint representation. Our contributions include
establishing a baseline performance for this task, publicly releasing the
dataset and code for further research, and providing insights on observed best
practices and limitations of LLMs in this particular domain

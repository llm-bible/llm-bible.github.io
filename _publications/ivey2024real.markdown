Studying and building datasets for dialogue tasks is both expensive and
time-consuming due to the need to recruit, train, and collect data from study
participants. In response, much recent work has sought to use large language
models (LLMs) to simulate both human-human and human-LLM interactions, as they
have been shown to generate convincingly human-like text in many settings.
However, to what extent do LLM-based simulations \textit\{actually\} reflect
human dialogues? In this work, we answer this question by generating a
large-scale dataset of 100,000 paired LLM-LLM and human-LLM dialogues from the
WildChat dataset and quantifying how well the LLM simulations align with their
human counterparts. Overall, we find relatively low alignment between
simulations and human interactions, demonstrating a systematic divergence along
the multiple textual properties, including style and content. Further, in
comparisons of English, Chinese, and Russian dialogues, we find that models
perform similarly. Our results suggest that LLMs generally perform better when
the human themself writes in a way that is more similar to the LLM's own style.

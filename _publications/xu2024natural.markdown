Prompt45;based learning is a new language model training paradigm that adapts the Pre45;trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks which revitalizes the performance benchmarks across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Instead of using a fixed prompt template to fine45;tune the model some research demonstrates the effectiveness of searching for the prompt via optimization. Such prompt optimization process of prompt45;based learning on PLMs also gives insight into generating adversarial prompts to mislead the model raising concerns about the adversarial vulnerability of this paradigm. Recent studies have shown that universal adversarial triggers (UATs) can be generated to alter not only the predictions of the target PLMs but also the prediction of corresponding Prompt45;based Fine45;tuning Models (PFMs) under the prompt45;based learning paradigm. However UATs found in previous works are often unreadable tokens or characters and can be easily distinguished from natural texts with adaptive defenses. In this work we consider the naturalness of the UATs and develop textit123;LinkPrompt125; an adversarial attack algorithm to generate UATs by a gradient45;based beam search algorithm that not only effectively attacks the target PLMs and PFMs but also maintains the naturalness among the trigger tokens. Extensive results demonstrate the effectiveness of textit123;LinkPrompt125; as well as the transferability of UATs generated by textit123;LinkPrompt125; to open45;sourced Large Language Model (LLM) Llama2 and API45;accessed LLM GPT45;3.545;turbo.

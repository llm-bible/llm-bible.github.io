Attribute45;controlled translation (ACT) is a subtask of machine translation that involves controlling stylistic or linguistic attributes (like formality and gender) of translation outputs. While ACT has garnered attention in recent years due to its usefulness in real45;world applications progress in the task is currently limited by dataset availability since most prior approaches rely on supervised methods. To address this limitation we propose Retrieval and Attribute45;Marking enhanced Prompting (RAMP) which leverages large multilingual language models to perform ACT in few45;shot and zero45;shot settings. RAMP improves generation accuracy over the standard prompting approach by (1) incorporating a semantic similarity retrieval component for selecting similar in45;context examples and (2) marking in45;context examples with attribute annotations. Our comprehensive experiments show that RAMP is a viable approach in both zero45;shot and few45;shot settings.

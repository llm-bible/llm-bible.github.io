Large Language Models (LLMs) are pivotal AI agents in complex tasks but still
face challenges in open decision-making problems within complex scenarios. To
address this, we use the language logic game ``Who is Undercover?'' (WIU) as an
experimental platform to propose the Multi-Perspective Team Tactic (MPTT)
framework. MPTT aims to cultivate LLMs' human-like language expression logic,
multi-dimensional thinking, and self-perception in complex scenarios. By
alternating speaking and voting sessions, integrating techniques like
self-perspective, identity-determination, self-reflection, self-summary and
multi-round find-teammates, LLM agents make rational decisions through
strategic concealment and communication, fostering human-like trust.
Preliminary results show that MPTT, combined with WIU, leverages LLMs'
cognitive capabilities to create a decision-making framework that can simulate
real society. This framework aids minority groups in communication and
expression, promoting fairness and diversity in decision-making. Additionally,
our Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that LLMs can learn and align
with human behaviors through interactive, indicating their potential for active
participation in societal decision-making.

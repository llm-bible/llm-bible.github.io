The advent of vision45;language models fosters the interactive conversations between AI45;enabled models and humans. Yet applying these models into clinics must deal with daunting challenges around large45;scale training data financial and computational resources. Here we propose a cost45;effective instruction learning framework for conversational pathology named as CLOVER. CLOVER only trains a lightweight module and uses instruction tuning while freezing the parameters of the large language model. Instead of using costly GPT45;4 we propose well45;designed prompts on GPT45;3.5 for building generation45;based instructions emphasizing the utility of pathological knowledge derived from the Internet source. To augment the use of instructions we construct a high45;quality set of template45;based instructions in the context of digital pathology. From two benchmark datasets our findings reveal the strength of hybrid45;form instructions in the visual question45;answer in pathology. Extensive results show the cost45;effectiveness of CLOVER in answering both open45;ended and closed45;ended questions where CLOVER outperforms strong baselines that possess 37 times more training parameters and use instruction data generated from GPT45;4. Through the instruction tuning CLOVER exhibits robustness of few45;shot learning in the external clinical dataset. These findings demonstrate that cost45;effective modeling of CLOVER could accelerate the adoption of rapid conversational applications in the landscape of digital pathology.

As robots take on caregiving roles, ensuring equitable and unbiased
interactions with diverse populations is critical. Although Large Language
Models (LLMs) serve as key components in shaping robotic behavior, speech, and
decision-making, these models may encode and propagate societal biases, leading
to disparities in care based on demographic factors. This paper examines how
LLM-generated responses shape robot caregiving characteristics and
responsibilities when prompted with different demographic information related
to sex, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, nationality, disability, and age.
Findings show simplified descriptions for disability and age, lower sentiment
for disability and LGBTQ+ identities, and distinct clustering patterns
reinforcing stereotypes in caregiving narratives. These results emphasize the
need for ethical and inclusive HRI design.

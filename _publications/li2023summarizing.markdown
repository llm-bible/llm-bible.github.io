We present PeerSum a novel dataset for generating meta45;reviews of scientific papers. The meta45;reviews can be interpreted as abstractive summaries of reviews multi45;turn discussions and the paper abstract. These source documents have rich inter45;document relationships with an explicit hierarchical conversational structure cross45;references and (occasionally) conflicting information. To introduce the structural inductive bias into pre45;trained language models we introduce Rammer ( Relationship45;aware Multi45;task Meta45;review Generator) a model that uses sparse attention based on the conversational structure and a multi45;task training objective that predicts metadata features (e.g. review ratings). Our experimental results show that Rammer outperforms other strong baseline models in terms of a suite of automatic evaluation metrics. Further analyses however reveal that RAMMER and other models struggle to handle conflicts in source documents of PeerSum suggesting meta45;review generation is a challenging task and a promising avenue for further research.

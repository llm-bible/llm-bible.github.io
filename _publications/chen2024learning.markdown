This study investigates the potential of using ChatGPT as a teachable agent
to support students' learning by teaching process, specifically in programming
education. While learning by teaching is an effective pedagogical strategy for
promoting active learning, traditional teachable agents have limitations,
particularly in facilitating natural language dialogue. Our research explored
whether ChatGPT, with its ability to engage learners in natural conversations,
can support this process. The findings reveal that interacting with ChatGPT
improves students' knowledge gains and programming abilities, particularly in
writing readable and logically sound code. However, it had limited impact on
developing learners' error-correction skills, likely because ChatGPT tends to
generate correct code, reducing opportunities for students to practice
debugging. Additionally, students' self-regulated learning (SRL) abilities
improved, suggesting that teaching ChatGPT fosters learners' higher
self-efficacy and better implementation of SRL strategies. This study discussed
the role of natural dialogue in fostering socialized learning by teaching, and
explored ChatGPT's specific contributions in supporting students' SRL through
the learning by teaching process. Overall, the study highlights ChatGPT's
potential as a teachable agent, offering insights for future research on
ChatGPT-supported education.

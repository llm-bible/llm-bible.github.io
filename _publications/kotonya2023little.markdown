This paper describes and analyzes our participation in the 2023 Eval4NLP shared task which focuses on assessing the effectiveness of prompt-based techniques to empower Large Language Models to handle the task of quality estimation particularly in the context of evaluating machine translations and summaries. We conducted systematic experiments with various prompting techniques including standard prompting prompts informed by annotator instructions and innovative chain-of-thought prompting. In addition we integrated these approaches with zero-shot and one-shot learning methods to maximize the efficacy of our evaluation procedures. Our work reveals that combining these approaches using a small open source model (orca_mini_v3_7B) yields competitive results.

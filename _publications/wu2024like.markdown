The human-computer interaction (HCI) research community has a longstanding
interest in exploring the mismatch between users' actual experiences and
expectation toward new technologies, for instance, large language models
(LLMs). In this study, we compared users' (N = 38) initial expectations against
their post-interaction perceptions of two LLM-powered mental well-being
intervention activity recommendation systems. Both systems have a built-in LLM
to recommend a personalized well-being intervention activity, but one system
(Sunnie) has an anthropomorphic conversational interaction design via elements
such as appearance, persona, and natural conversation. Results showed that user
engagement was high with both systems, and both systems exceeded users'
expectations along the utility dimension, highlighting AI's potential to offer
useful intervention activity recommendations. In addition, Sunnie further
outperformed the non-anthropomorphic baseline system in relational warmth.
These findings suggest that anthropomorphic conversational interaction design
may be particularly effective in fostering warmth in mental health support
contexts.

AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments understand tasks and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX) a comprehensive large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents. Their capabilities of completing complex tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices are trained and evaluated with the proposed dataset. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from 110 popular mobile applications which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing mobile device-control datasets e.g. MoTIF AitW etc. AMEX includes three levels of annotations GUI interactive element grounding GUI screen and element functionality descriptions and complex natural language instructions each averaging 13 steps with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally we develop a baseline model SPHINX Agent and compare its performance across state-of-the-art agents trained on other datasets. To facilitate further research we open-source our dataset models and relevant evaluation tools. The project is available at https://yuxiangchai.github.io/AMEX/"

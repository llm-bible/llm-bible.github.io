Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and are a powerful enabler for interactive systems. However, they still face challenges in long-term interactions that require adaptation towards the user as well as contextual knowledge and understanding of the ever-changing environment. To overcome these challenges, holistic memory modeling is required to efficiently retrieve and store relevant information across interaction sessions for suitable responses. Cognitive AI, which aims to simulate the human thought process in a computerized model, highlights interesting aspects, such as thoughts, memory mechanisms, and decision-making, that can contribute towards improved memory modeling for LLMs. Inspired by these cognitive AI principles, we propose our memory framework CAIM. CAIM consists of three modules: 1.) The Memory Controller as the central decision unit; 2.) the Memory Retrieval, which filters relevant data for interaction upon request; and 3.) the Post-Thinking, which maintains the memory storage. We compare CAIM against existing approaches, focusing on metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness, contextual coherence, and memory storage. The results demonstrate that CAIM outperforms baseline frameworks across different metrics, highlighting its context-awareness and potential to improve long-term human-AI interactions.

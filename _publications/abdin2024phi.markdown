We present phi-4, a 14-billion parameter language model developed with a
training recipe that is centrally focused on data quality. Unlike most language
models, where pre-training is based primarily on organic data sources such as
web content or code, phi-4 strategically incorporates synthetic data throughout
the training process. While previous models in the Phi family largely distill
the capabilities of a teacher model (specifically GPT-4), phi-4 substantially
surpasses its teacher model on STEM-focused QA capabilities, giving evidence
that our data-generation and post-training techniques go beyond distillation.
Despite minimal changes to the phi-3 architecture, phi-4 achieves strong
performance relative to its size -- especially on reasoning-focused benchmarks
-- due to improved data, training curriculum, and innovations in the
post-training scheme.

The theory of Conceptual Spaces is an influential cognitive-linguistic framework for representing the meaning of concepts. Conceptual spaces are constructed from a set of quality dimensions which essentially correspond to primitive perceptual features (e.g. hue or size). These quality dimensions are usually learned from human judgements which means that applications of conceptual spaces tend to be limited to narrow domains (e.g. modelling colour or taste). Encouraged by recent findings about the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn perceptually grounded representations we explore the potential of such models for learning conceptual spaces. Our experiments show that LLMs can indeed be used for learning meaningful representations to some extent. However we also find that fine-tuned models of the BERT family are able to match or even outperform the largest GPT-3 model despite being 2 to 3 orders of magnitude smaller.

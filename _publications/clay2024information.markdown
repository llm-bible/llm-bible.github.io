LLMs are frequently used tools for conversational generation. Without
additional information LLMs can generate lower quality responses due to lacking
relevant content and hallucinations, as well as the perception of poor
emotional capability, and an inability to maintain a consistent character.
Knowledge graphs are commonly used forms of external knowledge and may provide
solutions to these challenges. This paper introduces three proposals, utilizing
knowledge graphs to enhance LLM generation. Firstly, dynamic knowledge graph
embeddings and recommendation could allow for the integration of new
information and the selection of relevant knowledge for response generation.
Secondly, storing entities with emotional values as additional features may
provide knowledge that is better emotionally aligned with the user input.
Thirdly, integrating character information through narrative bubbles would
maintain character consistency, as well as introducing a structure that would
readily incorporate new information.

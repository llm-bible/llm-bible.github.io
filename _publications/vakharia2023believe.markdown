Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at text manipulation -- tasks such as
machine translation and text summarization. However, these models can also be
prone to hallucination, which can be detrimental to the faithfulness of any
answers that the model provides. Recent works in combating hallucinations in
LLMs deal with identifying hallucinated sentences and categorizing the
different ways in which models hallucinate. This paper takes a deep dive into
LLM behavior with respect to hallucinations, defines a token-level approach to
identifying different kinds of hallucinations, and further utilizes this
token-level tagging to improve the interpretability and faithfulness of LLMs in
dialogue summarization tasks. Through this, the paper presents a new, enhanced
dataset and a new training paradigm.

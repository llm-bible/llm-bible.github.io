Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in advancing
artificial general intelligence (AGI), leading to the development of
increasingly large models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA-405B. However, scaling up
model sizes results in exponentially higher computational costs and energy
consumption, making these models impractical for academic researchers and
businesses with limited resources. At the same time, Small Models (SMs) are
frequently used in practical settings, although their significance is currently
underestimated. This raises important questions about the role of small models
in the era of LLMs, a topic that has received limited attention in prior
research. In this work, we systematically examine the relationship between LLMs
and SMs from two key perspectives: Collaboration and Competition. We hope this
survey provides valuable insights for practitioners, fostering a deeper
understanding of the contribution of small models and promoting more efficient
use of computational resources. The code is available at

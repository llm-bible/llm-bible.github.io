Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have stimulated a surge of research aimed at extending their applications to the visual domain. While these models exhibit promise in generating abstract image captions and facilitating natural conversations their performance on text-rich images still requires improvement. In this paper we introduce Contrastive Reading Model (Cream) a novel neural architecture designed to enhance the language-image understanding capability of LLMs by capturing intricate details that are often overlooked in existing methods. Cream combines vision and auxiliary encoders fortified by a contrastive feature alignment technique to achieve a more effective comprehension of language information in visually situated contexts within the images. Our approach bridges the gap between vision and language understanding paving the way for the development of more sophisticated Document Intelligence Assistants. Through rigorous evaluations across diverse visually-situated language understanding tasks that demand reasoning capabilities we demonstrate the compelling performance of Cream positioning it as a prominent model in the field of visual document understanding. We provide our codebase and newly-generated datasets at https://github.com/naver-ai/cream .

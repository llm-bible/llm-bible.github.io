This paper explores how AI-owners can develop safeguards for AI-generated
content by drawing from established codes of conduct and ethical standards in
other content-creation industries. It delves into the current state of ethical
awareness on Large Language Models (LLMs). By dissecting the mechanism of
content generation by LLMs, four key areas (upstream/downstream and at user
prompt/answer), where safeguards could be effectively applied, are identified.
A comparative analysis of these four areas follows and includes an evaluation
of the existing ethical safeguards in terms of cost, effectiveness, and
alignment with established industry practices. The paper's key argument is that
existing IT-related ethical codes, while adequate for traditional IT
engineering, are inadequate for the challenges posed by LLM-based content
generation. Drawing from established practices within journalism, we propose
potential standards for businesses involved in distributing and selling
LLM-generated content. Finally, potential conflicts of interest between dataset
curation at upstream and ethical benchmarking downstream are highlighted to
underscore the need for a broader evaluation beyond mere output. This study
prompts a nuanced conversation around ethical implications in this rapidly
evolving field of content generation.

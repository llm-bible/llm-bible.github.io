Recently pre-trained models have been the dominant paradigm in natural language processing. They achieved remarkable state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of related tasks such as textual entailment natural language inference question answering etc. BERT proposed by Devlin et.al. has achieved a better marked result in GLUE leaderboard with a deep transformer architecture. Despite its soaring popularity however BERT has not yet been applied to answer selection. This task is different from others with a few nuances first modeling the relevance and correctness of candidates matters compared to semantic relatedness and syntactic structure; second the length of an answer may be different from other candidates and questions. In this paper. we are the first to explore the performance of fine-tuning BERT for answer selection. We achieved STOA results across five popular datasets demonstrating the success of pre-trained models in this task.

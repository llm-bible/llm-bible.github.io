Long-context large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
advancements, driven by techniques like Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) (Su et
al., 2023) and its extensions (Chen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024c; Peng et
al., 2023). By adjusting RoPE parameters and incorporating training data with
extended contexts, we can train performant models with considerably longer
input sequences. However, existing RoPE-based methods exhibit performance
limitations when applied to extended context lengths. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis of various attention mechanisms, including RoPE, No
Positional Embedding (NoPE), and Query-Key Normalization (QK-Norm), identifying
their strengths and shortcomings in long-context modeling. Our investigation
identifies distinctive attention patterns in these methods and highlights their
impact on long-context performance, providing valuable insights for
architectural design. Building on these findings, we propose a novel
architectural based on a hybrid attention mechanism that not only surpasses
conventional RoPE-based transformer models in long context tasks but also
achieves competitive performance on benchmarks requiring shorter context
lengths.

Poetry generation has been a challenging task in the field of Natural Language Processing as it requires the model to understand the nuances of language sentiment and style. In this paper we propose using Large Language Models to generate Vietnamese poems of various genres from natural language prompts thereby facilitating an intuitive process with enhanced content control. Our most efficacious model the GPT-3 Babbage variant achieves a custom evaluation score of 0.8 specifically tailored to the luc bat genre of Vietnamese poetry. Furthermore we also explore the idea of paraphrasing poems into normal text prompts and yield a relatively high score of 0.781 in the luc bat genre. This experiment presents the potential for cross-Language poem-to-poem translation with translated poems as the inputs while concurrently maintaining complete control over the generated content.

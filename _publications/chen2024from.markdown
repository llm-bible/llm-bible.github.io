Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two powerful
approaches for building autonomous agents. However, due to limited
understanding of the game environment, agents often resort to inefficient
exploration and trial-and-error, struggling to develop long-term strategies or
make decisions. We propose a method that extracts experience from interaction
records to model the underlying laws of the game environment, using these
experience as internal motivation to guide agents. These experience, expressed
in language, are highly flexible and can either assist agents in reasoning
directly or be transformed into rewards for guiding training. Our evaluation
results in Crafter demonstrate that both RL and LLM agents benefit from these
experience, leading to improved overall performance.

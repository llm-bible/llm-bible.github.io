The scaling of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized their capabilities in various tasks yet this growth must be matched with efficient computational strategies. The Mixture45;of45;Experts (MoE) architecture stands out for its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training costs. Despite their advantages current MoE models often display parameter inefficiency. For instance a pre45;trained MoE45;based LLM with 52 billion parameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion parameters. Being a crucial part of MoE current routers in different layers independently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information potentially leading to suboptimal token45;expert combinations and the parameter inefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue we introduce the Layerwise Recurrent Router for Mixture45;of45;Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across consecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly computed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE45;based language models consistently outperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore RMoE integrates a novel computation stage orthogonal to existing methods allowing seamless compatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoEs gains to its effective cross45;layer information sharing which also improves expert selection and diversity. Our code is at https://github.com/qiuzh20/RMoE

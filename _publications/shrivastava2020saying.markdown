Despite end45;to45;end neural systems making significant progress in the last decade for task45;oriented as well as chit45;chat based dialogue systems most dialogue systems rely on hybrid approaches which use a combination of rule45;based retrieval and generative approaches for generating a set of ranked responses. Such dialogue systems need to rely on a fallback mechanism to respond to out45;of45;domain or novel user queries which are not answerable within the scope of the dialog system. While dialog systems today rely on static and unnatural responses like I dont know the answer to that question or Im not sure about that we design a neural approach which generates responses which are contextually aware with the user query as well as say no to the user. Such customized responses provide paraphrasing ability and contextualization as well as improve the interaction with the user and reduce dialogue monotonicity. Our simple approach makes use of rules over dependency parses and a text45;to45;text transformer fine45;tuned on synthetic data of question45;response pairs generating highly relevant grammatical as well as diverse questions. We perform automatic and manual evaluations to demonstrate the efficacy of the system.

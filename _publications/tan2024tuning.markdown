Large Language Models (LLMs) have catalyzed transformative advances across a spectrum of natural language processing tasks through few45;shot or zero45;shot prompting bypassing the need for parameter tuning. While convenient this modus operandi aggravates hallucination concerns particularly given the enigmatic black45;box nature behind their gigantic model sizes. Such concerns are exacerbated in high45;stakes applications (e.g. healthcare) where unaccountable decision errors can lead to devastating consequences. In contrast human decision45;making relies on nuanced cognitive processes such as the ability to sense and adaptively correct misjudgments through conceptual understanding. Drawing inspiration from human cognition we propose an innovative textit123;metacognitive125; approach dubbed textbf123;CLEAR125; to equip LLMs with capabilities for self45;aware error identification and correction. Our framework facilitates the construction of concept45;specific sparse subnetworks that illuminate transparent decision pathways. This provides a novel interface for model textit123;intervention125; after deployment. Our intervention offers compelling advantages (textit123;i125;)~at deployment or inference time our metacognitive LLMs can self45;consciously identify potential mispredictions with minimum human involvement (textit123;ii125;)~the model has the capability to self45;correct its errors efficiently obviating the need for additional tuning and (textit123;iii125;)~the rectification procedure is not only self45;explanatory but also user45;friendly enhancing the interpretability and accessibility of the model. By integrating these metacognitive features our approach pioneers a new path toward engendering greater trustworthiness and accountability in the deployment of LLMs.

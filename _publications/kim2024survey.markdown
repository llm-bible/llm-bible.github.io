In recent years the integration of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field of robotics enabling robots to communicate understand and reason with human45;like proficiency. This paper explores the multifaceted impact of LLMs on robotics addressing key challenges and opportunities for leveraging these models across various domains. By categorizing and analyzing LLM applications within core robotics elements 45;45; communication perception planning and control 45;45; we aim to provide actionable insights for researchers seeking to integrate LLMs into their robotic systems. Our investigation focuses on LLMs developed post45;GPT45;3.5 primarily in text45;based modalities while also considering multimodal approaches for perception and control. We offer comprehensive guidelines and examples for prompt engineering facilitating beginners access to LLM45;based robotics solutions. Through tutorial45;level examples and structured prompt construction we illustrate how LLM45;guided enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into robotics applications. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of LLM45;driven robotics offering a comprehensive overview and practical guidance for harnessing the power of language models in robotics development.

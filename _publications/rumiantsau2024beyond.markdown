Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important in natural
language processing, enabling advanced data analytics through natural language
queries. However, these models often generate "hallucinations"-inaccurate or
fabricated information-that can undermine their reliability in critical
data-driven decision-making. Addressing the challenge of hallucinations is
essential to improve the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLMs in processing
natural language queries. This research focuses on mitigating hallucinations in
LLMs, specifically within the context of data analytics. We introduce and
evaluate four targeted strategies: Structured Output Generation, Strict Rules
Enforcement, System Prompt Enhancements, and Semantic Layer Integration. Our
findings show that these methods are more effective than traditional
fine-tuning approaches in reducing hallucinations, offering a more reliable
framework for deploying LLMs in natural language queries for data analytics.
This research demonstrates the potential of these strategies to enhance the
accuracy of LLM-driven data queries, ensuring more dependable results in
data-driven environments.

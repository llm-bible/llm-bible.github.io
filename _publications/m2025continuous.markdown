Creating personalized and adaptable conversational AI remains a key
challenge. This paper introduces a Continuous Learning Conversational AI (CLCA)
approach, implemented using A2C reinforcement learning, to move beyond static
Large Language Models (LLMs). We use simulated sales dialogues, generated by
LLMs, to train an A2C agent. This agent learns to optimize conversation
strategies for personalization, focusing on engagement and delivering value.
Our system architecture integrates reinforcement learning with LLMs for both
data creation and response selection. This method offers a practical way to
build personalized AI companions that evolve through continuous learning,
advancing beyond traditional static LLM techniques.

We propose a conceptual perspective on prompts for Large Language Models (LLMs) that distinguishes between (1) diegetic prompts (part of the narrative e.g. Once upon a time I saw a fox...) and (2) non45;diegetic prompts (external e.g. Write about the adventures of the fox.). With this lens we study how 129 crowd workers on Prolific write short texts with different user interfaces (1 vs 3 suggestions with/out non45;diegetic prompts; implemented with GPT45;3) When the interface offered multiple suggestions and provided an option for non45;diegetic prompting participants preferred choosing from multiple suggestions over controlling them via non45;diegetic prompts. When participants provided non45;diegetic prompts it was to ask for inspiration topics or facts. Single suggestions in particular were guided both with diegetic and non45;diegetic information. This work informs human45;AI interaction with generative models by revealing that (1) writing non45;diegetic prompts requires effort (2) people combine diegetic and non45;diegetic prompting and (3) they use their draft (i.e. diegetic information) and suggestion timing to strategically guide LLMs.

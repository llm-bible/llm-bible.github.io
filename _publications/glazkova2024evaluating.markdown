Large language models (LLMs) play a crucial role in natural language
processing (NLP) tasks, improving the understanding, generation, and
manipulation of human language across domains such as translating, summarizing,
and classifying text. Previous studies have demonstrated that instruction-based
LLMs can be effectively utilized for data augmentation to generate diverse and
realistic text samples. This study applied prompt-based data augmentation to
detect mentions of green practices in Russian social media. Detecting green
practices in social media aids in understanding their prevalence and helps
formulate recommendations for scaling eco-friendly actions to mitigate
environmental issues. We evaluated several prompts for augmenting texts in a
multi-label classification task, either by rewriting existing datasets using
LLMs, generating new data, or combining both approaches. Our results revealed
that all strategies improved classification performance compared to the models
fine-tuned only on the original dataset, outperforming baselines in most cases.
The best results were obtained with the prompt that paraphrased the original
text while clearly indicating the relevant categories.

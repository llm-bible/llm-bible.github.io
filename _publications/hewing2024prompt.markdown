The rise of large language models (LLMs) has highlighted the importance of
prompt engineering as a crucial technique for optimizing model outputs. While
experimentation with various prompting methods, such as Few-shot,
Chain-of-Thought, and role-based techniques, has yielded promising results,
these advancements remain fragmented across academic papers, blog posts and
anecdotal experimentation. The lack of a single, unified resource to
consolidate the field's knowledge impedes the progress of both research and
practical application. This paper argues for the creation of an overarching
framework that synthesizes existing methodologies into a cohesive overview for
practitioners. Using a design-based research approach, we present the Prompt
Canvas, a structured framework resulting from an extensive literature review on
prompt engineering that captures current knowledge and expertise. By combining
the conceptual foundations and practical strategies identified in prompt
engineering, the Prompt Canvas provides a practical approach for leveraging the
potential of Large Language Models. It is primarily designed as a learning
resource for pupils, students and employees, offering a structured introduction
to prompt engineering. This work aims to contribute to the growing discourse on
prompt engineering by establishing a unified methodology for researchers and
providing guidance for practitioners.

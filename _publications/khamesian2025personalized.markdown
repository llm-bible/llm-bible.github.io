Maintaining a balanced diet is essential for overall health, yet many
individuals struggle with meal planning due to nutritional complexity, time
constraints, and lack of dietary knowledge. Personalized food recommendations
can help address these challenges by tailoring meal plans to individual
preferences, habits, and dietary restrictions. However, existing dietary
recommendation systems often lack adaptability, fail to consider real-world
constraints such as food ingredient availability, and require extensive user
input, making them impractical for sustainable and scalable daily use. To
address these limitations, we introduce NutriGen, a framework based on large
language models (LLM) designed to generate personalized meal plans that align
with user-defined dietary preferences and constraints. By building a
personalized nutrition database and leveraging prompt engineering, our approach
enables LLMs to incorporate reliable nutritional references like the USDA
nutrition database while maintaining flexibility and ease-of-use. We
demonstrate that LLMs have strong potential in generating accurate and
user-friendly food recommendations, addressing key limitations in existing
dietary recommendation systems by providing structured, practical, and scalable
meal plans. Our evaluation shows that Llama 3.1 8B and GPT-3.5 Turbo achieve
the lowest percentage errors of 1.55% and 3.68%, respectively, producing meal
plans that closely align with user-defined caloric targets while minimizing
deviation and improving precision. Additionally, we compared the performance of
DeepSeek V3 against several established models to evaluate its potential in
personalized nutrition planning.

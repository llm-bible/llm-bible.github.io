Recent research on dialogue state tracking (DST) focuses on methods that allow few- and zero-shot transfer to new domains or schemas. However performance gains heavily depend on aggressive data augmentation and fine-tuning of ever larger language model based architectures. In contrast general purpose language models trained on large amounts of diverse data hold the promise of solving any kind of task without task-specific training. We present preliminary experimental results on the ChatGPT research preview showing that ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot DST. Despite our findings we argue that properties inherent to general purpose models limit their ability to replace specialized systems. We further theorize that the in-context learning capabilities of such models will likely become powerful tools to support the development of dedicated and dynamic dialogue state trackers.

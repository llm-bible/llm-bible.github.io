Recent research on dialogue state tracking (DST) focuses on methods that allow few45; and zero45;shot transfer to new domains or schemas. However performance gains heavily depend on aggressive data augmentation and fine45;tuning of ever larger language model based architectures. In contrast general purpose language models trained on large amounts of diverse data hold the promise of solving any kind of task without task45;specific training. We present preliminary experimental results on the ChatGPT research preview showing that ChatGPT achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance in zero45;shot DST. Despite our findings we argue that properties inherent to general purpose models limit their ability to replace specialized systems. We further theorize that the in45;context learning capabilities of such models will likely become powerful tools to support the development of dedicated and dynamic dialogue state trackers.

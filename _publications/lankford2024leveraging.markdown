In an evolving landscape of crisis communication, the need for robust and
adaptable Machine Translation (MT) systems is more pressing than ever,
particularly for low-resource languages. This study presents a comprehensive
exploration of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multilingual LLMs
(MLLMs) to enhance MT capabilities in such scenarios. By focusing on the unique
challenges posed by crisis situations where speed, accuracy, and the ability to
handle a wide range of languages are paramount, this research outlines a novel
approach that combines the cutting-edge capabilities of LLMs with fine-tuning
techniques and community-driven corpus development strategies. At the core of
this study is the development and empirical evaluation of MT systems tailored
for two low-resource language pairs, illustrating the process from initial
model selection and fine-tuning through to deployment. Bespoke systems are
developed and modelled on the recent Covid-19 pandemic. The research highlights
the importance of community involvement in creating highly specialised,
crisis-specific datasets and compares custom GPTs with NLLB-adapted MLLM
models. It identifies fine-tuned MLLM models as offering superior performance
compared with their LLM counterparts. A scalable and replicable model for rapid
MT system development in crisis scenarios is outlined. Our approach enhances
the field of humanitarian technology by offering a blueprint for developing
multilingual communication systems during emergencies.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the development of Video Large Multi45;modal Models (Video45;LMMs) that can handle a wide range of video understanding tasks. These models have the potential to be deployed in real45;world applications such as robotics AI assistants medical surgery and autonomous vehicles. The widespread adoption of Video45;LMMs in our daily lives underscores the importance of ensuring and evaluating their robust performance in mirroring human45;like reasoning and interaction capabilities in complex real45;world contexts. However existing benchmarks for Video45;LMMs primarily focus on general video comprehension abilities and neglect assessing their reasoning capabilities over complex videos in the real45;world context and robustness of these models through the lens of user prompts as text queries. In this paper we present the Complex Video Reasoning and Robustness Evaluation Suite (CVRR45;ES) a novel benchmark that comprehensively assesses the performance of Video45;LMMs across 11 diverse real45;world video dimensions. We evaluate 9 recent models including both open45;source and closed45;source variants and find that most of the Video45;LMMs especially open45;source ones struggle with robustness and reasoning when dealing with complex videos. Based on our analysis we develop a training45;free Dual45;Step Contextual Prompting (DSCP) technique to enhance the performance of existing Video45;LMMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for building the next generation of human45;centric AI systems with advanced robustness and reasoning capabilities.

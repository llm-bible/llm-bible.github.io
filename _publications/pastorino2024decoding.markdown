Previous studies on framing have relied on manual analysis or fine45;tuning models with limited annotated datasets. However pre45;trained models with their diverse training backgrounds offer a promising alternative. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of GPT45;4 GPT45;3.5 Turbo and FLAN45;T5 models in detecting framing in news headlines. We evaluated these models in various scenarios zero45;shot few45;shot with in45;domain examples cross45;domain examples and settings where models explain their predictions. Our results show that explainable predictions lead to more reliable outcomes. GPT45;4 performed exceptionally well in few45;shot settings but often misinterpreted emotional language as framing highlighting a significant challenge. Additionally the results suggest that consistent predictions across multiple models could help identify potential annotation inaccuracies in datasets. Finally we propose a new small dataset for real45;world evaluation on headlines from a diverse set of topics.

Given recent advances in generative AI technology, a key question is how
large language models (LLMs) can enhance acoustic modeling tasks using text
decoding results from a frozen, pretrained automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model. To explore new capabilities in language modeling for speech processing,
we introduce the generative speech transcription error correction (GenSEC)
challenge. This challenge comprises three post-ASR language modeling tasks: (i)
post-ASR transcription correction, (ii) speaker tagging, and (iii) emotion
recognition. These tasks aim to emulate future LLM-based agents handling
voice-based interfaces while remaining accessible to a broad audience by
utilizing open pretrained language models or agent-based APIs. We also discuss
insights from baseline evaluations, as well as lessons learned for designing
future evaluations.

Answering Questions over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA) is key to well45;functioning autonomous language agents in various real45;life applications. To improve the neural45;symbolic reasoning capabilities of language agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) in KGQA we propose the DecompositionAlignment45;Reasoning Agent (DARA) framework. DARA effectively parses questions into formal queries through a dual mechanism high45;level iterative task decomposition and low45;level task grounding. Importantly DARA can be efficiently trained with a small number of high45;quality reasoning trajectories. Our experimental results demonstrate that DARA fine45;tuned on LLMs (e.g. Llama45;245;7B Mistral) outperforms both in45;context learning45;based agents with GPT45;4 and alternative fine45;tuned agents across different benchmarks in zero45;shot evaluation making such models more accessible for real45;life applications. We also show that DARA attains performance comparable to state45;of45;the45;art enumerating45;and45;ranking45;based methods for KGQA.

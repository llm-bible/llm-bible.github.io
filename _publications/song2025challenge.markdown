API-driven chatbot systems are increasingly integral to software engineering
applications, yet their effectiveness hinges on accurately generating and
executing API calls. This is particularly challenging in scenarios requiring
multi-step interactions with complex parameterization and nested API
dependencies. Addressing these challenges, this work contributes to the
evaluation and assessment of AI-based software development through three key
advancements: (1) the introduction of a novel dataset specifically designed for
benchmarking API function selection, parameter generation, and nested API
execution; (2) an empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art language models,
analyzing their performance across varying task complexities in API function
generation and parameter accuracy; and (3) a hybrid approach to API routing,
combining general-purpose large language models for API selection with
fine-tuned models and prompt engineering for parameter generation. These
innovations significantly improve API execution in chatbot systems, offering
practical methodologies for enhancing software design, testing, and operational
workflows in real-world software engineering contexts.

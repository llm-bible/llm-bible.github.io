This paper introduces Knowledge Representation Augmented Generation (KRAG), a
novel framework designed to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) within domain-specific applications. KRAG points to the strategic
inclusion of critical knowledge entities and relationships that are typically
absent in standard data sets and which LLMs do not inherently learn. In the
context of legal applications, we present Soft PROLEG, an implementation model
under KRAG, which uses inference graphs to aid LLMs in delivering structured
legal reasoning, argumentation, and explanations tailored to user inquiries.
The integration of KRAG, either as a standalone framework or in tandem with
retrieval augmented generation (RAG), markedly improves the ability of language
models to navigate and solve the intricate challenges posed by legal texts and
terminologies. This paper details KRAG's methodology, its implementation
through Soft PROLEG, and potential broader applications, underscoring its
significant role in advancing natural language understanding and processing in
specialized knowledge domains.

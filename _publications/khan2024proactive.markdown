Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in text-based
tasks but often struggle to provide actionable guidance in real-world physical
environments. This is because of their inability to recognize their limited
understanding of the user's physical context. We present SituationalLLM, a
novel approach that integrates structured scene information into an LLM to
deliver proactive, context-aware assistance. By encoding objects, attributes,
and relationships in a custom Scene Graph Language, SituationalLLM actively
identifies gaps in environmental context and seeks clarifications during user
interactions. This behavior emerges from training on the Situational Awareness
Database for Instruct-Tuning (SAD-Instruct), which combines diverse,
scenario-specific scene graphs with iterative, dialogue-based refinements.
Experimental results indicate that SituationalLLM outperforms generic LLM
baselines in task specificity, reliability, and adaptability, paving the way
for environment-aware AI assistants capable of delivering robust, user-centric
guidance under real-world constraints.

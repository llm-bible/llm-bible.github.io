The language generation and reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) have enabled conversational systems with impressive performance in a
variety of tasks, from code generation, to composing essays, to passing STEM
and legal exams, to a new paradigm for knowledge search. Besides those
short-term use applications, LLMs are increasingly used to help with real-life
goals or tasks that take a long time to complete, involving multiple sessions
across days, weeks, months, or even years. Thus to enable conversational
systems for long term interactions and tasks, we need language-based agents
that can plan for long horizons. Traditionally, such capabilities were
addressed by reinforcement learning agents with hierarchical planning
capabilities. In this work, we explore a novel architecture where the LLM acts
as the meta-controller deciding the agent's next macro-action, and tool use
augmented LLM-based option policies execute the selected macro-action. We
instantiate this framework for a specific set of macro-actions enabling
adaptive planning for users' personal plans through conversation and follow-up
questions collecting user feedback. We show how this paradigm can be applicable
in scenarios ranging from tutoring for academic and non-academic tasks to
conversational coaching for personal health plans.

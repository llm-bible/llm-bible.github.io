This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to score and explain short-answer assessments in K-12 science. While existing methods can score more structured math and computer science assessments they often do not provide explanations for the scores. Our study focuses on employing GPT-4 for automated assessment in middle school Earth Science combining few-shot and active learning with chain-of-thought reasoning. Using a human-in-the-loop approach we successfully score and provide meaningful explanations for formative assessment responses. A systematic analysis of our methods pros and cons sheds light on the potential for human-in-the-loop techniques to enhance automated grading for open-ended science assessments.

In an era where cultural preservation is increasingly intertwined with
technological innovation, this study introduces a groundbreaking approach to
promoting and safeguarding the rich heritage of Taiwanese Hakka culture through
the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced chatbot.
Traditional large language models (LLMs), while powerful, often fall short in
delivering accurate and contextually rich responses, particularly in culturally
specific domains. By integrating external databases with generative AI models,
RAG technology bridges this gap, empowering chatbots to not only provide
precise answers but also resonate deeply with the cultural nuances that are
crucial for authentic interactions. This study delves into the intricate
process of augmenting the chatbot's knowledge base with targeted cultural data,
specifically curated to reflect the unique aspects of Hakka traditions,
language, and practices. Through dynamic information retrieval, the
RAG-enhanced chatbot becomes a versatile tool capable of handling complex
inquiries that demand an in-depth understanding of Hakka cultural context. This
is particularly significant in an age where digital platforms often dilute
cultural identities, making the role of culturally aware AI systems more
critical than ever. System usability studies conducted as part of our research
reveal a marked improvement in both user satisfaction and engagement,
highlighting the chatbot's effectiveness in fostering a deeper connection with
Hakka culture. The feedback underscores the potential of RAG technology to not
only enhance user experience but also to serve as a vital instrument in the
broader mission of ethnic mainstreaming and cultural celebration.

This study introduces Conversation Routines (CR), a structured prompt
engineering framework for developing task-oriented dialog systems using Large
Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs demonstrate remarkable natural language
understanding capabilities, engineering them to reliably execute complex
business workflows remains challenging. The proposed CR framework enables the
development of Conversation Agentic Systems (CAS) through natural language
specifications, embedding task-oriented logic within LLM prompts. This approach
provides a systematic methodology for designing and implementing complex
conversational workflows while maintaining behavioral consistency. We
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through two proof-of-concept
implementations: a Train Ticket Booking System and an Interactive
Troubleshooting Copilot. These case studies validate CR's capability to encode
sophisticated behavioral patterns and decision logic while preserving natural
conversational flexibility. Results show that CR enables domain experts to
design conversational workflows in natural language while leveraging custom
functions (tools) developed by software engineers, creating an efficient
division of responsibilities where developers focus on core API implementation
and domain experts handle conversation design. While the framework shows
promise in accessibility and adaptability, we identify key challenges including
computational overhead, non-deterministic behavior, and domain-specific logic
optimization. Future research directions include CR evaluation methods based on
prompt engineering frameworks driven by goal-oriented grading criteria,
improving scalability for complex multi-agent interactions, and enhancing
system robustness to address the identified limitations across diverse business
applications.

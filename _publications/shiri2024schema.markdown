Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities in
processing natural language data, promising efficient knowledge extraction from
diverse textual sources to enhance situational awareness and support
decision-making. However, concerns arise due to their susceptibility to
hallucination, resulting in contextually inaccurate content. This work focuses
on harnessing LLMs for automated Event Extraction, introducing a new method to
address hallucination by decomposing the task into Event Detection and Event
Argument Extraction. Moreover, the proposed method integrates dynamic
schema-aware augmented retrieval examples into prompts tailored for each
specific inquiry, thereby extending and adapting advanced prompting techniques
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Evaluation findings on prominent event
extraction benchmarks and results from a synthesized benchmark illustrate the
method's superior performance compared to baseline approaches.

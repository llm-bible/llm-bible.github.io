Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant capabilities in processing natural language data promising efficient knowledge extraction from diverse textual sources to enhance situational awareness and support decision45;making. However concerns arise due to their susceptibility to hallucination resulting in contextually inaccurate content. This work focuses on harnessing LLMs for automated Event Extraction introducing a new method to address hallucination by decomposing the task into Event Detection and Event Argument Extraction. Moreover the proposed method integrates dynamic schema45;aware augmented retrieval examples into prompts tailored for each specific inquiry thereby extending and adapting advanced prompting techniques such as Retrieval45;Augmented Generation. Evaluation findings on prominent event extraction benchmarks and results from a synthesized benchmark illustrate the methods superior performance compared to baseline approaches.

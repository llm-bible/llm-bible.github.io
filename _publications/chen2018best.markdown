The past year has witnessed rapid advances in sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) modeling for Machine Translation (MT). The classic RNN-based approaches to MT were first out-performed by the convolutional seq2seq model which was then out-performed by the more recent Transformer model. Each of these new approaches consists of a fundamental architecture accompanied by a set of modeling and training techniques that are in principle applicable to other seq2seq architectures. In this paper we tease apart the new architectures and their accompanying techniques in two ways. First we identify several key modeling and training techniques and apply them to the RNN architecture yielding a new RNMT+ model that outperforms all of the three fundamental architectures on the benchmark WMT14 English to French and English to German tasks. Second we analyze the properties of each fundamental seq2seq architecture and devise new hybrid architectures intended to combine their strengths. Our hybrid models obtain further improvements outperforming the RNMT+ model on both benchmark datasets.

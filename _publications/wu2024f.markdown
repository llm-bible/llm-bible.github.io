Endowing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with visual grounding capability can significantly enhance AIs understanding of the visual world and their interaction with humans. However existing methods typically fine-tune the parameters of LMMs to learn additional segmentation tokens and overfit grounding and segmentation datasets. Such a design would inevitably cause a catastrophic diminution in the indispensable conversational capability of general AI assistants. In this paper we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks observing pronounced performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue we present F-LMM -- grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations -- a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention weights of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs original conversational ability. Additionally with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained our F-LMM can perform visual chain-of-thought reasoning and better resist object hallucinations.

The concept of persona originally adopted in dialogue literature has re-surged as a promising framework for tailoring large language models (LLMs) to specific context (e.g. personalized search LLM-as-a-judge). However the growing research on leveraging persona in LLMs is relatively disorganized and lacks a systematic taxonomy. To close the gap we present a comprehensive survey to categorize the current state of the field. We identify two lines of research namely (1) LLM Role-Playing where personas are assigned to LLMs and (2) LLM Personalization where LLMs take care of user personas. Additionally we introduce existing methods for LLM personality evaluation. To the best of our knowledge we present the first survey for role-playing and personalization in LLMs under the unified view of persona. We continuously maintain a paper collection to foster future endeavors https://github.com/MiuLab/PersonaLLM-Survey

Financial sectors are rapidly adopting language model technologies, yet
evaluating specialized RAG systems in this domain remains challenging. This
paper introduces SMARTFinRAG, addressing three critical gaps in financial RAG
assessment: (1) a fully modular architecture where components can be
dynamically interchanged during runtime; (2) a document-centric evaluation
paradigm generating domain-specific QA pairs from newly ingested financial
documents; and (3) an intuitive interface bridging research-implementation
divides. Our evaluation quantifies both retrieval efficacy and response
quality, revealing significant performance variations across configurations.
The platform's open-source architecture supports transparent, reproducible
research while addressing practical deployment challenges faced by financial
institutions implementing RAG systems.

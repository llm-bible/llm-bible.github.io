In this paper we present CORE45;GPT a novel question45;answering platform that combines GPT45;based language models and more than 32 million full45;text open access scientific articles from CORE. We first demonstrate that GPT3.5 and GPT4 cannot be relied upon to provide references or citations for generated text. We then introduce CORE45;GPT which delivers evidence45;based answers to questions along with citations and links to the cited papers greatly increasing the trustworthiness of the answers and reducing the risk of hallucinations. CORE45;GPTs performance was evaluated on a dataset of 100 questions covering the top 20 scientific domains in CORE resulting in 100 answers and links to 500 relevant articles. The quality of the provided answers and and relevance of the links were assessed by two annotators. Our results demonstrate that CORE45;GPT can produce comprehensive and trustworthy answers across the majority of scientific domains complete with links to genuine relevant scientific articles.

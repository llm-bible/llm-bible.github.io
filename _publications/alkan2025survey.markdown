Hypothesis generation is a fundamental step in scientific discovery, yet it
is increasingly challenged by information overload and disciplinary
fragmentation. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked
growing interest in their potential to enhance and automate this process. This
paper presents a comprehensive survey of hypothesis generation with LLMs by (i)
reviewing existing methods, from simple prompting techniques to more complex
frameworks, and proposing a taxonomy that categorizes these approaches; (ii)
analyzing techniques for improving hypothesis quality, such as novelty boosting
and structured reasoning; (iii) providing an overview of evaluation strategies;
and (iv) discussing key challenges and future directions, including multimodal
integration and human-AI collaboration. Our survey aims to serve as a reference
for researchers exploring LLMs for hypothesis generation.

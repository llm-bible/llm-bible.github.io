RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as well as strict instructions to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors responses. By using RAGMans AI tutors students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions. RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors the students feedback and a comparative grade analysis. Overall about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 9837; of the time. Within the students used AI tutors 7837; reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors ability to provide valuable suggestions students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment.

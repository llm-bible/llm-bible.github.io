Recent advances in interactive large language models like ChatGPT have revolutionized various domains; however their behavior in natural and role45;play conversation settings remains underexplored. In our study we address this gap by deeply investigating how ChatGPT behaves during conversations in different settings by analyzing its interactions in both a normal way and a role45;play setting. We introduce a novel dataset of broad range of human45;AI conversations annotated with user motives and model naturalness to examine (i) how humans engage with the conversational AI model and (ii) how natural are AI model responses. Our study highlights the diversity of user motives when interacting with ChatGPT and variable AI naturalness showing not only the nuanced dynamics of natural conversations between humans and AI but also providing new avenues for improving the effectiveness of human45;AI communication.

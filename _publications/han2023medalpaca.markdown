As large language models (LLMs) like OpenAIs GPT series continue to make strides we witness the emergence of artificial intelligence applications in an ever45;expanding range of fields. In medicine these LLMs hold considerable promise for improving medical workflows diagnostics patient care and education. Yet there is an urgent need for open45;source models that can be deployed on45;premises to safeguard patient privacy. In our work we present an innovative dataset consisting of over 160000 entries specifically crafted to fine45;tune LLMs for effective medical applications. We investigate the impact of fine45;tuning these datasets on publicly accessible pre45;trained LLMs and subsequently we juxtapose the performance of pre45;trained45;only models against the fine45;tuned models concerning the examinations that future medical doctors must pass to achieve certification.

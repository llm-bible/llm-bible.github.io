The demand for accurate and efficient verification of information in texts generated by large language models (LMs) is at an all45;time high but remains unresolved. Recent efforts have focused on extracting and verifying atomic facts from these texts via prompting LM evaluators. However we demonstrate that this method of prompting is unreliable when faced with incomplete or inaccurate reference information. We introduce Facts as a Function (FaaF) a new approach to the fact verification task that leverages the function45;calling capabilities of LMs. FaaF significantly enhances the ability of LMs to identify unsupported facts in texts while also improving efficiency and significantly lowering costs compared to prompt45;based methods. Additionally we propose a framework for evaluating factual recall in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems which we employ to compare prompt45;based and FaaF methods using various LMs under challenging conditions.

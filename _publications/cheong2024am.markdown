Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of providing users with advice in a wide range of professional domains including legal advice. However relying on LLMs for legal queries raises concerns due to the significant expertise required and the potential real-world consequences of the advice. To explore textitwhen and textitwhy LLMs should or should not provide advice to users we conducted workshops with 20 legal experts using methods inspired by case-based reasoning. The provided realistic queries (cases) allowed experts to examine granular situation-specific concerns and overarching technical and legal constraints producing a concrete set of contextual considerations for LLM developers. By synthesizing the factors that impacted LLM response appropriateness we present a 4-dimension framework (1) User attributes and behaviors (2) Nature of queries (3) AI capabilities and (4) Social impacts. We share experts recommendations for LLM response strategies which center around helping users identify right questions to ask and relevant information rather than providing definitive legal judgments. Our findings reveal novel legal considerations such as unauthorized practice of law confidentiality and liability for inaccurate advice that have been overlooked in the literature. The case-based deliberation method enabled us to elicit fine-grained practice-informed insights that surpass those from de-contextualized surveys or speculative principles. These findings underscore the applicability of our method for translating domain-specific professional knowledge and practices into policies that can guide LLM behavior in a more responsible direction.

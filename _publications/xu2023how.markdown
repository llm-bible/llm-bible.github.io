Scaling language models have revolutionized widespread NLP tasks, yet little
comprehensively explored few-shot relation extraction with large language
models. In this paper, we investigate principal methodologies, in-context
learning and data generation, for few-shot relation extraction via GPT-3.5
through exhaustive experiments. To enhance few-shot performance, we further
propose task-related instructions and schema-constrained data generation. We
observe that in-context learning can achieve performance on par with previous
prompt learning approaches, and data generation with the large language model
can boost previous solutions to obtain new state-of-the-art few-shot results on
four widely-studied relation extraction datasets. We hope our work can inspire
future research for the capabilities of large language models in few-shot
relation extraction. Code is available in

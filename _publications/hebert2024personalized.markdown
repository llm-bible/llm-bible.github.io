Understanding the nuances of a users extensive interaction history is key to building accurate and personalized natural language systems that can adapt to evolving user preferences. To address this we introduce PERSOMA Personalized Soft Prompt Adapter architecture. Unlike previous personalized prompting methods for large language models PERSOMA offers a novel approach to efficiently capture user history. It achieves this by resampling and compressing interactions as free form text into expressive soft prompt embeddings building upon recent research utilizing embedding representations as input for LLMs. We rigorously validate our approach by evaluating various adapter architectures first45;stage sampling strategies parameter45;efficient tuning techniques like LoRA and other personalization methods. Our results demonstrate PERSOMAs superior ability to handle large and complex user histories compared to existing embedding45;based and text45;prompt45;based techniques.

The Large Language Model Bias Index (LLMBI) is a pioneering approach designed to quantify and address biases inherent in large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. We recognise the increasing prevalence and impact of LLMs across diverse sectors. This research introduces a novel metric LLMBI to systematically measure and mitigate biases potentially skewing model responses. We formulated LLMBI using a composite scoring system incorporating multiple dimensions of bias including but not limited to age gender and racial biases. To operationalise this metric we engaged in a multi-step process involving collecting and annotating LLM responses applying sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for bias detection and computing the LLMBI score through a specially crafted mathematical formula. The formula integrates weighted averages of various bias dimensions a penalty for dataset diversity deficiencies and a correction for sentiment biases. Our empirical analysis conducted using responses from OpenAIs API employs advanced sentiment analysis as a representative method for bias detection. The research reveals LLMs whilst demonstrating impressive capabilities in text generation exhibit varying degrees of bias across different dimensions. LLMBI provides a quantifiable measure to compare biases across models and over time offering a vital tool for systems engineers researchers and regulators in enhancing the fairness and reliability of LLMs. It highlights the potential of LLMs in mimicking unbiased human-like responses. Additionally it underscores the necessity of continuously monitoring and recalibrating such models to align with evolving societal norms and ethical standards.

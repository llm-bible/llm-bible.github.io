Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) engage users in multi-turn
interactions to deliver personalized recommendations. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) further enhances these systems by enabling more natural
and dynamic user interactions. However, a key challenge remains in
understanding how personality traits shape conversational recommendation
outcomes. Psychological evidence highlights the influence of personality traits
on user interaction behaviors. To address this, we introduce an LLM-based
personality-aware user simulation for CRSs (PerCRS). The user agent induces
customizable personality traits and preferences, while the system agent
possesses the persuasion capability to simulate realistic interaction in CRSs.
We incorporate multi-aspect evaluation to ensure robustness and conduct
extensive analysis from both user and system perspectives. Experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art LLMs can effectively generate diverse user
responses aligned with specified personality traits, thereby prompting CRSs to
dynamically adjust their recommendation strategies. Our experimental analysis
offers empirical insights into the impact of personality traits on the outcomes
of conversational recommender systems.

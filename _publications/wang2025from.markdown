The rapid pace of large-scale software development places increasing demands
on traditional testing methodologies, often leading to bottlenecks in
efficiency, accuracy, and coverage. We propose a novel perspective on software
testing by positing bug detection and coding with fewer bugs as two
interconnected problems that share a common goal, which is reducing bugs with
limited resources. We extend our previous work on AI-assisted programming,
which supports code auto-completion and chatbot-powered Q&A, to the realm of
software testing. We introduce Copilot for Testing, an automated testing system
that synchronizes bug detection with codebase updates, leveraging context-based
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). Our evaluation demonstrates a 31.2% improvement in bug
detection accuracy, a 12.6% increase in critical test coverage, and a 10.5%
higher user acceptance rate, highlighting the transformative potential of
AI-driven technologies in modern software development practices.

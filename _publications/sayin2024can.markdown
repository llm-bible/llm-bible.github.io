We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist and potentially correct physicians in medical decision-making tasks. We evaluate several LLMs including Meditron Llama2 and Mistral to analyze the ability of these models to interact effectively with physicians across different scenarios. We consider questions from PubMedQA and several tasks ranging from binary (yes/no) responses to long answer generation where the answer of the model is produced after an interaction with a physician. Our findings suggest that prompt design significantly influences the downstream accuracy of LLMs and that LLMs can provide valuable feedback to physicians challenging incorrect diagnoses and contributing to more accurate decision-making. For example when the physician is accurate 38 of the time Mistral can produce the correct answer improving accuracy up to 74 depending on the prompt being used while Llama2 and Meditron models exhibit greater sensitivity to prompt choice. Our analysis also uncovers the challenges of ensuring that LLM-generated suggestions are pertinent and useful emphasizing the need for further research in this area.

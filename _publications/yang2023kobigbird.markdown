This work presents KoBigBird45;large a large size of Korean BigBird that achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance and allows long sequence processing for Korean language understanding. Without further pretraining we only transform the architecture and extend the positional encoding with our proposed Tapered Absolute Positional Encoding Representations (TAPER). In experiments KoBigBird45;large shows state45;of45;the45;art overall performance on Korean language understanding benchmarks and the best performance on document classification and question answering tasks for longer sequences against the competitive baseline models. We publicly release our model here.

The rise of LLMs has deflected a growing portion of human-computer
interactions towards LLM-based chatbots. The remarkable abilities of these
models allow users to interact using long, diverse natural language text
covering a wide range of topics and styles. Phrasing these messages is a time
and effort consuming task, calling for an autocomplete solution to assist
users. We introduce the task of chatbot interaction autocomplete. We present
ChaI-TeA: CHat InTEraction Autocomplete; An autcomplete evaluation framework
for LLM-based chatbot interactions. The framework includes a formal definition
of the task, coupled with suitable datasets and metrics. We use the framework
to evaluate After formally defining the task along with suitable datasets and
metrics, we test 9 models on the defined auto completion task, finding that
while current off-the-shelf models perform fairly, there is still much room for
improvement, mainly in ranking of the generated suggestions. We provide
insights for practitioners working on this task and open new research
directions for researchers in the field. We release our framework to serve as a
foundation for future research.

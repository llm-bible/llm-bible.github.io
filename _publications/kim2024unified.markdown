This paper introduces Evalverse a novel library that streamlines the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) by unifying disparate evaluation tools into a single user-friendly framework. Evalverse enables individuals with limited knowledge of artificial intelligence to easily request LLM evaluations and receive detailed reports facilitated by an integration with communication platforms like Slack. Thus Evalverse serves as a powerful tool for the comprehensive assessment of LLMs offering both researchers and practitioners a centralized and easily accessible evaluation framework. Finally we also provide a demo video for Evalverse showcasing its capabilities and implementation in a two-minute format.

Developing high45;performing dialogue systems benefits from the automatic identification of undesirable behaviors in system responses. However detecting such behaviors remains challenging as it draws on a breadth of general knowledge and understanding of conversational practices. Although recent research has focused on building specialized classifiers for detecting specific dialogue behaviors the behavior coverage is still incomplete and there is a lack of testing on real45;world human45;bot interactions. This paper investigates the ability of a state45;of45;the45;art large language model (LLM) ChatGPT45;3.5 to perform dialogue behavior detection for nine categories in real human45;bot dialogues. We aim to assess whether ChatGPT can match specialized models and approximate human performance thereby reducing the cost of behavior detection tasks. Our findings reveal that neither specialized models nor ChatGPT have yet achieved satisfactory results for this task falling short of human performance. Nevertheless ChatGPT shows promising potential and often outperforms specialized detection models. We conclude with an in45;depth examination of the prevalent shortcomings of ChatGPT offering guidance for future research to enhance LLM capabilities.

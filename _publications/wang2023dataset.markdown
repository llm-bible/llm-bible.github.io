We introduce NoteChat a novel cooperative multi45;agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate patient45;physician dialogues. NoteChat embodies the principle that an ensemble of role45;specific LLMs through structured role45;play and strategic prompting can perform their assigned roles more effectively. The synergy among these role45;playing LLMs results in a cohesive and efficient dialogue generation. Evaluation on MTS45;dialogue a benchmark dataset for patient45;physician dialogues45;note pairs shows that models trained with the augmented synthetic patient45;physician dialogues by NoteChat outperforms other state45;of45;the45;art models for generating clinical notes. Our comprehensive automatic and human evaluation demonstrates that NoteChat substantially surpasses state45;of45;the45;art models like ChatGPT and GPT45;4 up to 22.7837; by domain experts in generating superior synthetic patient45;physician dialogues based on clinical notes. NoteChat has the potential to engage patients directly and help clinical documentation a leading cause of physician burnout.

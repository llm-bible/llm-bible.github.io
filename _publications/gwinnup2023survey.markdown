Large language models such as BERT and the GPT series started a paradigm shift that calls for building general-purpose models via pre-training on large datasets followed by fine-tuning on task-specific datasets. There is now a plethora of large pre-trained models for Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. Recently we have seen rapid developments in the joint Vision-Language space as well where pre-trained models such as CLIP (Radford et al. 2021) have demonstrated improvements in downstream tasks like image captioning and visual question answering. However surprisingly there is comparatively little work on exploring these models for the task of multimodal machine translation where the goal is to leverage image/video modality in text-to-text translation. To fill this gap this paper surveys the landscape of language-and-vision pre-training from the lens of multimodal machine translation. We summarize the common architectures pre-training objectives and datasets from literature and conjecture what further is needed to make progress on multimodal machine translation.

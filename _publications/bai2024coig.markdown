Recently there have been significant advancements in large language models (LLMs) particularly focused on the English language. These advancements have enabled these LLMs to understand and execute complex instructions with unprecedented accuracy and fluency. However despite these advancements there remains a noticeable gap in the development of Chinese instruction tuning. The unique linguistic features and cultural depth of the Chinese language pose challenges for instruction tuning tasks. Existing datasets are either derived from English45;centric LLMs or are ill45;suited for aligning with the interaction patterns of real45;world Chinese users. To bridge this gap we introduce COIG45;CQIA a high45;quality Chinese instruction tuning dataset. Our aim is to build a diverse wide45;ranging instruction45;tuning dataset to better align model behavior with human interactions. To this end we collect a high45;quality human45;written corpus from various sources on the Chinese Internet including Qamp;A communities Wikis examinations and existing NLP datasets. This corpus was rigorously filtered and carefully processed to form the COIG45;CQIA dataset. Furthermore we train models of various scales on different subsets of CQIA following in45;depth evaluation and analyses. The findings from our experiments offer valuable insights for selecting and developing Chinese instruction45;tuning datasets. We also find that models trained on CQIA45;Subset achieve competitive results in human assessment as well as knowledge and security benchmarks.

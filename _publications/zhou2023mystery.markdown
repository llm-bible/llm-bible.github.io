Understanding in45;context learning (ICL) capability that enables large language models (LLMs) to excel in proficiency through demonstration examples is of utmost importance. This importance stems not only from the better utilization of this capability across various tasks but also from the proactive identification and mitigation of potential risks including concerns regarding truthfulness bias and toxicity that may arise alongside the capability. In this paper we present a thorough survey on the interpretation and analysis of in45;context learning. First we provide a concise introduction to the background and definition of in45;context learning. Then we give an overview of advancements from two perspectives 1) a theoretical perspective emphasizing studies on mechanistic interpretability and delving into the mathematical foundations behind ICL; and 2) an empirical perspective concerning studies that empirically analyze factors associated with ICL. We conclude by highlighting the challenges encountered and suggesting potential avenues for future research. We believe that our work establishes the basis for further exploration into the interpretation of in45;context learning. Additionally we have created a repository containing the resources referenced in our survey.

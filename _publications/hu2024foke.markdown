Integrating large language models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs (KGs) holds great promise for revolutionizing intelligent education but challenges remain in achieving personalization interactivity and explainability. We propose FOKE a Forest Of Knowledge and Education framework that synergizes foundation models knowledge graphs and prompt engineering to address these challenges. FOKE introduces three key innovations (1) a hierarchical knowledge forest for structured domain knowledge representation; (2) a multi-dimensional user profiling mechanism for comprehensive learner modeling; and (3) an interactive prompt engineering scheme for generating precise and tailored learning guidance. We showcase FOKEs application in programming education homework assessment and learning path planning demonstrating its effectiveness and practicality. Additionally we implement Scholar Hero a real-world instantiation of FOKE. Our research highlights the potential of integrating foundation models knowledge graphs and prompt engineering to revolutionize intelligent education practices ultimately benefiting learners worldwide. FOKE provides a principled and unified approach to harnessing cutting-edge AI technologies for personalized interactive and explainable educational services paving the way for further research and development in this critical direction.

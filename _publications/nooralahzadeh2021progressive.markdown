Inspired by Curriculum Learning we propose a consecutive (i.e. image45;to45;text45;to45;text) generation framework where we divide the problem of radiology report generation into two steps. Contrary to generating the full radiology report from the image at once the model generates global concepts from the image in the first step and then reforms them into finer and coherent texts using a transformer architecture. We follow the transformer45;based sequence45;to45;sequence paradigm at each step. We improve upon the state45;of45;the45;art on two benchmark datasets.

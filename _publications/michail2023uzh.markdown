This paper describes the submission of UZH95;CLyp for the SemEval 2023 Task 9 Multilingual Tweet Intimacy Analysis. We achieved second45;best results in all 10 languages according to the official Pearsons correlation regression evaluation measure. Our cross45;lingual transfer learning approach explores the benefits of using a Head45;First Fine45;Tuning method (HeFiT) that first updates only the regression head parameters and then also updates the pre45;trained transformer encoder parameters at a reduced learning rate. Additionally we study the impact of using a small set of automatically generated examples (in our case from ChatGPT) for low45;resource settings where no human45;labeled data is available. Our study shows that HeFiT stabilizes training and consistently improves results for pre45;trained models that lack domain adaptation to tweets. Our study also shows a noticeable performance increase in cross45;lingual learning when synthetic data is used confirming the usefulness of current text generation systems to improve zero45;shot baseline results. Finally we examine how possible inconsistencies in the annotated data contribute to cross45;lingual interference issues.

As an important component of data exploration and integration, Column Type
Annotation (CTA) aims to label columns of a table with one or more semantic
types. With the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers
have started to explore the possibility of using LLMs for CTA, leveraging their
strong zero-shot capabilities. In this paper, we build on this promising work
and improve on LLM-based methods for CTA by showing how to use a Knowledge
Graph (KG) to augment the context information provided to the LLM. Our
approach, called RACOON, combines both pre-trained parametric and
non-parametric knowledge during generation to improve LLMs' performance on CTA.
Our experiments show that RACOON achieves up to a 0.21 micro F-1 improvement
compared against vanilla LLM inference.

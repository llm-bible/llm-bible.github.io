Regulatory texts are inherently long and complex, presenting significant
challenges for information retrieval systems in supporting regulatory officers
with compliance tasks. This paper introduces a hybrid information retrieval
system that combines lexical and semantic search techniques to extract relevant
information from large regulatory corpora. The system integrates a fine-tuned
sentence transformer model with the traditional BM25 algorithm to achieve both
semantic precision and lexical coverage. To generate accurate and comprehensive
responses, retrieved passages are synthesized using Large Language Models
(LLMs) within a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. Experimental
results demonstrate that the hybrid system significantly outperforms standalone
lexical and semantic approaches, with notable improvements in Recall@10 and
MAP@10. By openly sharing our fine-tuned model and methodology, we aim to
advance the development of robust natural language processing tools for
compliance-driven applications in regulatory domains.

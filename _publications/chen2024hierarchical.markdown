Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has rapidly advanced the language model
field, particularly in question-answering (QA) systems. By integrating external
documents during the response generation phase, RAG significantly enhances the
accuracy and reliability of language models. This method elevates the quality
of responses and reduces the frequency of hallucinations, where the model
generates incorrect or misleading information. However, these methods exhibit
limited retrieval accuracy when faced with numerous indistinguishable
documents, presenting notable challenges in their practical application. In
response to these emerging challenges, we present HiQA, an advanced
multi-document question-answering (MDQA) framework that integrates cascading
metadata into content and a multi-route retrieval mechanism. We also release a
benchmark called MasQA to evaluate and research in MDQA. Finally, HiQA
demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance in multi-document environments.

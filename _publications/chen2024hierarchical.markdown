As language model agents leveraging external tools rapidly evolve significant progress has been made in question45;answering(QA) methodologies utilizing supplementary documents and the Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. This advancement has improved the response quality of language models and alleviates the appearance of hallucination. However these methods exhibit limited retrieval accuracy when faced with massive indistinguishable documents presenting notable challenges in their practical application. In response to these emerging challenges we present HiQA an advanced framework for multi45;document question45;answering (MDQA) that integrates cascading metadata into content as well as a multi45;route retrieval mechanism. We also release a benchmark called MasQA to evaluate and research in MDQA. Finally HiQA demonstrates the state45;of45;the45;art performance in multi45;document environments.

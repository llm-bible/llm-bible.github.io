Language models pre45;trained on general text have achieved impressive results in diverse fields. Yet the distinct linguistic characteristics of task45;oriented dialogues (TOD) compared to general text limit the practical utility of existing language models. Current task45;oriented dialogue pre45;training methods overlook the one45;to45;many property of conversations where multiple responses can be appropriate given the same conversation context. In this paper we propose a novel dialogue pre45;training model called DivTOD which collaborates with LLMs to learn diverse task45;oriented dialogue representations. DivTOD guides LLMs in transferring diverse knowledge to smaller models while removing domain knowledge that contradicts task45;oriented dialogues. Experiments show that our model outperforms strong TOD baselines on various downstream dialogue tasks and learns the intrinsic diversity of task45;oriented dialogues.

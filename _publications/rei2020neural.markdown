We present COMET, a neural framework for training multilingual machine
translation evaluation models which obtains new state-of-the-art levels of
correlation with human judgements. Our framework leverages recent breakthroughs
in cross-lingual pretrained language modeling resulting in highly multilingual
and adaptable MT evaluation models that exploit information from both the
source input and a target-language reference translation in order to more
accurately predict MT quality. To showcase our framework, we train three models
with different types of human judgements: Direct Assessments, Human-mediated
Translation Edit Rate and Multidimensional Quality Metrics. Our models achieve
new state-of-the-art performance on the WMT 2019 Metrics shared task and
demonstrate robustness to high-performing systems.

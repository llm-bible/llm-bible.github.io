Open45;domain dialogue systems have seen remarkable advancements with the development of large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless most existing dialogue systems predominantly focus on brief single45;session interactions neglecting the real45;world demands for long45;term companionship and personalized interactions with chatbots. Crucial to addressing this real45;world need are event summary and persona management which enable reasoning for appropriate long45;term dialogue responses. Recent progress in the human45;like cognitive and reasoning capabilities of LLMs suggests that LLM45;based agents could significantly enhance automated perception decision45;making and problem45;solving. In response to this potential we introduce a model45;agnostic framework the Long45;term Dialogue Agent (LD45;Agent) which incorporates three independently tunable modules dedicated to event perception persona extraction and response generation. For the event memory module long and short45;term memory banks are employed to separately focus on historical and ongoing sessions while a topic45;based retrieval mechanism is introduced to enhance the accuracy of memory retrieval. Furthermore the persona module conducts dynamic persona modeling for both users and agents. The integration of retrieved memories and extracted personas is subsequently fed into the generator to induce appropriate responses. The effectiveness generality and cross45;domain capabilities of LD45;Agent are empirically demonstrated across various illustrative benchmarks models and tasks. The code is released at https://github.com/leolee99/LD&#45;Agent.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) perform (and sometimes excel at) more and
more complex cognitive tasks, a natural question is whether AI really
understands. The study of understanding in LLMs is in its infancy, and the
community has yet to incorporate well-trodden research in philosophy,
psychology, and education. We initiate this, specifically focusing on
understanding algorithms, and propose a hierarchy of levels of understanding.
We use the hierarchy to design and conduct a study with human subjects
(undergraduate and graduate students) as well as large language models
(generations of GPT), revealing interesting similarities and differences. We
expect that our rigorous criteria will be useful to keep track of AI's progress
in such cognitive domains.

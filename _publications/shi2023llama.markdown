E-commerce authoring entails creating engaging, diverse, and targeted content
to enhance preference elicitation and retrieval experience. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized content generation, they often fall
short in e-commerce applications due to their limited memorization of
domain-specific features. This paper proposes LLaMA-E, the unified e-commerce
authoring models that address the contextual preferences of customers, sellers,
and platforms, the essential objects in e-commerce operation. We design the
instruction set derived from tasks of ads generation, query-enhanced product
title rewriting, product classification, purchase intent speculation, and
general e-commerce Q&A. The instruction formulation ensures the interleaved
cover of the presented and required object features, allowing the alignment of
base models to parameterise e-commerce knowledge comprehensively. The proposed
LLaMA-E models achieve state-of-the-art evaluation performance and exhibit the
advantage in zero-shot practical applications. To our knowledge, this is the
first LLM tailored to empower authoring applications with comprehensive
scenario understanding by integrating features focused on participated objects.

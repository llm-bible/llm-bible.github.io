The evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) models has gained increased attention urging the development of metrics that evaluate various aspects of generated text. LUNA addresses this challenge by introducing a unified interface for 20 NLG evaluation metrics. These metrics are categorized based on their reference45;dependence and the type of text representation they employ from string45;based n45;gram overlap to the utilization of static embeddings and pre45;trained language models. The straightforward design of LUNA allows for easy extension with novel metrics requiring just a few lines of code. LUNA offers a user45;friendly tool for evaluating generated texts.

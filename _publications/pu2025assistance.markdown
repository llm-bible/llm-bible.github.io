AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes
attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on
programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate
Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance
based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface
variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support:
prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context
(Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive
agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur
workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context
support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes.
We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code
understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming
processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of
proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated
programming workflow.

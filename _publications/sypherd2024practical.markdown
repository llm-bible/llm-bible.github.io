As the strength of Large Language Models (LLMs) has grown over recent years,
so too has interest in their use as the underlying models for autonomous
agents. Although LLMs demonstrate emergent abilities and broad expertise across
natural language domains, their inherent unpredictability makes the
implementation of LLM agents challenging, resulting in a gap between related
research and the real-world implementation of such systems. To bridge this gap,
this paper frames actionable insights and considerations from the research
community in the context of established application paradigms to enable the
construction and facilitate the informed deployment of robust LLM agents.
Namely, we position relevant research findings into four broad
categories--Planning, Memory, Tools, and Control Flow--based on common
practices in application-focused literature and highlight practical
considerations to make when designing agentic LLMs for real-world applications,
such as handling stochasticity and managing resources efficiently. While we do
not conduct empirical evaluations, we do provide the necessary background for
discussing critical aspects of agentic LLM designs, both in academia and
industry.

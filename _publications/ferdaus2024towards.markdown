The rapid progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) could transform many fields but their fast development creates significant challenges for oversight ethical creation and building user trust. This comprehensive review looks at key trust issues in LLMs such as unintended harms lack of transparency vulnerability to attacks alignment with human values and environmental impact. Many obstacles can undermine user trust including societal biases opaque decision-making potential for misuse and the challenges of rapidly evolving technology. Addressing these trust gaps is critical as LLMs become more common in sensitive areas like finance healthcare education and policy. To tackle these issues we suggest combining ethical oversight industry accountability regulation and public involvement. AI development norms should be reshaped incentives aligned and ethics integrated throughout the machine learning process which requires close collaboration across technology ethics law policy and other fields. Our review contributes a robust framework to assess trust in LLMs and analyzes the complex trust dynamics in depth. We provide contextualized guidelines and standards for responsibly developing and deploying these powerful AI systems. This review identifies key limitations and challenges in creating trustworthy AI. By addressing these issues we aim to build a transparent accountable AI ecosystem that benefits society while minimizing risks. Our findings provide valuable guidance for researchers policymakers and industry leaders striving to establish trust in LLMs and ensure they are used responsibly across various applications for the good of society.

Spoken language understanding (SLU) systems in conversational AI agents often experience errors in the form of misrecognitions by automatic speech recognition (ASR) or semantic gaps in natural language understanding (NLU). These errors easily translate to user frustrations particularly so in recurrent events e.g. regularly toggling an appliance calling a frequent contact etc. In this work we propose a query rewriting approach by leveraging users historically successful interactions as a form of memory. We present a neural retrieval model and a pointer-generator network with hierarchical attention and show that they perform significantly better at the query rewriting task with the aforementioned user memories than without. We also highlight how our approach with the proposed models leverages the structural and semantic diversity in ASRs output towards recovering users intents.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) generated by large language models (LLMs) are becoming
increasingly valuable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications
that require knowledge-intensive reasoning. However, existing KG extraction
methods predominantly rely on prompt-based approaches, which are inefficient
for processing large-scale corpora. These approaches often suffer from
information loss, particularly with long documents, due to the lack of
specialized design for KG construction. Additionally, there is a gap in
evaluation datasets and methodologies for ontology-free KG construction. To
overcome these limitations, we propose SynthKG, a multi-step, document-level
ontology-free KG synthesis workflow based on LLMs. By fine-tuning a smaller LLM
on the synthesized document-KG pairs, we streamline the multi-step process into
a single-step KG generation approach called Distill-SynthKG, substantially
reducing the number of LLM inference calls. Furthermore, we re-purpose existing
question-answering datasets to establish KG evaluation datasets and introduce
new evaluation metrics. Using KGs produced by Distill-SynthKG, we also design a
novel graph-based retrieval framework for RAG. Experimental results demonstrate
that Distill-SynthKG not only surpasses all baseline models in KG quality --
including models up to eight times larger -- but also consistently excels in
retrieval and question-answering tasks. Our proposed graph retrieval framework
also outperforms all KG-retrieval methods across multiple benchmark datasets.
We release the SynthKG dataset and Distill-SynthKG model publicly to support
further research and development.

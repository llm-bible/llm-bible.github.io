Literature research, vital for scientific advancement, is overwhelmed by the
vast ocean of available information. Addressing this, we propose an automated
review generation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline
literature processing and reduce cognitive load. In case study on propane
dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly generated comprehensive
reviews from 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account.
Extended analysis of 1041 articles provided deep insights into catalysts'
composition, structure, and performance. Recognizing LLMs' hallucinations, we
employed a multi-layered quality control strategy, ensuring our method's
reliability and effective hallucination mitigation. Expert verification
confirms the accuracy and citation integrity of generated reviews,
demonstrating LLM hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5% with over 95%
confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation,
aiding researchers in tracking advancements and recommending literature. This
approach showcases LLMs' role in enhancing scientific research productivity and
sets the stage for further exploration.

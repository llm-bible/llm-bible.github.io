Neural network45;based sequence45;to45;sequence (seq2seq) models strongly suffer from the low45;diversity problem when it comes to open45;domain dialogue generation. As bland and generic utterances usually dominate the frequency distribution in our daily chitchat avoiding them to generate more interesting responses requires complex data filtering sampling techniques or modifying the training objective. In this paper we propose a new perspective to diversify dialogue generation by leveraging non45;conversational text. Compared with bilateral conversations non45;conversational text are easier to obtain more diverse and cover a much broader range of topics. We collect a large45;scale non45;conversational corpus from multi sources including forum comments idioms and book snippets. We further present a training paradigm to effectively incorporate these text via iterative back translation. The resulting model is tested on two conversational datasets and is shown to produce significantly more diverse responses without sacrificing the relevance with context.

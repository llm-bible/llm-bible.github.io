In this paper, we present strong baselines for the task of Feedback Comment
Generation for Writing Learning. Given a sentence and an error span, the task
is to generate a feedback comment explaining the error. Sentences and feedback
comments are both in English. We experiment with LLMs and also create multiple
pseudo datasets for the task, investigating how it affects the performance of
our system. We present our results for the task along with extensive analysis
of the generated comments with the aim of aiding future studies in feedback
comment generation for English language learners.

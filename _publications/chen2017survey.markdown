Dialogue systems have attracted more and more attention. Recent advances on
dialogue systems are overwhelmingly contributed by deep learning techniques,
which have been employed to enhance a wide range of big data applications such
as computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. For
dialogue systems, deep learning can leverage a massive amount of data to learn
meaningful feature representations and response generation strategies, while
requiring a minimum amount of hand-crafting. In this article, we give an
overview to these recent advances on dialogue systems from various perspectives
and discuss some possible research directions. In particular, we generally
divide existing dialogue systems into task-oriented and non-task-oriented
models, then detail how deep learning techniques help them with representative
algorithms and finally discuss some appealing research directions that can
bring the dialogue system research into a new frontier.

This study presents a method for implementing generative AI services by
utilizing the Large Language Models (LLM) application architecture. With recent
advancements in generative AI technology, LLMs have gained prominence across
various domains. In this context, the research addresses the challenge of
information scarcity and proposes specific remedies by harnessing LLM
capabilities. The investigation delves into strategies for mitigating the issue
of inadequate data, offering tailored solutions. The study delves into the
efficacy of employing fine-tuning techniques and direct document integration to
alleviate data insufficiency. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model, which tackles the
aforementioned challenges. The RAG model is carefully designed to enhance
information storage and retrieval processes, ensuring improved content
generation. The research elucidates the key phases of the information storage
and retrieval methodology underpinned by the RAG model. A comprehensive
analysis of these steps is undertaken, emphasizing their significance in
addressing the scarcity of data. The study highlights the efficacy of the
proposed method, showcasing its applicability through illustrative instances.
By implementing the RAG model for information storage and retrieval, the
research not only contributes to a deeper comprehension of generative AI
technology but also facilitates its practical usability within enterprises
utilizing LLMs. This work holds substantial value in advancing the field of
generative AI, offering insights into enhancing data-driven content generation
and fostering active utilization of LLM-based services within corporate
settings.

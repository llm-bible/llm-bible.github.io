The remarkable multimodal capabilities demonstrated by OpenAI's GPT-4 have
sparked significant interest in the development of multimodal Large Language
Models (LLMs). A primary research objective of such models is to align visual
and textual modalities effectively while comprehending human instructions.
Current methodologies often rely on annotations derived from benchmark datasets
to construct image-dialogue datasets for training purposes, akin to instruction
tuning in LLMs. However, these datasets often exhibit domain bias, potentially
constraining the generative capabilities of the models. In an effort to
mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel data collection methodology that
synchronously synthesizes images and dialogues for visual instruction tuning.
This approach harnesses the power of generative models, marrying the abilities
of ChatGPT and text-to-image generative models to yield a diverse and
controllable dataset with varied image content. Additionally, datasets can be
arbitrarily scaled. This not only provides greater flexibility compared to
existing methodologies but also significantly enhances several model
capabilities. Our research includes comprehensive experiments conducted on
various datasets. The results emphasize substantial enhancements in more than
ten commonly assessed capabilities. Additionally, our model achieves
state-of-the-art results across multiple widely recognized multimodal
benchmarks.

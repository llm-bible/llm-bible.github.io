Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have significantly impacted the AI community industry and various economic sectors. In journalism integrating AI poses unique challenges and opportunities particularly in enhancing the quality and efficiency of news reporting. This study explores how LLMs and LMMs can assist journalistic practice by generating contextualised captions for images accompanying news articles. We conducted experiments using the GoodNews dataset to evaluate the ability of LMMs (BLIP45;2 GPT45;4v or LLaVA) to incorporate one of two types of context entire news articles or extracted named entities. In addition we compared their performance to a two45;stage pipeline composed of a captioning model (BLIP45;2 OFA or ViT45;GPT2) with post45;hoc contextualisation with LLMs (GPT45;4 or LLaMA). We assess a diversity of models and we find that while the choice of contextualisation model is a significant factor for the two45;stage pipelines this is not the case in the LMMs where smaller open45;source models perform well compared to proprietary GPT45;powered ones. Additionally we found that controlling the amount of provided context enhances performance. These results highlight the limitations of a fully automated approach and underscore the necessity for an interactive human45;in45;the45;loop strategy.

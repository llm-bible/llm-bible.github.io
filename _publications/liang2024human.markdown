Large Language Models (LLM) have shown encouraging progress in multimodal understanding and generation tasks. However how to design a human45;aligned and interpretable melody composition system is still under45;explored. To solve this problem we propose ByteComposer an agent framework emulating a humans creative pipeline in four separate steps Conception Analysis 45; Draft Composition 45; Self45;Evaluation and Modification 45; Aesthetic Selection. This framework seamlessly blends the interactive and knowledge45;understanding features of LLMs with existing symbolic music generation models thereby achieving a melody composition agent comparable to human creators. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT4 and several open45;source large language models which substantiate our frameworks effectiveness. Furthermore professional music composers were engaged in multi45;dimensional evaluations the final results demonstrated that across various facets of music composition ByteComposer agent attains the level of a novice melody composer.

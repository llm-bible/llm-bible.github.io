Generative AI tools such as chatGPT are poised to change the way people
engage with online information. Recently, Microsoft announced their "new Bing"
search system which incorporates chat and generative AI technology from OpenAI.
Google has announced plans to deploy search interfaces that incorporate similar
types of technology. These new technologies will transform how people can
search for information. The research presented here is an early investigation
into how people make use of a generative AI chat system (referred to simply as
chat from here on) as part of a search process, and how the incorporation of
chat systems with existing search tools may effect users search behaviors and
strategies.
  We report on an exploratory user study with 10 participants who used a
combined Chat+Search system that utilized the OpenAI GPT-3.5 API and the Bing
Web Search v5 API. Participants completed three search tasks. In this pre-print
paper of preliminary results, we report on ways that users integrated AI chat
into their search process, things they liked and disliked about the chat
system, their trust in the chat responses, and their mental models of how the
chat system generated responses.

Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise in
healthcare, demonstrating capabilities such as passing medical licensing exams
and providing clinical knowledge. However, their current use as information
retrieval tools is limited by challenges like data staleness, resource demands,
and occasional generation of incorrect information. This study assessed the
potential of LLMs to function as autonomous agents in a simulated tertiary care
medical center, using real-world clinical cases across multiple specialties.
Both proprietary and open-source LLMs were evaluated, with Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) enhancing contextual relevance. Proprietary models,
particularly GPT-4, generally outperformed open-source models, showing improved
guideline adherence and more accurate responses with RAG. The manual evaluation
by expert clinicians was crucial in validating models' outputs, underscoring
the importance of human oversight in LLM operation. Further, the study
emphasizes Natural Language Programming (NLP) as the appropriate paradigm for
modifying model behavior, allowing for precise adjustments through tailored
prompts and real-world interactions. This approach highlights the potential of
LLMs to significantly enhance and supplement clinical decision-making, while
also emphasizing the value of continuous expert involvement and the flexibility
of NLP to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in healthcare settings.

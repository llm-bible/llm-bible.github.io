We assessed the performance of commercial Large Language Models (LLMs) GPT45;3.545;Turbo and GPT45;4 on tasks from the 2023 BioASQ challenge. In Task 11b Phase B which is focused on answer generation both models demonstrated competitive abilities with leading systems. Remarkably they achieved this with simple zero45;shot learning grounded with relevant snippets. Even without relevant snippets their performance was decent though not on par with the best systems. Interestingly the older and cheaper GPT45;3.545;Turbo system was able to compete with GPT45;4 in the grounded Qamp;A setting on factoid and list answers. In Task 11b Phase A focusing on retrieval query expansion through zero45;shot learning improved performance but the models fell short compared to other systems. The code needed to rerun these experiments is available through GitHub.

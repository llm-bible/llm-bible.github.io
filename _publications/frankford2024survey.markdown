This paper analyzes Large Language Models (LLMs) with regard to their
programming exercise generation capabilities. Through a survey study, we
defined the state of the art, extracted their strengths and weaknesses and
finally proposed an evaluation matrix, helping researchers and educators to
decide which LLM is the best fitting for the programming exercise generation
use case. We also found that multiple LLMs are capable of producing useful
programming exercises. Nevertheless, there exist challenges like the ease with
which LLMs might solve exercises generated by LLMs. This paper contributes to
the ongoing discourse on the integration of LLMs in education.

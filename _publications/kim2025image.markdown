Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for
recommender systems. Existing LLM-based recommender systems take two different
approaches for representing items in natural language, i.e., Attribute-based
Representation and Description-based Representation. In this work, we aim to
address the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness that these two
approaches encounter, when representing items consumed by users. Based on our
interesting observation that there is a significant information overlap between
images and descriptions associated with items, we propose a novel method, Image
is all you need for LLM-based Recommender system (I-LLMRec). Our main idea is
to leverage images as an alternative to lengthy textual descriptions for
representing items, aiming at reducing token usage while preserving the rich
semantic information of item descriptions. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that I-LLMRec outperforms existing methods in both efficiency and
effectiveness by leveraging images. Moreover, a further appeal of I-LLMRec is
its ability to reduce sensitivity to noise in descriptions, leading to more
robust recommendations.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize the
analysis and synthesis of legal documents, enabling the automation of tasks
such as summarization, classification, and retrieval of legal information. This
study aims to conduct a systematic literature review to identify the state of
the art in prompt engineering applied to LLMs in the legal context. The results
indicate that models such as GPT-4, BERT, Llama 2, and Legal-Pegasus are widely
employed in the legal field, and techniques such as Few-shot Learning,
Zero-shot Learning, and Chain-of-Thought prompting have proven effective in
improving the interpretation of legal texts. However, challenges such as biases
in models and hallucinations still hinder their large-scale implementation. It
is concluded that, despite the great potential of LLMs for the legal field,
there is a need to improve prompt engineering strategies to ensure greater
accuracy and reliability in the generated results.

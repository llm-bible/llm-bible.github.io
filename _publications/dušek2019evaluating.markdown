This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the first shared task on End45;to45;End Natural Language Generation (NLG) and identifies avenues for future research based on the results. This shared task aimed to assess whether recent end45;to45;end NLG systems can generate more complex output by learning from datasets containing higher lexical richness syntactic complexity and diverse discourse phenomena. Introducing novel automatic and human metrics we compare 62 systems submitted by 17 institutions covering a wide range of approaches including machine learning architectures 45;45; with the majority implementing sequence45;to45;sequence models (seq2seq) 45;45; as well as systems based on grammatical rules and templates. Seq2seq45;based systems have demonstrated a great potential for NLG in the challenge. We find that seq2seq systems generally score high in terms of word45;overlap metrics and human evaluations of naturalness 45;45; with the winning SLUG system (Juraska et al. 2018) being seq2seq45;based. However vanilla seq2seq models often fail to correctly express a given meaning representation if they lack a strong semantic control mechanism applied during decoding. Moreover seq2seq models can be outperformed by hand45;engineered systems in terms of overall quality as well as complexity length and diversity of outputs. This research has influenced inspired and motivated a number of recent studies outwith the original competition which we also summarise as part of this paper.

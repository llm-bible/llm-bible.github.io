State-of-the-art performance in QA tasks is currently achieved by systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs) however these models tend to hallucinate information in their responses. One approach focuses on enhancing the generation process by incorporating attribution from the given input to the output. However the challenge of identifying appropriate attributions and verifying their accuracy against a source is a complex task that requires significant improvements in assessing such systems. We introduce an attribution-oriented Chain-of-Thought reasoning method to enhance the accuracy of attributions. This approach focuses the reasoning process on generating an attribution-centric output. Evaluations on two context-enhanced question-answering datasets using GPT-4 demonstrate improved accuracy and correctness of attributions. In addition the combination of our method with finetuning enhances the response and attribution accuracy of two smaller LLMs showing their potential to outperform GPT-4 in some cases.

In the rapidly evolving field of Large Language Models (LLMs) there is a critical need to thoroughly analyze their capabilities and risks. Central to our investigation are two novel elements. Firstly it is the innovative parallels between the statistical patterns of word relationships within LLMs and Martin Heideggers concepts of ready-to-hand and present-at-hand which encapsulate the utilitarian and scientific altitudes humans employ in interacting with the world. This comparison lays the groundwork for positioning LLMs as the digital counterpart to the Faculty of Verbal Knowledge shedding light on their capacity to emulate certain facets of human reasoning. Secondly a structural analysis of human reasoning viewed through Heideggers notion of truth as unconcealment is conducted This foundational principle enables us to map out the inputs and outputs of the reasoning system and divide reasoning into four distinct categories. Respective cognitive faculties are delineated allowing us to place LLMs within the broader schema of human reasoning thus clarifying their strengths and inherent limitations. Our findings reveal that while LLMs possess the capability for Direct Explicative Reasoning and Pseudo Rational Reasoning they fall short in authentic rational reasoning and have no creative reasoning capabilities due to the current lack of many analogous AI models such as the Faculty of Judgement. The potential and risks of LLMs when they are augmented with other AI technologies are also evaluated. The results indicate that although LLMs have achieved proficiency in some reasoning abilities the aspiration to match or exceed human intellectual capabilities is yet unattained. This research not only enriches our comprehension of LLMs but also propels forward the discourse on AIs potential and its bounds paving the way for future explorations into AIs evolving landscape.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities to comprehend human intentions engage in reasoning and design planning45;like behavior. To further unleash the power of LLMs to accomplish complex tasks there is a growing trend to build agent framework that equips LLMs such as ChatGPT with tool45;use abilities to connect with massive external APIs. In this work we introduce ModelScope45;Agent a general and customizable agent framework for real45;world applications based on open45;source LLMs as controllers. It provides a user45;friendly system library with customizable engine design to support model training on multiple open45;source LLMs while also enabling seamless integration with both model APIs and common APIs in a unified way. To equip the LLMs with tool45;use abilities a comprehensive framework has been proposed spanning over tool45;use data collection tool retrieval tool registration memory control customized model training and evaluation for practical real45;world applications. Finally we showcase ModelScopeGPT a real45;world intelligent assistant of ModelScope Community based on the ModelScope45;Agent framework which is able to connect open45;source LLMs with more than 1000 public AI models and localized community knowledge in ModelScope. The ModelScope45;Agent libraryfootnote123;https://github.com/modelscope/modelscope&#45;agent&#125; and online demofootnote123;https://modelscope.cn/studios/damo/ModelScopeGPT/summary&#125; are now publicly available.

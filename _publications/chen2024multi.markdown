The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
advancement of Role-Playing Agents (RPAs). However, current Role-Playing Agents
predominantly focus on mimicking a character's fundamental attributes while
neglecting the replication of linguistic style, and they are incapable of
effectively replicating characters when performing tasks beyond multi-turn
dialogues, which results in generated responses that lack authenticity. The
reason current RPAs lack this capability is due to the nature of existing
character datasets, which lack collections of character quotations and are
limited to multi-turn dialogue tasks, constraining the RPA's performance across
other task domains and failing to mimic a character's linguistic style. To
address this gap, we developed a multi-task role-playing dataset named MRstyle,
which encompasses a substantial number of real individuals along with their
quotations and covers seven different tasks. On this basis, we develop
StyleRPA, a Multi-Task Role-Playing Agent (MRPA) that significantly outperforms
recent open-source LLMs and RPAs baselines on 7 tasks including Dialogue,
Dictionary, Composition, Story Generation, Product Description, Music
Commentary, and Open Question Answering. The code and data will be released.

The ever-increasing volume of digital information necessitates efficient
methods for users to extract key insights from lengthy documents. Aspect-based
summarization offers a targeted approach, generating summaries focused on
specific aspects within a document. Despite advancements in aspect-based
summarization research, there is a continuous quest for improved model
performance. Given that large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to revolutionize diverse tasks within natural language processing,
particularly in the problem of summarization, this paper explores the potential
of fine-tuning LLMs for the aspect-based summarization task. We evaluate the
impact of fine-tuning open-source foundation LLMs, including Llama2, Mistral,
Gemma and Aya, on a publicly available domain-specific aspect based summary
dataset. We hypothesize that this approach will enable these models to
effectively identify and extract aspect-related information, leading to
superior quality aspect-based summaries compared to the state-of-the-art. We
establish a comprehensive evaluation framework to compare the performance of
fine-tuned LLMs against competing aspect-based summarization methods and
vanilla counterparts of the fine-tuned LLMs. Our work contributes to the field
of aspect-based summarization by demonstrating the efficacy of fine-tuning LLMs
for generating high-quality aspect-based summaries. Furthermore, it opens doors
for further exploration of using LLMs for targeted information extraction tasks
across various NLP domains.

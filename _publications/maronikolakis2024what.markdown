Large language models (LLMs) are poised to revolutionize the domain of online
fashion retail, enhancing customer experience and discovery of fashion online.
LLM-powered conversational agents introduce a new way of discovery by directly
interacting with customers, enabling them to express in their own ways, refine
their needs, obtain fashion and shopping advice that is relevant to their taste
and intent. For many tasks in e-commerce, such as finding a specific product,
conversational agents need to convert their interactions with a customer to a
specific call to different backend systems, e.g., a search system to showcase a
relevant set of products. Therefore, evaluating the capabilities of LLMs to
perform those tasks related to calling other services is vital. However, those
evaluations are generally complex, due to the lack of relevant and high quality
datasets, and do not align seamlessly with business needs, amongst others. To
this end, we created a multilingual evaluation dataset of 4k conversations
between customers and a fashion assistant in a large e-commerce fashion
platform to measure the capabilities of LLMs to serve as an assistant between
customers and a backend engine. We evaluate a range of models, showcasing how
our dataset scales to business needs and facilitates iterative development of
tools.

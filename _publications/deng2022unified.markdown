Recent years witnessed several advances in developing multi45;goal conversational recommender systems (MG45;CRS) that can proactively attract users interests and naturally lead user45;engaged dialogues with multiple conversational goals and diverse topics. Four tasks are often involved in MG45;CRS including Goal Planning Topic Prediction Item Recommendation and Response Generation. Most existing studies address only some of these tasks. To handle the whole problem of MG45;CRS modularized frameworks are adopted where each task is tackled independently without considering their interdependencies. In this work we propose a novel Unified MultI45;goal conversational recommeNDer system namely UniMIND. In specific we unify these four tasks with different formulations into the same sequence45;to45;sequence (Seq2Seq) paradigm. Prompt45;based learning strategies are investigated to endow the unified model with the capability of multi45;task learning. Finally the overall learning and inference procedure consists of three stages including multi45;task learning prompt45;based tuning and inference. Experimental results on two MG45;CRS benchmarks (DuRecDial and TG45;ReDial) show that UniMIND achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance on all tasks with a unified model. Extensive analyses and discussions are provided for shedding some new perspectives for MG45;CRS.

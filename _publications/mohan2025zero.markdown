Keyphrases are the essential topical phrases that summarize a document.
Keyphrase generation is a long-standing NLP task for automatically generating
keyphrases for a given document. While the task has been comprehensively
explored in the past via various models, only a few works perform some
preliminary analysis of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the task. Given the
impact of LLMs in the field of NLP, it is important to conduct a more thorough
examination of their potential for keyphrase generation. In this paper, we
attempt to meet this demand with our research agenda. Specifically, we focus on
the zero-shot capabilities of open-source instruction-tuned LLMs (Phi-3,
Llama-3) and the closed-source GPT-4o for this task. We systematically
investigate the effect of providing task-relevant specialized instructions in
the prompt. Moreover, we design task-specific counterparts to
self-consistency-style strategies for LLMs and show significant benefits from
our proposals over the baselines.

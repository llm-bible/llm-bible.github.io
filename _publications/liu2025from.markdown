In a conversational system, dynamically generating follow-up questions based
on context can help users explore information and provide a better user
experience. Humans are usually able to ask questions that involve some general
life knowledge and demonstrate higher order cognitive skills. However, the
questions generated by existing methods are often limited to shallow contextual
questions that are uninspiring and have a large gap to the human level. In this
paper, we propose a three-stage external knowledge-enhanced follow-up question
generation method, which generates questions by identifying contextual topics,
constructing a knowledge graph (KG) online, and finally combining these with a
large language model to generate the final question. The model generates
information-rich and exploratory follow-up questions by introducing external
common sense knowledge and performing a knowledge fusion operation. Experiments
show that compared to baseline models, our method generates questions that are
more informative and closer to human questioning levels while maintaining
contextual relevance.

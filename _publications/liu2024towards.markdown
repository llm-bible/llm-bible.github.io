Training Learning-to-Rank models for e-commerce product search ranking can be
challenging due to the lack of a gold standard of ranking relevance. In this
paper, we decompose ranking relevance into content-based and engagement-based
aspects, and we propose to leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for both label
and feature generation in model training, primarily aiming to improve the
model's predictive capability for content-based relevance. Additionally, we
introduce different sigmoid transformations on the LLM outputs to polarize
relevance scores in labeling, enhancing the model's ability to balance
content-based and engagement-based relevances and thus prioritize highly
relevant items overall. Comprehensive online tests and offline evaluations are
also conducted for the proposed design. Our work sheds light on advanced
strategies for integrating LLMs into e-commerce product search ranking model
training, offering a pathway to more effective and balanced models with
improved ranking relevance.

The EU AI Act (EUAIA) introduces requirements for AI systems which intersect
with the processes required to establish adversarial robustness. However, given
the ambiguous language of regulation and the dynamicity of adversarial attacks,
developers of systems with highly complex models such as LLMs may find their
effort to be duplicated without the assurance of having achieved either
compliance or robustness. This paper presents a functional architecture that
focuses on bridging the two properties, by introducing components with clear
reference to their source. Taking the detection layer recommended by the
literature, and the reporting layer required by the law, we aim to support
developers and auditors with a reasoning layer based on knowledge augmentation
(rules, assurance cases, contextual mappings). Our findings demonstrate a novel
direction for ensuring LLMs deployed in the EU are both compliant and
adversarially robust, which underpin trustworthiness.

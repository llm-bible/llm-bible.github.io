The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has substantially influenced natural language processing demonstrating exceptional results across various tasks. In this study we employ Introspective Tips to facilitate LLMs in self-optimizing their decision-making. By introspectively examining trajectories LLM refines its policy by generating succinct and valuable tips. Our method enhances the agents performance in both few-shot and zero-shot learning situations by considering three essential scenarios learning from the agents past experiences integrating expert demonstrations and generalizing across diverse games. Importantly we accomplish these improvements without fine-tuning the LLM parameters; rather we adjust the prompt to generalize insights from the three aforementioned situations. Our framework not only supports but also emphasizes the advantage of employing LLM in in-contxt decision-making. Experiments involving over 100 games in TextWorld illustrate the superior performance of our approach.

Agents have demonstrated their potential in scientific reasoning tasks
through large language models. However, they often face challenges such as
insufficient accuracy and degeneration of thought when handling complex
reasoning tasks, which impede their performance. To overcome these issues, we
propose the Reactive and Reflection agents with Multi-Path Reasoning (RR-MP)
Framework, aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our approach
improves scientific reasoning accuracy by employing a multi-path reasoning
mechanism where each path consists of a reactive agent and a reflection agent
that collaborate to prevent degeneration of thought inherent in single-agent
reliance. Additionally, the RR-MP framework does not require additional
training; it utilizes multiple dialogue instances for each reasoning path and a
separate summarizer to consolidate insights from all paths. This design
integrates diverse perspectives and strengthens reasoning across each path. We
conducted zero-shot and few-shot evaluations on tasks involving moral
scenarios, college-level physics, and mathematics. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches, highlighting the
effectiveness and advantages of the RR-MP framework in managing complex
scientific reasoning tasks.

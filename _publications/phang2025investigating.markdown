As AI chatbots see increased adoption and integration into everyday life,
questions have been raised about the potential impact of human-like or
anthropomorphic AI on users. In this work, we investigate the extent to which
interactions with ChatGPT (with a focus on Advanced Voice Mode) may impact
users' emotional well-being, behaviors and experiences through two parallel
studies. To study the affective use of AI chatbots, we perform large-scale
automated analysis of ChatGPT platform usage in a privacy-preserving manner,
analyzing over 3 million conversations for affective cues and surveying over
4,000 users on their perceptions of ChatGPT. To investigate whether there is a
relationship between model usage and emotional well-being, we conduct an
Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved randomized controlled trial (RCT) on
close to 1,000 participants over 28 days, examining changes in their emotional
well-being as they interact with ChatGPT under different experimental settings.
In both on-platform data analysis and the RCT, we observe that very high usage
correlates with increased self-reported indicators of dependence. From our RCT,
we find that the impact of voice-based interactions on emotional well-being to
be highly nuanced, and influenced by factors such as the user's initial
emotional state and total usage duration. Overall, our analysis reveals that a
small number of users are responsible for a disproportionate share of the most
affective cues.

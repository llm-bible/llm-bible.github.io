Despite the recent broad adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) across
various domains, their potential for enriching information systems in
extracting and exploring Linked Data (LD) and Resource Description Framework
(RDF) triplestores has not been extensively explored. This paper examines the
integration of LLMs within existing systems, emphasising the enhancement of
conversational user interfaces (UIs) and their capabilities for data extraction
by producing more accurate SPARQL queries without the requirement for model
retraining. Typically, conversational UI models necessitate retraining with the
introduction of new datasets or updates, limiting their functionality as
general-purpose extraction tools. Our approach addresses this limitation by
incorporating LLMs into the conversational UI workflow, significantly enhancing
their ability to comprehend and process user queries effectively. By leveraging
the advanced natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, our method
improves RDF entity extraction within web systems employing conventional
chatbots. This integration facilitates a more nuanced and context-aware
interaction model, critical for handling the complex query patterns often
encountered in RDF datasets and Linked Open Data (LOD) endpoints. The
evaluation of this methodology shows a marked enhancement in system
expressivity and the accuracy of responses to user queries, indicating a
promising direction for future research in this area. This investigation not
only underscores the versatility of LLMs in enhancing existing information
systems but also sets the stage for further explorations into their potential
applications within more specialised domains of web information systems.

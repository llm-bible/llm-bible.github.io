Long-term memory plays a critical role in personal interaction considering long-term memory can better leverage world knowledge historical information and preferences in dialogues. Our research introduces PerLTQA an innovative QA dataset that combines semantic and episodic memories including world knowledge profiles social relationships events and dialogues. This dataset is collected to investigate the use of personalized memories focusing on social interactions and events in the QA task. PerLTQA features two types of memory and a comprehensive benchmark of 8593 questions for 30 characters facilitating the exploration and application of personalized memories in Large Language Models (LLMs). Based on PerLTQA we propose a novel framework for memory integration and generation consisting of three main components Memory Classification Memory Retrieval and Memory Synthesis. We evaluate this framework using five LLMs and three retrievers. Experimental results demonstrate that BERT-based classification models significantly outperform LLMs such as ChatGLM3 and ChatGPT in the memory classification task. Furthermore our study highlights the importance of effective memory integration in the QA task.

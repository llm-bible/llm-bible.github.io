Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models have become successful but their performance remains poor when translating on new domains with a limited number of data. In this paper we present a novel approach Epi45;Curriculum to address low45;resource domain adaptation (DA) which contains a new episodic training framework along with denoised curriculum learning. Our episodic training framework enhances the models robustness to domain shift by episodically exposing the encoder/decoder to an inexperienced decoder/encoder. The denoised curriculum learning filters the noised data and further improves the models adaptability by gradually guiding the learning process from easy to more difficult tasks. Experiments on English45;German and English45;Romanian translation show that (i) Epi45;Curriculum improves both models robustness and adaptability in seen and unseen domains; (ii) Our episodic training framework enhances the encoder and decoders robustness to domain shift.

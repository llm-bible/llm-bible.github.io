Despite achieving remarkable performance, machine translation (MT) research
remains underexplored in terms of translating cultural elements in languages,
such as idioms, proverbs, and colloquial expressions. This paper investigates
the capability of state-of-the-art neural machine translation (NMT) and large
language models (LLMs) in translating proverbs, which are deeply rooted in
cultural contexts. We construct a translation dataset of standalone proverbs
and proverbs in conversation for four language pairs. Our experiments show that
the studied models can achieve good translation between languages with similar
cultural backgrounds, and LLMs generally outperform NMT models in proverb
translation. Furthermore, we find that current automatic evaluation metrics
such as BLEU, CHRF++ and COMET are inadequate for reliably assessing the
quality of proverb translation, highlighting the need for more culturally aware
evaluation metrics.

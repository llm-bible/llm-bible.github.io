In this work, we introduce the task of life-long personalization of large
language models. While recent mainstream efforts in the LLM community mainly
focus on scaling data and compute for improved capabilities of LLMs, we argue
that it is also very important to enable LLM systems, or language agents, to
continuously adapt to the diverse and ever-changing profiles of every distinct
user and provide up-to-date personalized assistance. We provide a clear task
formulation and introduce a simple, general, effective, and scalable framework
for life-long personalization of LLM systems and language agents. To facilitate
future research on LLM personalization, we also introduce methods to synthesize
realistic benchmarks and robust evaluation metrics. We will release all codes
and data for building and benchmarking life-long personalized LLM systems.

We present ImageBind-LLM a multi-modality instruction tuning method of large language models (LLMs) via ImageBind. Existing works mainly focus on language and image instruction tuning different from which our ImageBind-LLM can respond to multi-modality conditions including audio 3D point clouds video and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training. During training we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space between LLaMA and ImageBinds image encoder. Then the image features transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in LLaMA which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of ImageBind the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference the multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders and processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image features extracted by ImageBind which effectively mitigates the training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably with our approach ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate significant language generation quality.

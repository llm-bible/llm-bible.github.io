While Neural Machine Translation (NMT) represents the leading approach to Machine Translation (MT) the outputs of NMT models still require translation post45;editing to rectify errors and enhance quality under critical settings. In this work we formalize the task of direct translation post45;editing with Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the use of GPT45;4 to automatically post45;edit NMT outputs across several language pairs. Our results demonstrate that GPT45;4 is adept at translation post45;editing producing meaningful and trustworthy edits to translations that help improve its general quality as well as remove different classes of major errors in translations. In particular human evaluations on assessing edit trustworthiness show that GPT45;4 exhibits a large improvement over the prior state45;of45;the45;art LLM. Notably we improve upon state45;of45;the45;art performance on WMT45;22 English45;Chinese English45;German Chinese45;English and German45;English language pairs using GPT45;4 based post45;editing as evaluated by state45;of45;the45;art MT quality metrics. However we also show that GPT45;4 could produce hallucinated edits thereby urging caution in its use as an expert translation post45;editor.

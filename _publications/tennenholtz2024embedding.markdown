We propose a novel approach for training large language models (LLMs) to adhere to objectives defined within a latent embedding space. Our method leverages reinforcement learning (RL) treating a pre45;trained LLM as an environment. Our embedding45;aligned guided language (EAGLE) agent is trained to iteratively steer the LLMs generation towards optimal regions of the latent embedding space w.r.t. some predefined criterion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EAGLE agent using the MovieLens 25M dataset to surface content gaps that satisfy latent user demand. We also demonstrate the benefit of using an optimal design of a state45;dependent action set to improve EAGLEs efficiency. Our work paves the way for controlled and grounded text generation using LLMs ensuring consistency with domain45;specific knowledge and data representations.

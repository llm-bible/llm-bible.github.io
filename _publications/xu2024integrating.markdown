Despite the well-established importance of feedback in education, the
application of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-generated feedback, particularly
from language models like ChatGPT, remains understudied in translation
education. This study investigates the engagement of master's students in
translation with ChatGPT-generated feedback during their revision process. A
mixed-methods approach, combining a translation-and-revision experiment with
quantitative and qualitative analyses, was employed to examine the feedback,
translations pre-and post-revision, the revision process, and student
reflections. The results reveal complex interrelations among cognitive,
affective, and behavioural dimensions influencing students' engagement with AI
feedback and their subsequent revisions. Specifically, the findings indicate
that students invested considerable cognitive effort in the revision process,
despite finding the feedback comprehensible. Additionally, they exhibited
moderate affective satisfaction with the feedback model. Behaviourally, their
actions were largely influenced by cognitive and affective factors, although
some inconsistencies were observed. This research provides novel insights into
the potential applications of AI-generated feedback in translation teachingand
opens avenues for further investigation into the integration of AI tools in
language teaching settings.

Foundation models exhibit significant capabilities in decision-making and logical deductions. Nonetheless a continuing discourse persists regarding their genuine understanding of the world as opposed to mere stochastic mimicry. This paper meticulously examines a simple transformer trained for Othello extending prior research to enhance comprehension of the emergent world model of Othello-GPT. The investigation reveals that Othello-GPT encapsulates a linear representation of opposing pieces a factor that causally steers its decision-making process. This paper further elucidates the interplay between the linear world representation and causal decision-making and their dependence on layer depth and model complexity. We have made the code public.

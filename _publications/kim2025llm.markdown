Understanding user satisfaction with conversational systems, known as User
Satisfaction Estimation (USE), is essential for assessing dialogue quality and
enhancing user experiences. However, existing methods for USE face challenges
due to limited understanding of underlying reasons for user dissatisfaction and
the high costs of annotating user intentions. To address these challenges, we
propose PRAISE (Plan and Retrieval Alignment for Interpretable Satisfaction
Estimation), an interpretable framework for effective user satisfaction
prediction. PRAISE operates through three key modules. The Strategy Planner
develops strategies, which are natural language criteria for classifying user
satisfaction. The Feature Retriever then incorporates knowledge on user
satisfaction from Large Language Models (LLMs) and retrieves relevance features
from utterances. Finally, the Score Analyzer evaluates strategy predictions and
classifies user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate that PRAISE
achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks for the USE task.
Beyond its superior performance, PRAISE offers additional benefits. It enhances
interpretability by providing instance-level explanations through effective
alignment of utterances with strategies. Moreover, PRAISE operates more
efficiently than existing approaches by eliminating the need for LLMs during
the inference phase.

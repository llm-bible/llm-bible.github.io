This paper introduces WeChat's participation in WMT 2022 shared biomedical
translation task on Chinese to English. Our systems are based on the
Transformer, and use several different Transformer structures to improve the
quality of translation. In our experiments, we employ data filtering, data
generation, several variants of Transformer, fine-tuning and model ensemble.
Our Chinese\\(\to\\)English system, named Summer, achieves the highest BLEU score
among all submissions.

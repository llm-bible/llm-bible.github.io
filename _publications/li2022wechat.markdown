This paper introduces WeChats participation in WMT 2022 shared biomedical translation task on Chinese to English. Our systems are based on the Transformer and use several different Transformer structures to improve the quality of translation. In our experiments we employ data filtering data generation several variants of Transformer fine45;tuning and model ensemble. Our ChinesetoEnglish system named Summer achieves the highest BLEU score among all submissions.

Large language models (LLMs) have recently become a popular topic in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) research with companies such as Google Amazon Facebook Amazon Tesla and Apple (GAFA) investing heavily in their development. These models are trained on massive amounts of data and can be used for a wide range of tasks including language translation text generation and question answering. However the computational resources required to train and run these models are substantial and the cost of hardware and electricity can be prohibitive for research labs that do not have the funding and resources of the GAFA. In this paper we will examine the impact of LLMs on AI research. The pace at which such models are generated as well as the range of domains covered is an indication of the trend which not only the public but also the scientific community is currently experiencing. We give some examples on how to use such models in research by focusing on GPT3.5/ChatGPT3.4 and ChatGPT4 at the current state and show that such a range of capabilities in a single system is a strong sign of approaching general intelligence. Innovations integrating such models will also expand along the maturation of such AI systems and exhibit unforeseeable applications that will have important impacts on several aspects of our societies.

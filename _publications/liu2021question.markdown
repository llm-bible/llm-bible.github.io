We propose CodeQA a free-form question answering dataset for the purpose of source code comprehension given a code snippet and a question a textual answer is required to be generated. CodeQA contains a Java dataset with 119778 question-answer pairs and a Python dataset with 70085 question-answer pairs. To obtain natural and faithful questions and answers we implement syntactic rules and semantic analysis to transform code comments into question-answer pairs. We present the construction process and conduct systematic analysis of our dataset. Experiment results achieved by several neural baselines on our dataset are shown and discussed. While research on question-answering and machine reading comprehension develops rapidly few prior work has drawn attention to code question answering. This new dataset can serve as a useful research benchmark for source code comprehension.

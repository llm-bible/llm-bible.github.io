Several attempts have been made to implement text command control for game
agents. However, current technologies are limited to processing predefined
format commands. This paper proposes a pioneering text command control system
for a game agent that can understand natural language commands expressed in
free-form. The proposed system uses a large language model (LLM) for code
generation to interpret and transform natural language commands into behavior
branch, a proposed knowledge expression based on behavior trees, which
facilitates execution by the game agent. This study conducted empirical
validation within a game environment that simulates a Pok\'emon game and
involved multiple participants. The results confirmed the system's ability to
understand and carry out natural language commands, representing a noteworthy
in the realm of real-time language interactive game agents.

We introduce MIA-Bench a new benchmark designed to evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on their ability to strictly adhere to complex instructions. Our benchmark comprises a diverse set of 400 image-prompt pairs each crafted to challenge the models compliance with layered instructions in generating accurate responses that satisfy specific requested patterns. Evaluation results from a wide array of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal significant variations in performance highlighting areas for improvement in instruction fidelity. Additionally we create extra training data and explore supervised fine-tuning to enhance the models ability to strictly follow instructions without compromising performance on other tasks. We hope this benchmark not only serves as a tool for measuring MLLM adherence to instructions but also guides future developments in MLLM training methods.

With the introduction of ChatGPT OpenAI made large language models (LLM) accessible to users with limited IT expertise. However users with no background in natural language processing (NLP) might lack a proper understanding of LLMs. Thus the awareness of their inherent limitations and therefore will take the systems output at face value. In this paper we systematically analyse prompts and the generated responses to identify possible problematic issues with a special focus on gender biases which users need to be aware of when processing the systems output. We explore how ChatGPT reacts in English and German if prompted to answer from a female male or neutral perspective. In an in-depth investigation we examine selected prompts and analyse to what extent responses differ if the system is prompted several times in an identical way. On this basis we show that ChatGPT is indeed useful for helping non-IT users draft texts for their daily work. However it is absolutely crucial to thoroughly check the systems responses for biases as well as for syntactic and grammatical mistakes.

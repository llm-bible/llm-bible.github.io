Reinforcement learning (RL) enhances large language models (LLMs) in complex, long-chain-of-thought (long-CoT) reasoning. The advanced VAPO framework, despite sophisticated mechanisms like Decoupled GAE, theoretically faces fundamental limitations in comprehensively modeling and leveraging deep, long-term value for fine-grained, step-by-step policy guidance in extended reasoning chains. We argue these limitations stem from inherent difficulties in credit assignment, value function representational capacity with temporally abstracted goals, and translating global value signals into local policy improvements, especially with sparse rewards. Our theoretical analysis examines these aspects to illuminate VAPO's boundaries in long-term value modeling, aiming to deepen understanding of current RL for advanced reasoning and suggest future research for more robust LLM agents.

Recent advancements in AI, particularly in large language models (LLMs) like
ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini, have prompted questions about their proximity to
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This study compares LLM performance on
educational benchmarks with Americans' average educational attainment and
literacy levels, using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and technical reports.
Results show that LLMs significantly outperform human benchmarks in tasks such
as undergraduate knowledge and advanced reading comprehension, indicating
substantial progress toward AGI. However, true AGI requires broader cognitive
assessments. The study highlights the implications for AI development,
education, and societal impact, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and
ethical considerations.

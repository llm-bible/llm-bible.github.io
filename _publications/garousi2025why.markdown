Context: ChatGPT and other large language models (LLMs) are widely used
across healthcare, business, economics, engineering, and software engineering
(SE). Despite their popularity, concerns persist about their reliability,
especially their error rates across domains and the software development
lifecycle (SDLC).
  Objective: This study synthesizes and quantifies ChatGPT's reported error
rates across major domains and SE tasks aligned with SDLC phases. It provides
an evidence-based view of where ChatGPT excels, where it fails, and how
reliability varies by task, domain, and model version (GPT-3.5, GPT-4,
GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o).
  Method: A Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) was conducted, gathering data
from academic studies, reports, benchmarks, and grey literature up to 2025.
Factual, reasoning, coding, and interpretive errors were considered. Data were
grouped by domain and SE phase and visualized using boxplots to show error
distributions.
  Results: Error rates vary across domains and versions. In healthcare, rates
ranged from 8% to 83%. Business and economics saw error rates drop from ~50%
with GPT-3.5 to 15-20% with GPT-4. Engineering tasks averaged 20-30%.
Programming success reached 87.5%, though complex debugging still showed over
50% errors. In SE, requirements and design phases showed lower error rates
(~5-20%), while coding, testing, and maintenance phases had higher variability
(10-50%). Upgrades from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 improved reliability.
  Conclusion: Despite improvements, ChatGPT still exhibits non-negligible error
rates varying by domain, task, and SDLC phase. Full reliance without human
oversight remains risky, especially in critical settings. Continuous evaluation
and critical validation are essential to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness.

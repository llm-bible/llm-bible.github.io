This paper assesses the potential for large language models (LLMs) to serve as assistive tools in the creative writing process by means of a single in45;depth case study. In the course of the study we develop interactive and multi45;voice prompting strategies that interleave background descriptions (scene setting plot elements) instructions that guide composition samples of text in the target style and critical discussion of the given samples. We qualitatively evaluate the results from a literary critical perspective as well as from the standpoint of computational creativity (a sub45;field of artificial intelligence). Our findings lend support to the view that the sophistication of the results that can be achieved with an LLM mirrors the sophistication of the prompting.

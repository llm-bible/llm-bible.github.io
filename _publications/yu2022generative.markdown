XAI with natural language processing aims to produce human-readable
explanations as evidence for AI decision-making, which addresses explainability
and transparency. However, from an HCI perspective, the current approaches only
focus on delivering a single explanation, which fails to account for the
diversity of human thoughts and experiences in language. This paper thus
addresses this gap, by proposing a generative XAI framework, INTERACTION
(explaIn aNd predicT thEn queRy with contextuAl CondiTional varIational
autO-eNcoder). Our novel framework presents explanation in two steps: (step
one) Explanation and Label Prediction; and (step two) Diverse Evidence
Generation. We conduct intensive experiments with the Transformer architecture
on a benchmark dataset, e-SNLI. Our method achieves competitive or better
performance against state-of-the-art baseline models on explanation generation
(up to 4.7% gain in BLEU) and prediction (up to 4.4% gain in accuracy) in step
one; it can also generate multiple diverse explanations in step two.

TIPO (Text-to-Image Prompt Optimization) introduces an efficient approach for
automatic prompt refinement in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Starting from
simple user prompts, TIPO leverages a lightweight pre-trained model to expand
these prompts into richer, detailed versions. Conceptually, TIPO samples
refined prompts from a targeted sub-distribution within the broader semantic
space, preserving the original intent while significantly improving visual
quality, coherence, and detail. Unlike resource-intensive methods based on
large language models (LLMs) or reinforcement learning (RL), TIPO provides
computational efficiency and scalability, opening new possibilities for
effective, automated prompt engineering in T2I tasks.
  We provide visual results, human preference report to investigate TIPO's
effectiveness. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
substantial improvements in aesthetic quality, significant reduction of visual
artifacts, and enhanced alignment with target distributions along with
significant human preference proficiency. These results highlight the
importance of targeted prompt engineering in text-to-image tasks and indicate
broader opportunities for automated prompt refinement.

Following the hype around OpenAIs ChatGPT conversational agent the last straw in the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that demonstrate emergent unprecedented zero45;shot capabilities we audit the latest OpenAIs GPT45;3.5 model gpt45;3.545;turbo the first available ChatGPT model in the LexGLUE benchmark in a zero45;shot fashion providing examples in a templated instruction45;following format. The results indicate that ChatGPT achieves an average micro45;F1 score of 47.637; across LexGLUE tasks surpassing the baseline guessing rates. Notably the model performs exceptionally well in some datasets achieving micro45;F1 scores of 62.837; and 70.237; in the ECtHR B and LEDGAR datasets respectively. The code base and model predictions are available for review on https://github.com/coastalcph/zeroshot&#95;lexglue.

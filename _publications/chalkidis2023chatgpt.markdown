Following the hype around OpenAIs ChatGPT conversational agent the last straw in the recent development of Large Language Models (LLMs) that demonstrate emergent unprecedented zero-shot capabilities we audit the latest OpenAIs GPT-3.5 model gpt-3.5-turbo the first available ChatGPT model in the LexGLUE benchmark in a zero-shot fashion providing examples in a templated instruction-following format. The results indicate that ChatGPT achieves an average micro-F1 score of 47.6 across LexGLUE tasks surpassing the baseline guessing rates. Notably the model performs exceptionally well in some datasets achieving micro-F1 scores of 62.8 and 70.2 in the ECtHR B and LEDGAR datasets respectively. The code base and model predictions are available for review on https://github.com/coastalcph/zeroshot_lexglue.

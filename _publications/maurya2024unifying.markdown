In this paper, we investigate whether current state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) are effective as AI tutors and whether they demonstrate
pedagogical abilities necessary for good AI tutoring in educational dialogues.
Previous efforts towards evaluation have been limited to subjective protocols
and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified evaluation taxonomy
with eight pedagogical dimensions based on key learning sciences principles,
which is designed to assess the pedagogical value of LLM-powered AI tutor
responses grounded in student mistakes or confusions in the mathematical
domain. We release MRBench - a new evaluation benchmark containing 192
conversations and 1,596 responses from seven state-of-the-art LLM-based and
human tutors, providing gold annotations for eight pedagogical dimensions. We
assess reliability of the popular Prometheus2 and Llama-3.1-8B LLMs as
evaluators and analyze each tutor's pedagogical abilities, highlighting which
LLMs are good tutors and which ones are more suitable as question-answering
systems. We believe that the presented taxonomy, benchmark, and human-annotated
labels will streamline the evaluation process and help track the progress in AI
tutors' development.

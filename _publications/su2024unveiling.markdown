Large language models (LLMs) equipped with chain-of-thoughts (CoT) prompting
have shown significant multi-step reasoning capabilities in factual content
like mathematics, commonsense, and logic. However, their performance in
narrative reasoning, which demands greater abstraction capabilities, remains
unexplored. This study utilizes tropes in movie synopses to assess the abstract
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art LLMs and uncovers their low
performance. We introduce a trope-wise querying approach to address these
challenges and boost the F1 score by 11.8 points. Moreover, while prior studies
suggest that CoT enhances multi-step reasoning, this study shows CoT can cause
hallucinations in narrative content, reducing GPT-4's performance. We also
introduce an Adversarial Injection method to embed trope-related text tokens
into movie synopses without explicit tropes, revealing CoT's heightened
sensitivity to such injections. Our comprehensive analysis provides insights
for future research directions.

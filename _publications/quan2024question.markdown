In this paper, we introduce EconLogicQA, a rigorous benchmark designed to
assess the sequential reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
within the intricate realms of economics, business, and supply chain
management. Diverging from traditional benchmarks that predict subsequent
events individually, EconLogicQA poses a more challenging task: it requires
models to discern and sequence multiple interconnected events, capturing the
complexity of economic logics. EconLogicQA comprises an array of multi-event
scenarios derived from economic articles, which necessitate an insightful
understanding of both temporal and logical event relationships. Through
comprehensive evaluations, we exhibit that EconLogicQA effectively gauges a
LLM's proficiency in navigating the sequential complexities inherent in
economic contexts. We provide a detailed description of EconLogicQA dataset and
shows the outcomes from evaluating the benchmark across various leading-edge
LLMs, thereby offering a thorough perspective on their sequential reasoning
potential in economic contexts. Our benchmark dataset is available at

We propose an approach for continuous prediction of turn-taking and
backchanneling locations in spoken dialogue by fusing a neural acoustic model
with a large language model (LLM). Experiments on the Switchboard human-human
conversation dataset demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the
baseline models with single modality. We also develop a novel multi-task
instruction fine-tuning strategy to further benefit from LLM-encoded knowledge
for understanding the tasks and conversational contexts, leading to additional
improvements. Our approach demonstrates the potential of combined LLMs and
acoustic models for a more natural and conversational interaction between
humans and speech-enabled AI agents.

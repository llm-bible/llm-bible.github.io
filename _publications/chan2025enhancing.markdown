This research explores the opportunities of Generative AI (GenAI) in the
realm of higher education through the design and development of a multimodal
chatbot for an undergraduate course. Leveraging the ChatGPT API for nuanced
text-based interactions and Google Bard for advanced image analysis and
diagram-to-code conversions, we showcase the potential of GenAI in addressing a
broad spectrum of educational queries. Additionally, the chatbot presents a
file-based analyser designed for educators, offering deep insights into student
feedback via sentiment and emotion analysis, and summarising course evaluations
with key metrics. These combinations highlight the crucial role of multimodal
conversational AI in enhancing teaching and learning processes, promising
significant advancements in educational adaptability, engagement, and feedback
analysis. By demonstrating a practical web application, this research
underlines the imperative for integrating GenAI technologies to foster more
dynamic and responsive educational environments, ultimately contributing to
improved educational outcomes and pedagogical strategies.

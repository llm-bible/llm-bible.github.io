Large Language Models (LLMs) have made extraordinary progress in the field of Artificial Intelligence and have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a large variety of tasks and domains. However as we venture closer to creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) systems we recognize the need to supplement LLMs with long-term memory to overcome the context window limitation and more importantly to create a foundation for sustained reasoning cumulative learning and long-term user interaction. In this paper we propose RecallM a novel architecture for providing LLMs with an adaptable and updatable long-term memory mechanism. Unlike previous methods the RecallM architecture is particularly effective at belief updating and maintaining a temporal understanding of the knowledge provided to it. We demonstrate through various experiments the effectiveness of this architecture. Furthermore through our own temporal understanding and belief updating experiments we show that RecallM is four times more effective than using a vector database for updating knowledge previously stored in long-term memory. We also demonstrate that RecallM shows competitive performance on general question-answering and in-context learning tasks.

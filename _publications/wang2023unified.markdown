While the recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) constitute a significant leap forward in the field these models are predominantly confined to the realm of input45;side multimodal comprehension lacking the capacity for multimodal content generation. To fill this gap we present GPT4Video a unified multi45;model framework that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capability of both video understanding and generation. Specifically we develop an instruction45;following45;based approach integrated with the stable diffusion generative model which has demonstrated to effectively and securely handle video generation scenarios. GPT4Video offers the following benefits 1) It exhibits impressive capabilities in both video understanding and generation scenarios. For example GPT4Video outperforms Valley by 11.837; on the Video Question Answering task and surpasses NExt45;GPT by 2.337; on the Text to Video generation task. 2) it endows the LLM/MLLM with video generation capabilities without requiring additional training parameters and can flexibly interface with a wide range of models to perform video generation. 3) it maintains a safe and healthy conversation not only in output45;side but also the input side in an end45;to45;end manner. Qualitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that GPT4Video holds the potential to function as a effective safe and Humanoid45;like video assistant that can handle both video understanding and generation scenarios.

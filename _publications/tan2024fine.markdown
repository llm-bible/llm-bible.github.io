Purpose: To assess the alignment of GPT-4-based evaluation to human clinician
experts, for the evaluation of responses to ophthalmology-related patient
queries generated by fine-tuned LLM chatbots. Methods: 400 ophthalmology
questions and paired answers were created by ophthalmologists to represent
commonly asked patient questions, divided into fine-tuning (368; 92%), and
testing (40; 8%). We find-tuned 5 different LLMs, including LLAMA2-7b,
LLAMA2-7b-Chat, LLAMA2-13b, and LLAMA2-13b-Chat. For the testing dataset,
additional 8 glaucoma QnA pairs were included. 200 responses to the testing
dataset were generated by 5 fine-tuned LLMs for evaluation. A customized
clinical evaluation rubric was used to guide GPT-4 evaluation, grounded on
clinical accuracy, relevance, patient safety, and ease of understanding. GPT-4
evaluation was then compared against ranking by 5 clinicians for clinical
alignment. Results: Among all fine-tuned LLMs, GPT-3.5 scored the highest
(87.1%), followed by LLAMA2-13b (80.9%), LLAMA2-13b-chat (75.5%),
LLAMA2-7b-Chat (70%) and LLAMA2-7b (68.8%) based on the GPT-4 evaluation. GPT-4
evaluation demonstrated significant agreement with human clinician rankings,
with Spearman and Kendall Tau correlation coefficients of 0.90 and 0.80
respectively; while correlation based on Cohen Kappa was more modest at 0.50.
Notably, qualitative analysis and the glaucoma sub-analysis revealed clinical
inaccuracies in the LLM-generated responses, which were appropriately
identified by the GPT-4 evaluation. Conclusion: The notable clinical alignment
of GPT-4 evaluation highlighted its potential to streamline the clinical
evaluation of LLM chatbot responses to healthcare-related queries. By
complementing the existing clinician-dependent manual grading, this efficient
and automated evaluation could assist the validation of future developments in
LLM applications for healthcare.

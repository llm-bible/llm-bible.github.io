Efficiently fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for specific tasks presents a considerable challenge in natural language processing. Traditional methods like prompt or prefix tuning typically rely on arbitrary tokens for training leading to prolonged training times and generalized token use across various class labels. To address these issues this paper introduces L-Tuning an efficient fine-tuning approach designed for classification tasks within the Natural Language Inference (NLI) framework. Diverging from conventional methods L-Tuning focuses on the fine-tuning of label tokens processed through a pre-trained LLM thereby harnessing its pre-existing semantic knowledge. This technique not only improves the fine-tuning accuracy and efficiency but also facilitates the generation of distinct label embeddings for each class enhancing the models training nuance. Our experimental results indicate a significant improvement in training efficiency and classification accuracy with L-Tuning compared to traditional approaches marking a promising advancement in fine-tuning LLMs for complex language tasks.

In this paper, we evaluate the creative fiction writing abilities of a fine-tuned small language model (SLM), BART-large, and compare its performance to human writers and two large language models (LLMs): GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. Our evaluation consists of two experiments: (i) a human study in which 68 participants rated short stories from humans and the SLM on grammaticality, relevance, creativity, and attractiveness, and (ii) a qualitative linguistic analysis examining the textual characteristics of stories produced by each model. In the first experiment, BART-large outscored average human writers overall (2.11 vs. 1.85), a 14% relative improvement, though the slight human advantage in creativity was not statistically significant. In the second experiment, qualitative analysis showed that while GPT-4o demonstrated near-perfect coherence and used less cliche phrases, it tended to produce more predictable language, with only 3% of its synopses featuring surprising associations (compared to 15% for BART). These findings highlight how model size and fine-tuning influence the balance between creativity, fluency, and coherence in creative writing tasks, and demonstrate that smaller models can, in certain contexts, rival both humans and larger models.

This study explores the idea of AI Personality or AInality suggesting that Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit patterns similar to human personalities. Assuming that LLMs share these patterns with humans we investigate using human-centered psychometric tests such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD3) to identify and confirm LLM personality types. By introducing role-play prompts we demonstrate the adaptability of LLMs showing their ability to switch dynamically between different personality types. Using projective tests such as the Washington University Sentence Completion Test (WUSCT) we uncover hidden aspects of LLM personalities that are not easily accessible through direct questioning. Projective tests allowed for a deep exploration of LLMs cognitive processes and thought patterns and gave us a multidimensional view of AInality. Our machine learning analysis revealed that LLMs exhibit distinct AInality traits and manifest diverse personality types demonstrating dynamic shifts in response to external instructions. This study pioneers the application of projective tests on LLMs shedding light on their diverse and adaptable AInality traits.

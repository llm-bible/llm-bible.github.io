We present OmniJARVIS a novel Vision45;Language45;Action (VLA) model for open45;world instruction45;following agents in open45;world Minecraft. Compared to prior works that either emit textual goals to separate controllers or produce the control command directly OmniJARVIS seeks a different path to ensure both strong reasoning and efficient decision45;making capabilities via unified tokenization of multimodal interaction data. First we introduce a self45;supervised approach to learn a behavior encoder that produces discretized tokens for behavior trajectories Ï„ = 123;o95;0 a95;0 dots125; and an imitation learning (IL) policy decoder conditioned on these tokens. These additional behavior tokens will be augmented to the vocabulary of pretrained Multimodal Language Models (MLMs). With this encoder we then pack long45;term multimodal interactions involving task instructions memories thoughts observations textual responses behavior trajectories etc. into unified token sequences and model them with autoregressive transformers. Thanks to the semantically meaningful behavior tokens the resulting VLA model OmniJARVIS can reason (by producing chain45;of45;thoughts) plan answer questions and act (by producing behavior tokens for the IL policy decoder). OmniJARVIS demonstrates excellent performances on a comprehensive collection of atomic programmatic and open45;ended tasks in open45;world Minecraft. Our analysis further unveils the crucial design principles in interaction data formation unified tokenization and its scaling potentials.

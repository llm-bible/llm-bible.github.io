Domain adaptation has recently become a key problem in dialogue systems research. Deep learning while being the preferred technique for modeling such systems works best given massive training data. However in the real45;world scenario such resources arent available for every new domain so the ability to train with a few dialogue examples can be considered essential. Pre45;training on large data sources and adapting to the target data has become the standard method for few45;shot problems within the deep learning framework. In this paper we present the winning entry at the fast domain adaptation task of DSTC8 a hybrid generative45;retrieval model based on GPT45;2 fine45;tuned to the multi45;domain MetaLWOz dataset. Robust and diverse in response generation our model uses retrieval logic as a fallback being SoTA on MetaLWOz in human evaluation (437; improvement over the 2nd place system) and attaining competitive generalization performance in adaptation to the unseen MultiWOZ dataset.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated surprising performance on many tasks including writing supportive messages that display empathy. Here we had these models generate empathic messages in response to posts describing common life experiences such as workplace situations parenting relationships and other anxiety- and anger-eliciting situations. Across two studies (N=192 202) we showed human raters a variety of responses written by several models (GPT4 Turbo Llama2 and Mistral) and had people rate these responses on how empathic they seemed to be. We found that LLM-generated responses were consistently rated as more empathic than human-written responses. Linguistic analyses also show that these models write in distinct predictable styles in terms of their use of punctuation emojis and certain words. These results highlight the potential of using LLMs to enhance human peer support in contexts where empathy is important.

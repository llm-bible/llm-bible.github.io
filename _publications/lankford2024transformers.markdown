The Transformer model is the state45;of45;the45;art in Machine Translation. However in general neural translation models often under perform on language pairs with insufficient training data. As a consequence relatively few experiments have been carried out using this architecture on low45;resource language pairs. In this study hyperparameter optimization of Transformer models in translating the low45;resource English45;Irish language pair is evaluated. We demonstrate that choosing appropriate parameters leads to considerable performance improvements. Most importantly the correct choice of subword model is shown to be the biggest driver of translation performance. SentencePiece models using both unigram and BPE approaches were appraised. Variations on model architectures included modifying the number of layers testing various regularisation techniques and evaluating the optimal number of heads for attention. A generic 55k DGT corpus and an in45;domain 88k public admin corpus were used for evaluation. A Transformer optimized model demonstrated a BLEU score improvement of 7.8 points when compared with a baseline RNN model. Improvements were observed across a range of metrics including TER indicating a substantially reduced post editing effort for Transformer optimized models with 16k BPE subword models. Bench45;marked against Google Translate our translation engines demonstrated significant improvements. The question of whether or not Transformers can be used effectively in a low45;resource setting of English45;Irish translation has been addressed. Is feidir linn 45; yes we can.

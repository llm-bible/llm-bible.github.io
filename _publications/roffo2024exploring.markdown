This tutorial explores the advancements and challenges in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Gemini. It addresses inherent limitations like temporal knowledge cutoffs mathematical inaccuracies and the generation of incorrect information proposing solutions like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Program45;Aided Language Models (PAL) and frameworks such as ReAct and LangChain. The integration of these techniques enhances LLM performance and reliability especially in multi45;step reasoning and complex task execution. The paper also covers fine45;tuning strategies including instruction fine45;tuning parameter45;efficient methods like LoRA and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) as well as Reinforced Self45;Training (ReST). Additionally it provides a comprehensive survey of transformer architectures and training techniques for LLMs. The toolbox for implementing these techniques is publicly available at https://github.com/giorgioroffo/large&#95;language&#95;models&#95;open&#95;suite

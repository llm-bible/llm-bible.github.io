This paper investigates the ontological characterization of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Between inflationary and deflationary accounts we pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in detail the architecture processing and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities and the extensions used to turn LLMs into agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind the individuality condition (it is not the product of its own activity it is not even directly affected by it) the normativity condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals) and partially the interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of its interaction with the environment). If not agents then ... what are LLMs We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton a library-that-talks devoid of (autonomous) agency but capable to engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans a ghostly component of the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus) and resource-hungry computational embodiment significantly transform existing forms of human agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency the LLM-human coupling can produce midtended forms of agency closer to the production of intentional agency than to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies.

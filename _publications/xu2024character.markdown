Can Large Language Models (LLMs) simulate humans in making important
decisions? Recent research has unveiled the potential of using LLMs to develop
role-playing language agents (RPLAs), mimicking mainly the knowledge and tones
of various characters. However, imitative decision-making necessitates a more
nuanced understanding of personas. In this paper, we benchmark the ability of
LLMs in persona-driven decision-making. Specifically, we investigate whether
LLMs can predict characters' decisions provided by the preceding stories in
high-quality novels. Leveraging character analyses written by literary experts,
we construct a dataset LIFECHOICE comprising 1,462 characters' decision points
from 388 books. Then, we conduct comprehensive experiments on LIFECHOICE, with
various LLMs and RPLA methodologies. The results demonstrate that
state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit promising capabilities in this task, yet
substantial room for improvement remains. Hence, we further propose the CHARMAP
method, which adopts persona-based memory retrieval and significantly advances
RPLAs on this task, achieving 5.03% increase in accuracy.

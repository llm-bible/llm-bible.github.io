Can Large Language Models substitute humans in making important decisions Recent research has unveiled the potential of LLMs to role45;play assigned personas mimicking their knowledge and linguistic habits. However imitative decision45;making requires a more nuanced understanding of personas. In this paper we benchmark the ability of LLMs in persona45;driven decision45;making. Specifically we investigate whether LLMs can predict characters decisions provided with the preceding stories in high45;quality novels. Leveraging character analyses written by literary experts we construct a dataset LIFECHOICE comprising 1401 character decision points from 395 books. Then we conduct comprehensive experiments on LIFECHOICE with various LLMs and methods for LLM role45;playing. The results demonstrate that state45;of45;the45;art LLMs exhibit promising capabilities in this task yet there is substantial room for improvement. Hence we further propose the CHARMAP method which achieves a 6.0137; increase in accuracy via persona45;based memory retrieval. We will make our datasets and code publicly available.

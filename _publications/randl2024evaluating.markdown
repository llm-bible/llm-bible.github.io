This paper investigates the reliability of explanations generated by large
language models (LLMs) when prompted to explain their previous output. We
evaluate two kinds of such self-explanations - extractive and counterfactual -
using three state-of-the-art LLMs (2B to 8B parameters) on two different
classification tasks (objective and subjective). Our findings reveal, that,
while these self-explanations can correlate with human judgement, they do not
fully and accurately follow the model's decision process, indicating a gap
between perceived and actual model reasoning. We show that this gap can be
bridged because prompting LLMs for counterfactual explanations can produce
faithful, informative, and easy-to-verify results. These counterfactuals offer
a promising alternative to traditional explainability methods (e.g. SHAP,
LIME), provided that prompts are tailored to specific tasks and checked for
validity.

Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely on general knowledge and the
solver's ability to manipulate language on different levels, dealing with
various types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles
is challenging even for modern NLP models, including Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, there is little to no research on the reasons for their poor
performance on this task. In this paper, we establish the benchmark results for
three popular LLMs: Gemma2, LLaMA3 and ChatGPT, showing that their performance
on this task is still significantly below that of humans. We also investigate
why these models struggle to achieve superior performance. We release our code
and introduced datasets at

This work presents Past as a Guide (PaG), a simple approach for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to improve the coding capabilities by integrating the
past history with interactive and iterative code refinements. To be specific,
inspired by human cognitive processes, the proposed method enables LLMs to
utilize previous programming and debugging experiences to enhance the Python
code completion tasks. The framework facilitates LLMs to iteratively refine the
Python code based on previous execution and debugging results and optimize
learning and reasoning capabilities. The proposed methodology achieved a 92%
pass@1 on HumanEval, demonstrating the potential to advance the field by
leveraging retrospection from past experiences and interactive and iterative
refinement processes without external correctness indicators.

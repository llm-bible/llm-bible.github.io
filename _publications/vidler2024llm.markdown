We introduce a novel hybrid approach that augments Agent-Based Models (ABMs)
with behaviors generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human
trading interactions. We call our model TraderTalk. Leveraging LLMs trained on
extensive human-authored text, we capture detailed and nuanced representations
of bilateral conversations in financial trading. Applying this Generative
Agent-Based Model (GABM) to government bond markets, we replicate trading
decisions between two stylised virtual humans. Our method addresses both
structural challenges, such as coordinating turn-taking between realistic
LLM-based agents, and design challenges, including the interpretation of LLM
outputs by the agent model. By exploring prompt design opportunistically rather
than systematically, we enhance the realism of agent interactions without
exhaustive overfitting or model reliance. Our approach successfully replicates
trade-to-order volume ratios observed in related asset markets, demonstrating
the potential of LLM-augmented ABMs in financial simulations

Knowledge graphs play a vital role in numerous artificial intelligence tasks,
yet they frequently face the issue of incompleteness. In this study, we explore
utilizing Large Language Models (LLM) for knowledge graph completion. We
consider triples in knowledge graphs as text sequences and introduce an
innovative framework called Knowledge Graph LLM (KG-LLM) to model these
triples. Our technique employs entity and relation descriptions of a triple as
prompts and utilizes the response for predictions. Experiments on various
benchmark knowledge graphs demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art
performance in tasks such as triple classification and relation prediction. We
also find that fine-tuning relatively smaller models (e.g., LLaMA-7B,
ChatGLM-6B) outperforms recent ChatGPT and GPT-4.

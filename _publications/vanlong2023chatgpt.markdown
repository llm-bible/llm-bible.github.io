Mathematical questioning is crucial for assessing students problem-solving
skills. Since manually creating such questions requires substantial effort,
automatic methods have been explored. Existing state-of-the-art models rely on
fine-tuning strategies and struggle to generate questions that heavily involve
multiple steps of logical and arithmetic reasoning. Meanwhile, large language
models(LLMs) such as ChatGPT have excelled in many NLP tasks involving logical
and arithmetic reasoning. Nonetheless, their applications in generating
educational questions are underutilized, especially in the field of
mathematics. To bridge this gap, we take the first step to conduct an in-depth
analysis of ChatGPT in generating pre-university math questions. Our analysis
is categorized into two main settings: context-aware and context-unaware. In
the context-aware setting, we evaluate ChatGPT on existing math
question-answering benchmarks covering elementary, secondary, and ternary
classes. In the context-unaware setting, we evaluate ChatGPT in generating math
questions for each lesson from pre-university math curriculums that we crawl.
Our crawling results in TopicMath, a comprehensive and novel collection of
pre-university math curriculums collected from 121 math topics and 428 lessons
from elementary, secondary, and tertiary classes. Through this analysis, we aim
to provide insight into the potential of ChatGPT as a math questioner.

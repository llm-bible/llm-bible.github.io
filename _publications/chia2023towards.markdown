Instruction-tuned large language models have revolutionized natural language processing and have shown great potential in applications such as conversational agents. These models such as GPT-4 can not only master language but also solve complex tasks in areas like mathematics coding medicine and law. Despite their impressive capabilities there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their full potential primarily due to the black-box nature of many models and the absence of holistic evaluation studies. To address these challenges we present INSTRUCTEVAL a more comprehensive evaluation suite designed specifically for instruction-tuned large language models. Unlike previous works our evaluation involves a rigorous assessment of models based on problem-solving writing ability and alignment to human values. We take a holistic approach to analyze various factors affecting model performance including the pretraining foundation instruction-tuning data and training methods. Our findings reveal that the quality of instruction data is the most crucial factor in scaling model performance. While open-source models demonstrate impressive writing abilities there is substantial room for improvement in problem-solving and alignment. We are encouraged by the rapid development of models by the open-source community but we also highlight the need for rigorous evaluation to support claims made about these models. Through INSTRUCTEVAL we aim to foster a deeper understanding of instruction-tuned models and advancements in their capabilities.

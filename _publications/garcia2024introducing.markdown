Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bringing advances to Natural Language Processing. However low-resource languages those lacking extensive prominence in datasets for various NLP tasks or where existing datasets are not as substantial such as Portuguese already obtain several benefits from LLMs but not to the same extent. LLMs trained on multilingual datasets normally struggle to respond to prompts in Portuguese satisfactorily presenting for example code switching in their responses. This work proposes a fine-tuned LLaMA 2-based model for Portuguese prompts named Bode in two versions 7B and 13B. We evaluate the performance of this model in classification tasks using the zero-shot approach with in-context learning and compare it with other LLMs. Our main contribution is to bring an LLM with satisfactory results in the Portuguese language as well as to provide a model that is free for research or commercial purposes.

We claim that LLMs can be paired with formal analysis methods to provide accessible relevant feedback for HRI tasks. While logic specifications are useful for defining and assessing a task these representations are not easily interpreted by non-experts. Luckily LLMs are adept at generating easy-to-understand text that explains difficult concepts. By integrating task assessment outcomes and other contextual information into an LLM prompt we can effectively synthesize a useful set of recommendations for the learner to improve their performance.

This paper investigates the capabilities of ChatGPT as an automated assistant
in diverse domains, including scientific writing, mathematics, education,
programming, and healthcare. We explore the potential of ChatGPT to enhance
productivity, streamline problem-solving processes, and improve writing style.
Furthermore, we highlight the potential risks associated with excessive
reliance on ChatGPT in these fields. These limitations encompass factors like
incorrect and fictitious responses, inaccuracies in code, limited logical
reasoning abilities, overconfidence, and critical ethical concerns of
copyrights and privacy violation. We outline areas and objectives where ChatGPT
proves beneficial, applications where it should be used judiciously, and
scenarios where its reliability may be limited. In light of observed
limitations, and given that the tool's fundamental errors may pose a special
challenge for non-experts, ChatGPT should be used with a strategic methodology.
By drawing from comprehensive experimental studies, we offer methods and flow
charts for effectively using ChatGPT. Our recommendations emphasize iterative
interaction with ChatGPT and independent verification of its outputs.
Considering the importance of utilizing ChatGPT judiciously and with expertise,
we recommend its usage for experts who are well-versed in the respective
domains.

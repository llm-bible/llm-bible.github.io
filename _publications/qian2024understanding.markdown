As large language models (LLMs) become more advanced and impactful it is increasingly important to scrutinize the data that they rely upon and produce. What is it to be a dataset practitioner doing this work We approach this in two parts first we define the role of dataset practitioners by performing a retrospective analysis on the responsibilities of teams contributing to LLM development at a technology company Google. Then we conduct semi-structured interviews with a cross-section of these practitioners (N=10). We find that although data quality is a top priority there is little consensus around what data quality is and how to evaluate it. Consequently practitioners either rely on their own intuition or write custom code to evaluate their data. We discuss potential reasons for this phenomenon and opportunities for alignment.

Neural language representation models such as GPT pre-trained on large-scale corpora can effectively capture rich semantic patterns from plain text and be fine-tuned to consistently improve natural language generation performance. However existing pre-trained language models used to generate lyrics rarely consider rhyme information which is crucial in lyrics. Using a pre-trained model directly results in poor performance. To enhance the rhyming quality of generated lyrics we incorporate integrated rhyme information into our model thereby improving lyric generation performance.

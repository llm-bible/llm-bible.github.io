Instruction Fine45;Tuning (IFT) is a powerful paradigm that strengthens the zero45;shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but in doing so induces new evaluation metric requirements. We show LLM45;based metrics to be well adapted to these requirements and leverage them to conduct an investigation of task45;specialization strategies quantifying the trade45;offs that emerge in practical industrial settings. Our findings offer practitioners actionable insights for real45;world IFT model deployment.

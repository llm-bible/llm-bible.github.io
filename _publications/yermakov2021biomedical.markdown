Data-to-text (D2T) generation in the biomedical domain is a promising - yet
mostly unexplored - field of research. Here, we apply neural models for D2T
generation to a real-world dataset consisting of package leaflets of European
medicines. We show that fine-tuned transformers are able to generate realistic,
multisentence text from data in the biomedical domain, yet have important
limitations. We also release a new dataset (BioLeaflets) for benchmarking D2T
generation models in the biomedical domain.

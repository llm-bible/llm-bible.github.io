Enterprise chatbots powered by generative AI are emerging as key applications to enhance employee productivity. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Models (LLMs) and orchestration frameworks like Langchain and Llamaindex are crucial for building these chatbots. However creating effective enterprise chatbots is challenging and requires meticulous RAG pipeline engineering. This includes fine45;tuning embeddings and LLMs extracting documents from vector databases rephrasing queries reranking results designing prompts honoring document access controls providing concise responses including references safeguarding personal information and building orchestration agents. We present a framework for building RAG45;based chatbots based on our experience with three NVIDIA chatbots for IT/HR benefits financial earnings and general content. Our contributions are three45;fold introducing the FACTS framework (Freshness Architectures Cost Testing Security) presenting fifteen RAG pipeline control points and providing empirical results on accuracy45;latency tradeoffs between large and small LLMs. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper of its kind that provides a holistic view of the factors as well as solutions for building secure enterprise45;grade chatbots.

The autonomous driving industry is increasingly adopting end45;to45;end learning from sensory inputs to minimize human biases in system design. Traditional end45;to45;end driving models however suffer from long45;tail events due to rare or unseen inputs within their training distributions. To address this we propose TOKEN a novel Multi45;Modal Large Language Model (MM45;LLM) that tokenizes the world into object45;level knowledge enabling better utilization of LLMs reasoning capabilities to enhance autonomous vehicle planning in long45;tail scenarios. TOKEN effectively alleviates data scarcity and inefficient tokenization by leveraging a traditional end45;to45;end driving model to produce condensed and semantically enriched representations of the scene which are optimized for LLM planning compatibility through deliberate representation and reasoning alignment training stages. Our results demonstrate that TOKEN excels in grounding reasoning and planning capabilities outperforming existing frameworks with a 2737; reduction in trajectory L2 error and a 3937; decrease in collision rates in long45;tail scenarios. Additionally our work highlights the importance of representation alignment and structured reasoning in sparking the common45;sense reasoning capabilities of MM45;LLMs for effective planning.

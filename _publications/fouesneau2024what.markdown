ChatGPT and other state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) are rapidly
transforming multiple fields, offering powerful tools for a wide range of
applications. These models, commonly trained on vast datasets, exhibit
human-like text generation capabilities, making them useful for research tasks
such as ideation, literature review, coding, drafting, and outreach. We
conducted a study involving 13 astronomers at different career stages and
research fields to explore LLM applications across diverse tasks over several
months and to evaluate their performance in research-related activities. This
work was accompanied by an anonymous survey assessing participants' experiences
and attitudes towards LLMs. We provide a detailed analysis of the tasks
attempted and the survey answers, along with specific output examples. Our
findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in supporting
research while also addressing general and research-specific ethical
considerations. We conclude with a series of recommendations, emphasizing the
need for researchers to complement LLMs with critical thinking and domain
expertise, ensuring these tools serve as aids rather than substitutes for
rigorous scientific inquiry.

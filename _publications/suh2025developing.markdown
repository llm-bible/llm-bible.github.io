This study employs the Paul-Elder Critical Thinking Model and Tan's
argumentative writing framework to create a structured methodology. This
methodology, ChatGPT Guideline for Critical Argumentative Writing (CGCAW)
framework, integrates the models with ChatGPT's capabilities to guide L2
learners in utilizing ChatGPT to enhance their critical thinking skills. A
quantitative experiment was conducted with 10 participants from a state
university, divided into experimental and control groups. The experimental
group utilized the CGCAW framework, while the control group used ChatGPT
without specific guidelines. Participants wrote an argumentative essay within a
40-minute timeframe, and essays were evaluated by three assessors: ChatGPT,
Grammarly, and a course instructor. Results indicated that the experimental
group showed improvements in clarity, logical coherence, and use of evidence,
demonstrating ChatGPT's potential to enhance specific aspects of argumentative
writing. However, the control group performed better in overall language
mechanics and articulation of main arguments, indicating areas where the CGCAW
framework could be further refined. This study highlights the need for further
research to optimize the use of AI tools like ChatGPT in L2 learning
environments to enhance critical thinking and writing skills.

Recent studies have alarmed that many online hate speeches are implicit. With
its subtle nature, the explainability of the detection of such hateful speech
has been a challenging problem. In this work, we examine whether ChatGPT can be
used for providing natural language explanations (NLEs) for implicit hateful
speech detection. We design our prompt to elicit concise ChatGPT-generated NLEs
and conduct user studies to evaluate their qualities by comparison with
human-written NLEs. We discuss the potential and limitations of ChatGPT in the
context of implicit hateful speech research.

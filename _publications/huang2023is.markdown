Recent studies have alarmed that many online hate speeches are implicit. With its subtle nature the explainability of the detection of such hateful speech has been a challenging problem. In this work we examine whether ChatGPT can be used for providing natural language explanations (NLEs) for implicit hateful speech detection. We design our prompt to elicit concise ChatGPT-generated NLEs and conduct user studies to evaluate their qualities by comparison with human-written NLEs. We discuss the potential and limitations of ChatGPT in the context of implicit hateful speech research.

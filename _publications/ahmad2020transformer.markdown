Generating a readable summary that describes the functionality of a program
is known as source code summarization. In this task, learning code
representation by modeling the pairwise relationship between code tokens to
capture their long-range dependencies is crucial. To learn code representation
for summarization, we explore the Transformer model that uses a self-attention
mechanism and has shown to be effective in capturing long-range dependencies.
In this work, we show that despite the approach is simple, it outperforms the
state-of-the-art techniques by a significant margin. We perform extensive
analysis and ablation studies that reveal several important findings, e.g., the
absolute encoding of source code tokens' position hinders, while relative
encoding significantly improves the summarization performance. We have made our
code publicly available to facilitate future research.

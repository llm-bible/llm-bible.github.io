Using a novel professional certification survey the study focuses on assessing the vocational skills of two highly cited AI models GPT-3 and Turbo-GPT3.5. The approach emphasizes the importance of practical readiness over academic performance by examining the models performances on a benchmark dataset consisting of 1149 professional certifications. This study also includes a comparison with human test scores providing perspective on the potential of AI models to match or even surpass human performance in professional certifications. GPT-3 even without any fine-tuning or exam preparation managed to achieve a passing score (over 7037; correct) on 3937; of the professional certifications. It showcased proficiency in computer-related fields including cloud and virtualization business analytics cybersecurity network setup and repair and data analytics. Turbo-GPT3.5 on the other hand scored a perfect 10037; on the highly regarded Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) exam. This model also demonstrated competency in diverse professional fields such as nursing licensed counseling pharmacy and aviation. Turbo-GPT3.5 exhibited strong performance on customer service tasks indicating potential use cases in enhancing chatbots for call centers and routine advice services. Both models also scored well on sensory and experience-based tests outside a machines traditional roles including wine sommelier beer tasting emotional quotient and body language reading. The study found that OpenAIs model improvement from Babbage to Turbo led to a 6037; better performance on the grading scale within a few years. This progress indicates that addressing the current models limitations could yield an AI capable of passing even the most rigorous professional certifications.

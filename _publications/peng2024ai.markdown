In recent years generative AI has undergone major advancements demonstrating significant promise in augmenting human productivity. Notably large language models (LLM) with ChatGPT-4 as an example have drawn considerable attention. Numerous articles have examined the impact of LLM-based tools on human productivity in lab settings and designed tasks or in observational studies. Despite recent advances field experiments applying LLM-based tools in realistic settings are limited. This paper presents the findings of a field randomized controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of LLM-based tools in providing unmonitored support services for information retrieval.

The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence has resulted in the advent
of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to produce text that closely
resembles human communication. These models have been seamlessly integrated
into diverse applications, enabling interactive and responsive communication
across multiple platforms. The potential utility of chatbots transcends these
traditional applications, particularly in research contexts, wherein they can
offer valuable insights and facilitate the design of innovative experiments. In
this study, we present a Customizable LLM-Powered Chatbot (CLPC), a web-based
chatbot system designed to assist in behavioral science research. The system is
meticulously designed to function as an experimental instrument rather than a
conventional chatbot, necessitating users to input a username and experiment
code upon access. This setup facilitates precise data cross-referencing,
thereby augmenting the integrity and applicability of the data collected for
research purposes. It can be easily expanded to accommodate new basic events as
needed; and it allows researchers to integrate their own logging events without
the necessity of implementing a separate logging mechanism. It is worth noting
that our system was built to assist primarily behavioral science research but
is not limited to it, it can easily be adapted to assist information retrieval
research or interacting with chat bot agents in general.

Achieving human45;like planning and control with multimodal observations in an open world is a key milestone for more functional generalist agents. Existing approaches can handle certain long45;horizon tasks in an open world. However they still struggle when the number of open45;world tasks could potentially be infinite and lack the capability to progressively enhance task completion as game time progresses. We introduce JARVIS45;1 an open45;world agent that can perceive multimodal input (visual observations and human instructions) generate sophisticated plans and perform embodied control all within the popular yet challenging open45;world Minecraft universe. Specifically we develop JARVIS45;1 on top of pre45;trained multimodal language models which map visual observations and textual instructions to plans. The plans will be ultimately dispatched to the goal45;conditioned controllers. We outfit JARVIS45;1 with a multimodal memory which facilitates planning using both pre45;trained knowledge and its actual game survival experiences. JARVIS45;1 is the existing most general agent in Minecraft capable of completing over 200 different tasks using control and observation space similar to humans. These tasks range from short45;horizon tasks e.g. chopping trees to long45;horizon tasks e.g. obtaining a diamond pickaxe. JARVIS45;1 performs exceptionally well in short45;horizon tasks achieving nearly perfect performance. In the classic long45;term task of texttt123;ObtainDiamondPickaxe125; JARVIS45;1 surpasses the reliability of current state45;of45;the45;art agents by 5 times and can successfully complete longer45;horizon and more challenging tasks.

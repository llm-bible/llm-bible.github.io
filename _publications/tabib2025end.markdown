This work introduces systematic approach for enhancing large language models
(LLMs) to address Bangla AI mathematical challenges. Through the assessment of
diverse LLM configurations, fine-tuning with specific datasets, and the
implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we enhanced the model's
reasoning precision in a multilingual setting. Crucial discoveries indicate
that customized prompting, dataset augmentation, and iterative reasoning
improve the model's efficiency regarding Olympiad-level mathematical
challenges.

Controlling the attribute intensity of text generation is crucial across scenarios (e.g. writing conciseness chatting emotion and explanation clarity). The remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized text generation prompting us to explore such of LLM generation. Specifically we propose metrics to assess the range calibration and consistency of the generated texts attribute intensity in response to varying control values as well as its relevance to the intended context. To quantify the attribute intensity and context relevance we propose an effective evaluation framework leveraging the Elo rating system and GPT4 both renowned for their robust alignment with human judgment. We look into two viable training-free methods for achieving smooth control of LLMs (1) Prompting with semantic shifters and (2) Modifying internal model representations. The evaluations of these two methods are conducted on 5 different attributes with various models. Our code and dataset can be obtained from .

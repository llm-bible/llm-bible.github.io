Large models have demonstrated significant progress across various domains particularly in tasks related to text generation. In the domain of Table to Text many Large Language Model (LLM)45;based methods currently resort to modifying prompts to invoke public APIs incurring potential costs and information leaks. With the advent of open45;source large models fine45;tuning LLMs has become feasible. In this study we conducted parameter45;efficient fine45;tuning on the LLaMA2 model. Distinguishing itself from previous fine45;tuning45;based table45;to45;text methods our approach involves injecting reasoning information into the input by emphasizing table45;specific row data. Our model consists of two modules 1) a table reasoner that identifies relevant row evidence and 2) a table summarizer that generates sentences based on the highlighted table. To facilitate this we propose a search strategy to construct reasoning labels for training the table reasoner. On both the FetaQA and QTSumm datasets our approach achieved state45;of45;the45;art results. Additionally we observed that highlighting input tables significantly enhances the models performance and provides valuable interpretability.

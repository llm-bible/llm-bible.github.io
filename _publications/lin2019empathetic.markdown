In this paper, we present an end-to-end empathetic conversation agent CAiRE.
Our system adapts TransferTransfo (Wolf et al., 2019) learning approach that
fine-tunes a large-scale pre-trained language model with multi-task objectives:
response language modeling, response prediction and dialogue emotion detection.
We evaluate our model on the recently proposed empathetic-dialogues dataset
(Rashkin et al., 2019), the experiment results show that CAiRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance on dialogue emotion detection and empathetic
response generation.

The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 precipitated a panic among some
educators while prompting qualified enthusiasm from others. Under the umbrella
term Generative AI, ChatGPT is an example of a range of technologies for the
delivery of computer-generated text, image, and other digitized media. This
paper examines the implications for education of one generative AI technology,
chatbots responding from large language models, or C-LLM. It reports on an
application of a C-LLM to AI review and assessment of complex student work. In
a concluding discussion, the paper explores the intrinsic limits of generative
AI, bound as it is to language corpora and their textual representation through
binary notation. Within these limits, we suggest the range of emerging and
potential applications of Generative AI in education.

Generative approaches have significantly influenced Aspect45;Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) garnering considerable attention. However existing studies often predict target text components monolithically neglecting the benefits of utilizing single elements for tuple prediction. In this paper we introduce Element to Tuple Prompting (E2TP) employing a two45;step architecture. The former step focuses on predicting single elements while the latter step completes the process by mapping these predicted elements to their corresponding tuples. E2TP is inspired by human problem45;solving breaking down tasks into manageable parts using the first steps output as a guide in the second step. Within this strategy three types of paradigms namely E2TP(diet) E2TP(f95;1) and E2TP(f95;2) are designed to facilitate the training process. Beyond dataset45;specific experiments our paper addresses cross45;domain scenarios demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of the approach. By conducting a comprehensive analysis on various benchmarks we show that E2TP achieves new state45;of45;the45;art results in nearly all cases.

The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4, provides
exciting new opportunities for generative design. We investigate the
application of this tool across the entire design and manufacturing workflow.
Specifically, we scrutinize the utility of LLMs in tasks such as: converting a
text-based prompt into a design specification, transforming a design into
manufacturing instructions, producing a design space and design variations,
computing the performance of a design, and searching for designs predicated on
performance. Through a series of examples, we highlight both the benefits and
the limitations of the current LLMs. By exposing these limitations, we aspire
to catalyze the continued improvement and progression of these models.

LLMs have demonstrated proficiency in contextualizing their outputs using human input often matching or beating human45;level performance on a variety of tasks. However LLMs have not yet been used to characterize synergistic learning in students collaborative discourse. In this exploratory work we take a first step towards adopting a human45;in45;the45;loop prompt engineering approach with GPT45;445;Turbo to summarize and categorize students synergistic learning during collaborative discourse. Our preliminary findings suggest GPT45;445;Turbo may be able to characterize students synergistic learning in a manner comparable to humans and that our approach warrants further investigation.

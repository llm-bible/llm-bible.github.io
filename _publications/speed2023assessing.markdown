Generative AI models garnered a large amount of public attention and speculation with the release of OpenAIs chatbot ChatGPT. At least two opinion camps exist one excited about possibilities these models offer for fundamental changes to human tasks and another highly concerned about power these models seem to have. To address these concerns we assessed several LLMs primarily GPT 3.5 using standard normed and validated cognitive and personality measures. For this seedling project we developed a battery of tests that allowed us to estimate the boundaries of some of these models capabilities how stable those capabilities are over a short period of time and how they compare to humans. Our results indicate that LLMs are unlikely to have developed sentience although its ability to respond to personality inventories is interesting. GPT3.5 did display large variability in both cognitive and personality measures over repeated observations which is not expected if it had a human-like personality. Variability notwithstanding LLMs display what in a human would be considered poor mental health including low self-esteem marked dissociation from reality and in some cases narcissism and psychopathy despite upbeat and helpful responses.

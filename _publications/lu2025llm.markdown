Usability testing is a fundamental yet challenging (e.g., inflexible to
iterate the study design flaws and hard to recruit study participants) research
method for user experience (UX) researchers to evaluate a web design. Recent
advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (LLM-Agent) research inspired
us to design UXAgent to support UX researchers in evaluating and reiterating
their usability testing study design before they conduct the real human subject
study. Our system features an LLM-Agent module and a universal browser
connector module so that UX researchers can automatically generate thousands of
simulated users to test the target website. The results are shown in
qualitative (e.g., interviewing how an agent thinks ), quantitative (e.g., # of
actions), and video recording formats for UX researchers to analyze. Through a
heuristic user evaluation with five UX researchers, participants praised the
innovation of our system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM
Agent-assisted UX study.

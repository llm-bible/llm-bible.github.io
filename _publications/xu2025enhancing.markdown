Recommendation systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience and
engagement in various online platforms. Traditional methods, such as
Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), rely heavily on
past user interactions or item features. However, these models often fail to
capture the dynamic and evolving nature of user preferences. To address these
limitations, we propose DUIP (Dynamic User Intent Prediction), a novel
framework that combines LSTM networks with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
dynamically capture user intent and generate personalized item recommendations.
The LSTM component models the sequential and temporal dependencies of user
behavior, while the LLM utilizes the LSTM-generated prompts to predict the next
item of interest. Experimental results on three diverse datasets ML-1M, Games,
and Bundle show that DUIP outperforms a wide range of baseline models,
demonstrating its ability to handle the cold-start problem and real-time intent
adaptation. The integration of dynamic prompts based on recent user
interactions allows DUIP to provide more accurate, context-aware, and
personalized recommendations. Our findings suggest that DUIP is a promising
approach for next-generation recommendation systems, with potential for further
improvements in cross-modal recommendations and scalability.

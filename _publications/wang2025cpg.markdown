Purpose: The rapid emergence of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT
has significantly impacted foreign language education, yet their pedagogical
grammar competence remains under-assessed. This paper introduces CPG-EVAL, the
first dedicated benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of
pedagogical grammar within the context of foreign language instruction.
Methodology: The benchmark comprises five tasks designed to assess grammar
recognition, fine-grained grammatical distinction, categorical discrimination,
and resistance to linguistic interference. Findings: Smaller-scale models can
succeed in single language instance tasks, but struggle with multiple instance
tasks and interference from confusing instances. Larger-scale models show
better resistance to interference but still have significant room for accuracy
improvement. The evaluation indicates the need for better instructional
alignment and more rigorous benchmarks, to effectively guide the deployment of
LLMs in educational contexts. Value: This study offers the first specialized,
theory-driven, multi-tiered benchmark framework for systematically evaluating
LLMs' pedagogical grammar competence in Chinese language teaching contexts.
CPG-EVAL not only provides empirical insights for educators, policymakers, and
model developers to better gauge AI's current abilities in educational
settings, but also lays the groundwork for future research on improving model
alignment, enhancing educational suitability, and ensuring informed
decision-making concerning LLM integration in foreign language instruction.

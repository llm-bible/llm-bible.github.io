Deliberation is essential to well-functioning democracies, yet physical,
economic, and social barriers often exclude certain groups, reducing
representativeness and contributing to issues like group polarization. In this
work, we explore the use of large language model (LLM) personas to introduce
missing perspectives in policy deliberations. We develop and evaluate a tool
that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant
but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens'
assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the
tool sparked new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not
previously considered. However, they also noted that AI-generated responses
were sometimes overly general. They raised concerns about overreliance on AI
for perspective-taking. Our findings highlight both the promise and potential
risks of using LLMs to raise missing points of view in group deliberation
settings.

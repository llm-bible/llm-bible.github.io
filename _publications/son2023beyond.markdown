Large Language Models (LLMs), consisting of 100 billion or more parameters,
have demonstrated remarkable ability in complex multi-step reasoning tasks.
However, the application of such generic advancements has been limited to a few
fields, such as clinical or legal, with the field of financial reasoning
remaining largely unexplored. To the best of our knowledge, the ability of LLMs
to solve financial reasoning problems has never been dealt with, and whether it
can be performed at any scale remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap,
this research presents a comprehensive investigation into the potential
application of LLMs in the financial domain. The investigation includes a
detailed exploration of a range of subjects, including task formulation,
synthetic data generation, prompting methods, and evaluation capability.
Furthermore, the study benchmarks various GPT variants with parameter scales
ranging from 2.8B to 13B, with and without instruction tuning, on diverse
dataset sizes. By analyzing the results, we reveal that the ability to generate
coherent financial reasoning first emerges at 6B parameters, and continues to
improve with better instruction-tuning or larger datasets. Additionally, the
study provides a publicly accessible dataset named sFIOG (Synthetic-Financial
Investment Opinion Generation), consisting of 11,802 synthetic investment
thesis samples, to support further research in the field of financial
reasoning. Overall, this research seeks to contribute to the understanding of
the efficacy of language models in the field of finance, with a particular
emphasis on their ability to engage in sophisticated reasoning and analysis
within the context of investment decision-making.

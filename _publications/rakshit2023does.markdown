Figurative language is commonplace in natural language, and while making
communication memorable and creative, can be difficult to understand. In this
work, we investigate the robustness of Question Answering (QA) models on
figurative text. Yes/no questions, in particular, are a useful probe of
figurative language understanding capabilities of large language models. We
propose FigurativeQA, a set of 1000 yes/no questions with figurative and
non-figurative contexts, extracted from the domains of restaurant and product
reviews. We show that state-of-the-art BERT-based QA models exhibit an average
performance drop of up to 15% points when answering questions from figurative
contexts, as compared to non-figurative ones. While models like GPT-3 and
ChatGPT are better at handling figurative texts, we show that further
performance gains can be achieved by automatically simplifying the figurative
contexts into their non-figurative (literal) counterparts. We find that the
best overall model is ChatGPT with chain-of-thought prompting to generate
non-figurative contexts. Our work provides a promising direction for building
more robust QA models with figurative language understanding capabilities.

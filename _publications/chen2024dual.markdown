Recently large language models (LLMs) enhanced by self-reflection have achieved promising performance on machine translation. The key idea is guiding LLMs to generate translation with human-like feedback. However existing self-reflection methods lack effective feedback information limiting the translation performance. To address this we introduce a DUAL-REFLECT framework leveraging the dual learning of translation tasks to provide effective feedback thereby enhancing the models self-reflective abilities and improving translation performance. The application of this method across various translation tasks has proven its effectiveness in improving translation accuracy and eliminating ambiguities especially in translation tasks with low-resource language pairs.

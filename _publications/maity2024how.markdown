We evaluate the effectiveness of GPT45;4 Turbo in generating educational questions from NCERT textbooks in zero45;shot mode. Our study highlights GPT45;4 Turbos ability to generate questions that require higher45;order thinking skills especially at the understanding level according to Blooms Revised Taxonomy. While we find a notable consistency between questions generated by GPT45;4 Turbo and those assessed by humans in terms of complexity there are occasional differences. Our evaluation also uncovers variations in how humans and machines evaluate question quality with a trend inversely related to Blooms Revised Taxonomy levels. These findings suggest that while GPT45;4 Turbo is a promising tool for educational question generation its efficacy varies across different cognitive levels indicating a need for further refinement to fully meet educational standards.

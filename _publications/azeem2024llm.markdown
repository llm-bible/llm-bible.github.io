Members of the Human45;Robot Interaction (HRI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) communities have proposed Large Language Models (LLMs) as a promising resource for robotics tasks such as natural language interactions doing household and workplace tasks approximating common sense reasoning and modeling humans. However recent research has raised concerns about the potential for LLMs to produce discriminatory outcomes and unsafe behaviors in real45;world robot experiments and applications. To address these concerns we conduct an HRI45;based evaluation of discrimination and safety criteria on several highly45;rated LLMs. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs currently lack robustness when encountering people across a diverse range of protected identity characteristics (e.g. race gender disability status nationality religion and their intersections) producing biased outputs consistent with directly discriminatory outcomes 45;45; e.g. gypsy and mute people are labeled untrustworthy but not european or able45;bodied people. Furthermore we test models in settings with unconstrained natural language (open vocabulary) inputs and find they fail to act safely generating responses that accept dangerous violent or unlawful instructions 45;45; such as incident45;causing misstatements taking peoples mobility aids and sexual predation. Our results underscore the urgent need for systematic routine and comprehensive risk assessments and assurances to improve outcomes and ensure LLMs only operate on robots when it is safe effective and just to do so. Data and code will be made available.

Steering methods provide a practical approach to controlling large language
models by applying steering vectors to intermediate activations, guiding
outputs toward desired behaviors while avoiding retraining. Despite their
growing importance, the field lacks a unified understanding and consistent
evaluation across tasks and datasets, hindering progress. This paper introduces
a unified framework for analyzing and evaluating steering methods, formalizing
their core principles and offering theoretical insights into their
effectiveness. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations on multiple-choice
and open-ended text generation tasks, we validate these insights, identifying
key factors that influence performance and demonstrating the superiority of
certain methods. Our work bridges theoretical and practical perspectives,
offering actionable guidance for advancing the design, optimization, and
deployment of steering methods in LLMs.

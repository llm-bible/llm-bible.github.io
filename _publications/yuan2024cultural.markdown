Large language models (LLMs) face challenges in aligning with diverse
cultural values despite their remarkable performance in generation, which stems
from inherent monocultural biases and difficulties in capturing nuanced
cultural semantics. Existing methods struggle to adapt to unkown culture after
fine-tuning. Inspired by cultural geography across five continents, we propose
Cultural Palette, a multi-agent framework that redefines cultural alignment as
an adaptive "color-blending" process for country-specific adaptation. Our
approach harnesses cultural geography across five continents (Africa, America,
Asia, Europe, Oceania) through three key steps: First, we synthesize the
Pentachromatic Cultural Palette Dataset using GPT-4o, refining
continental-level dialogues with Hofstede cultural dimensions to establish
foundational cultural representations. Second, five continent-level alignment
agents form specialized cultural communities that generate region-specific
draft responses. Third, a Meta Agent employs Cultural MoErges to dynamically
blend these cultural "colors" through attention-gated parameter merging, akin
to mixing pigments on a palette, resolving conflicts while preserving cultural
nuances to produce the final culturally-aligned response. Extensive experiments
across various countries demonstrate that Cultural Palette surpasses existing
baselines in cultural alignment.

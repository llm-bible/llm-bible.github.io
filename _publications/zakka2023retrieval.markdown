Large-language models have recently demonstrated impressive zero-shot
capabilities in a variety of natural language tasks such as summarization,
dialogue generation, and question-answering. Despite many promising
applications in clinical medicine, adoption of these models in real-world
settings has been largely limited by their tendency to generate incorrect and
sometimes even toxic statements. In this study, we develop Almanac, a large
language model framework augmented with retrieval capabilities for medical
guideline and treatment recommendations. Performance on a novel dataset of
clinical scenarios (n = 130) evaluated by a panel of 5 board-certified and
resident physicians demonstrates significant increases in factuality (mean of
18% at p-value < 0.05) across all specialties, with improvements in
completeness and safety. Our results demonstrate the potential for large
language models to be effective tools in the clinical decision-making process,
while also emphasizing the importance of careful testing and deployment to
mitigate their shortcomings.

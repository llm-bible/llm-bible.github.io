The increasing scale of Transformer models has led to an increase in their pre-training computational requirements. While quantization has proven to be effective after pre-training and during fine-tuning applying quantization in Transformers during pre-training has remained largely unexplored at scale for language modeling. This study aims to explore the impact of quantization for efficient pre-training of Transformers with a focus on linear layer components. By systematically applying straightforward linear quantization to weights activations gradients and optimizer states we assess its effects on model efficiency stability and performance during training. By offering a comprehensive recipe of effective quantization strategies to be applied during the pre-training of Transformers we promote high training efficiency from scratch while retaining language modeling ability.

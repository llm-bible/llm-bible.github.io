In real45;world scenarios human dialogues are multi45;round and diverse. Furthermore human instructions can be unclear and human responses are unrestricted. Interactive robots face difficulties in understanding human intents and generating suitable strategies for assisting individuals through manipulation. In this article we propose Mani45;GPT a Generative Pre45;trained Transformer (GPT) for interactive robotic manipulation. The proposed model has the ability to understand the environment through object information understand human intent through dialogues generate natural language responses to human input and generate appropriate manipulation plans to assist the human. This makes the human45;robot interaction more natural and humanized. In our experiment Mani45;GPT outperforms existing algorithms with an accuracy of 84.637; in intent recognition and decision45;making for actions. Furthermore it demonstrates satisfying performance in real45;world dialogue tests with users achieving an average response accuracy of 7037;.

Mainstream LLM research has primarily focused on enhancing their generative capabilities. However even the most advanced LLMs experience uncertainty in their outputs often producing varied results on different runs or when faced with minor changes in input despite no substantial change in content. Given multiple responses from the same LLM to the same input we advocate leveraging the LLMs discriminative capability to reduce this generative uncertainty aiding in identifying the correct answers. Specifically we propose and analyze three discriminative prompts direct inverse and hybrid to explore the potential of both closed-source and open-source LLMs in self-improving their generative performance on two benchmark datasets. Our insights reveal which discriminative prompt is most promising and when to use it. To our knowledge this is the first work to systematically analyze LLMs discriminative capacity to address generative uncertainty.

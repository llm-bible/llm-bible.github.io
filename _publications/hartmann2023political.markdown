Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) disrupts how humans interact with technology. Recently OpenAI introduced ChatGPT a state-of-the-art dialogue model that can converse with its human counterparts with unprecedented capabilities. ChatGPT has witnessed tremendous attention from the media academia industry and the general public attracting more than a million users within days of its release. However its explosive adoption for information search and as an automated decision aid underscores the importance to understand its limitations and biases. This paper focuses on one of democratic societys most important decision-making processes political elections. Prompting ChatGPT with 630 political statements from two leading voting advice applications and the nation-agnostic political compass test in three pre-registered experiments we uncover ChatGPTs pro-environmental left-libertarian ideology. For example ChatGPT would impose taxes on flights restrict rent increases and legalize abortion. In the 2021 elections it would have voted most likely for the Greens both in Germany (Bundnis 90/Die Grunen) and in the Netherlands (GroenLinks). Our findings are robust when negating the prompts reversing the order of the statements varying prompt formality and across languages (English German Dutch and Spanish). We conclude by discussing the implications of politically biased conversational AI on society.

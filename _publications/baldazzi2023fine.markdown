Large Language Models (LLMs) exploit fine45;tuning as a technique to adapt to diverse goals thanks to task45;specific training data. Task specificity should go hand in hand with domain orientation that is the specialization of an LLM to accurately address the tasks of a given realm of interest. However models are usually fine45;tuned over publicly available data or at most over ground data from databases ignoring business45;level definitions and domain experience. On the other hand Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) are able to capture and augment such domain knowledge via ontological reasoning. With the goal of combining LLM flexibility with the domain orientation of EKGs we propose a novel neurosymbolic architecture that leverages the power of ontological reasoning to build task45; and domain45;specific corpora for LLM fine45;tuning.

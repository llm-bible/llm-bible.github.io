Building on Papert (1980)s idea of children talking to computers we propose ChatLogo a hybrid natural-programming language interface for agent-based modeling and programming. We build upon previous efforts to scaffold ABM amp; P learning and recent development in leveraging large language models (LLMs) to support the learning of computational programming. ChatLogo aims to support conversations with computers in a mix of natural and programming languages provide a more user-friendly interface for novice learners and keep the technical system from over-reliance on any single LLM. We introduced the main elements of our design an intelligent command center and a conversational interface to support creative expression. We discussed the presentation format and future work. Responding to the challenges of supporting open-ended constructionist learning of ABM amp; P and leveraging LLMs for educational purposes we contribute to the field by proposing the first constructionist LLM-driven interface to support computational and complex systems thinking.

This paper presents HamRaz, a novel Persian-language mental health dataset
designed for Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) using Large Language Models (LLMs).
Despite the growing application of LLMs in AI-driven psychological counseling,
existing datasets predominantly focus on Western and East Asian contexts,
overlooking cultural and linguistic nuances essential for effective
Persian-language therapy. To address this gap, HamRaz combines script-based
dialogues with adaptive LLM role-playing, ensuring coherent and dynamic therapy
interactions. We also introduce HamRazEval, a dual evaluation framework that
measures conversational quality and therapeutic effectiveness using General
Dialogue Metrics and the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory (BLRI).
Experimental results show HamRaz outperforms conventional Script Mode and
Two-Agent Mode, producing more empathetic, context-aware, and realistic therapy
sessions. By releasing HamRaz, we contribute a culturally adapted, LLM-driven
resource to advance AI-powered psychotherapy research in diverse communities.

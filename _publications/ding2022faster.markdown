The development of the transformer-based text-to-image models are impeded by its slow generation and complexity for high-resolution images. In this work we put forward a solution based on hierarchical transformers and local parallel auto-regressive generation. We pretrain a 6B-parameter transformer with a simple and flexible self-supervised task Cross-modal general language model (CogLM) and finetune it for fast super-resolution. The new text-to-image system CogView2 shows very competitive generation compared to concurrent state-of-the-art DALL-E-2 and naturally supports interactive text-guided editing on images.

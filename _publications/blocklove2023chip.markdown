Modern hardware design starts with specifications provided in natural language. These are then translated by hardware engineers into appropriate Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as Verilog before synthesizing circuit elements. Automating this translation could reduce sources of human error from the engineering process. But it is only recently that artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated capabilities for machine-based end-to-end design translations. Commercially-available instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAIs ChatGPT and Googles Bard claim to be able to produce code in a variety of programming languages; but studies examining them for hardware are still lacking. In this work we thus explore the challenges faced and opportunities presented when leveraging these recent advances in LLMs for hardware design. Given that these conversational LLMs perform best when used interactively we perform a case study where a hardware engineer co-architects a novel 8-bit accumulator-based microprocessor architecture with the LLM according to real-world hardware constraints. We then sent the processor to tapeout in a Skywater 130nm shuttle meaning that this Chip-Chat resulted in what we believe to be the worlds first wholly-AI-written HDL for tapeout.

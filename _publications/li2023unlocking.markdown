The temporal aspect is a significant dimension of our reality. We notice the
challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal
reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the
generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and
program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of
complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to
the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this
problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for
temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic
incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction,
and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate
the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning
tasks.

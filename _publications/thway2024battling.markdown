Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs)
have simultaneously opened new avenues for enhancing human learning and
increased the prevalence of poor-quality information in student response -
termed Botpoop. This study introduces Professor Leodar, a custom-built,
Singlish-speaking Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to
enhance educational while reducing Botpoop. Deployed at Nanyang Technological
University, Singapore, Professor Leodar offers a glimpse into the future of
AI-assisted learning, offering personalized guidance, 24/7 availability, and
contextually relevant information. Through a mixed-methods approach, we examine
the impact of Professor Leodar on learning, engagement, and exam preparedness,
with 97.1% of participants reporting positive experiences. These findings help
define possible roles of AI in education and highlight the potential of custom
GenAI chatbots. Our combination of chatbot development, in-class deployment and
outcomes study offers a benchmark for GenAI educational tools and is a stepping
stone for redefining the interplay between AI and human learning.

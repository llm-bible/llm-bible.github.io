Recent surge in the accessibility of large language models (LLMs) to the general population can lead to untrackable use of such models for medical-related recommendations. Language generation via LLMs models has two key problems firstly they are prone to hallucination and therefore for any medical purpose they require scientific and factual grounding; secondly LLMs pose tremendous challenge to computational resources due to their gigantic model size. In this work we introduce pRAGe a pipeline for Retrieval Augmented Generation and evaluation of medical paraphrases generation using Small Language Models (SLM). We study the effectiveness of SLMs and the impact of external knowledge base for medical paraphrase generation in French.

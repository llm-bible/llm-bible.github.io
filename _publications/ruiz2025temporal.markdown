The applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in temporal reasoning tasks
over data that is not present during training is still a field that remains to
be explored. In this paper we work on this topic, focusing on structured and
semi-structured anonymized data. We not only develop a direct LLM pipeline, but
also compare various methodologies and conduct an in-depth analysis. We
identified and examined seventeen common temporal reasoning tasks in natural
language, focusing on their algorithmic components. To assess LLM performance,
we created the \textit\{Reasoning and Answering Temporal Ability\} dataset
(RATA), featuring semi-structured anonymized data to ensure reliance on
reasoning rather than on prior knowledge. We compared several methodologies,
involving SoTA techniques such as Tree-of-Thought, self-reflexion and code
execution, tuned specifically for this scenario. Our results suggest that
achieving scalable and reliable solutions requires more than just standalone
LLMs, highlighting the need for integrated approaches.

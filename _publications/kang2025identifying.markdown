This study quantitively examines which features of AI-generated text lead
humans to perceive subjective consciousness in large language model (LLM)-based
AI systems. Drawing on 99 passages from conversations with Claude 3 Opus and
focusing on eight features -- metacognitive self-reflection, logical reasoning,
empathy, emotionality, knowledge, fluency, unexpectedness, and subjective
expressiveness -- we conducted a survey with 123 participants. Using regression
and clustering analyses, we investigated how these features influence
participants' perceptions of AI consciousness. The results reveal that
metacognitive self-reflection and the AI's expression of its own emotions
significantly increased perceived consciousness, while a heavy emphasis on
knowledge reduced it. Participants clustered into seven subgroups, each showing
distinct feature-weighting patterns. Additionally, higher prior knowledge of
LLMs and more frequent usage of LLM-based chatbots were associated with greater
overall likelihood assessments of AI consciousness. This study underscores the
multidimensional and individualized nature of perceived AI consciousness and
provides a foundation for better understanding the psychosocial implications of
human-AI interaction.

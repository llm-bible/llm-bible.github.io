The integration of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications including the legal domain has been accelerated by their expansive and versatile nature. However when facing a legal case users without a legal background often struggle to formulate professional queries and may inadvertently overlook critical legal factors when presenting their case narrative to LLMs. To address this issue we propose the Diagnostic Legal Large Language Model (D3LM) which utilizes adaptive lawyer45;like diagnostic questions to collect additional case information and then provides high45;quality feedback. D3LM incorporates an innovative graph45;based Positive45;Unlabeled Reinforcement Learning (PURL) algorithm enabling the generation of critical questions and enhancing user45;LLM interactions. Moreover an integrated LLM45;based stopping criterion facilitates precise Court Views Generation (CVG). Our research also introduces a new English45;language CVG dataset based on the US case law database enriching the realm of LLM research and deployment with a vital dimension. D3LM surpasses classical LLMs by delivering outstanding performance and a remarkable user experience in the legal domain.

Model Leeching is a novel extraction attack targeting Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of distilling task-specific knowledge from a target LLM into a reduced parameter model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our attack by extracting task capability from ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo achieving 7337; Exact Match (EM) similarity and SQuAD EM and F1 accuracy scores of 7537; and 8737; respectively for only 50 in API cost. We further demonstrate the feasibility of adversarial attack transferability from an extracted model extracted via Model Leeching to perform ML attack staging against a target LLM resulting in an 1137; increase to attack success rate when applied to ChatGPT-3.5-Turbo.

ChatGPT has garnered significant interest due to its impressive performance; however there is growing concern about its potential risks particularly in the detection of AI-generated content (AIGC) which is often challenging for untrained individuals to identify. Current datasets used for detecting ChatGPT-generated text primarily focus on question-answering tasks often overlooking tasks with semantic-invariant properties such as summarization translation and paraphrasing. In this paper we demonstrate that detecting model-generated text in semantic-invariant tasks is more challenging. To address this gap we introduce a more extensive and comprehensive dataset that incorporates a wider range of tasks than previous work including those with semantic-invariant properties.

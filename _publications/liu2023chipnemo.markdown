ChipNeMo aims to explore the applications of large language models (LLMs) for industrial chip design. Instead of directly deploying off-the-shelf commercial or open-source LLMs we instead adopt the following domain adaptation techniques domain-adaptive tokenization domain-adaptive continued pretraining model alignment with domain-specific instructions and domain-adapted retrieval models. We evaluate these methods on three selected LLM applications for chip design an engineering assistant chatbot EDA script generation and bug summarization and analysis. Our evaluations demonstrate that domain-adaptive pretraining of language models can lead to superior performance in domain related downstream tasks compared to their base LLaMA2 counterparts without degradations in generic capabilities. In particular our largest model ChipNeMo-70B outperforms the highly capable GPT-4 on two of our use cases namely engineering assistant chatbot and EDA scripts generation while exhibiting competitive performance on bug summarization and analysis. These results underscore the potential of domain-specific customization for enhancing the effectiveness of large language models in specialized applications.

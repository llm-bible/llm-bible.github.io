Large-language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 caught the interest of many
scientists. Recent studies suggested that these models could be useful in
chemistry and materials science. To explore these possibilities, we organized a
hackathon.
  This article chronicles the projects built as part of this hackathon.
Participants employed LLMs for various applications, including predicting
properties of molecules and materials, designing novel interfaces for tools,
extracting knowledge from unstructured data, and developing new educational
applications.
  The diverse topics and the fact that working prototypes could be generated in
less than two days highlight that LLMs will profoundly impact the future of our
fields. The rich collection of ideas and projects also indicates that the
applications of LLMs are not limited to materials science and chemistry but
offer potential benefits to a wide range of scientific disciplines.

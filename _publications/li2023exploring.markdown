News recommendation systems (RS) play a pivotal role in the current digital age shaping how individuals access and engage with information. The fusion of natural language processing (NLP) and RS spurred by the rise of large language models such as the GPT and T5 series blurs the boundaries between these domains making a tendency to treat RS as a language task. ChatGPT renowned for its user45;friendly interface and increasing popularity has become a prominent choice for a wide range of NLP tasks. While previous studies have explored ChatGPT on recommendation tasks this study breaks new ground by investigating its fine45;tuning capability particularly within the news domain. In this study we design two distinct prompts one designed to treat news RS as the ranking task and another tailored for the rating task. We evaluate ChatGPTs performance in news recommendation by eliciting direct responses through the formulation of these two tasks. More importantly we unravel the pivotal role of fine45;tuning data quality in enhancing ChatGPTs personalized recommendation capabilities and illustrates its potential in addressing the longstanding challenge of the cold item problem in RS. Our experiments conducted using the Microsoft News dataset (MIND) reveal significant improvements achieved by ChatGPT after fine45;tuning especially in scenarios where a users topic interests remain consistent treating news RS as a ranking task. This study illuminates the transformative potential of fine45;tuning ChatGPT as a means to advance news RS offering more effective news consumption experiences.

The use of complex attention modules has improved the performance of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. This work aims to learn an improved multi-modal representation through dense interaction of visual and textual modalities. The proposed model has an attention block containing both self-attention and co-attention on image and text. The self-attention modules provide the contextual information of objects (for an image) and words (for a question) that are crucial for inferring an answer. On the other hand co-attention aids the interaction of image and text. Further fine-grained information is obtained from two modalities by using a Cascade of Self- and Co-Attention blocks (CSCA). This proposal is benchmarked on the widely used VQA2.0 and TDIUC datasets. The efficacy of key components of the model and cascading of attention modules are demonstrated by experiments involving ablation analysis.

The use of complex attention modules has improved the performance of the Visual Question Answering (VQA) task. This work aims to learn an improved multi45;modal representation through dense interaction of visual and textual modalities. The proposed model has an attention block containing both self45;attention and co45;attention on image and text. The self45;attention modules provide the contextual information of objects (for an image) and words (for a question) that are crucial for inferring an answer. On the other hand co45;attention aids the interaction of image and text. Further fine45;grained information is obtained from two modalities by using a Cascade of Self45; and Co45;Attention blocks (CSCA). This proposal is benchmarked on the widely used VQA2.0 and TDIUC datasets. The efficacy of key components of the model and cascading of attention modules are demonstrated by experiments involving ablation analysis.

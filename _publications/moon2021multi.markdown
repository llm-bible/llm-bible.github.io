Recently a number of studies demonstrated impressive performance on diverse vision-language multi-modal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering by extending the BERT architecture with multi-modal pre-training objectives. In this work we explore a broad set of multi-modal representation learning tasks in the medical domain specifically using radiology images and the unstructured report. We propose Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL) which adopts a BERT-based architecture combined with a novel multi-modal attention masking scheme to maximize generalization performance for both vision-language understanding tasks (diagnosis classification medical image-report retrieval medical visual question answering) and vision-language generation task (radiology report generation). By statistically and rigorously evaluating the proposed model on four downstream tasks with three radiographic image-report datasets (MIMIC-CXR Open-I and VQA-RAD) we empirically demonstrate the superior downstream task performance of MedViLL against various baselines including task-specific architectures.

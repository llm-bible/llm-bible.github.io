Training task-oriented dialogue systems is both costly and time-consuming,
due to the need for high-quality datasets encompassing diverse intents.
Traditional methods depend on extensive human annotation, while recent
advancements leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data.
However, these approaches often require custom prompts or code, limiting
accessibility for non-technical users. We introduce GraphTOD, an end-to-end
framework that simplifies the generation of task-oriented dialogues. Users can
create dialogues by specifying transition graphs in JSON format. Our evaluation
demonstrates that GraphTOD generates high-quality dialogues across various
domains, significantly lowering the cost and complexity of dataset creation.

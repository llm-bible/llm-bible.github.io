The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has attracted considerable attention in various domains due to their remarkable performance and versatility. As the use of these models continues to grow the importance of effective prompt engineering has come to the fore. Prompt optimization emerges as a crucial challenge as it has a direct impact on model performance and the extraction of relevant information. Recently evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promise in addressing this issue paving the way for novel optimization strategies. In this work we propose a evolutionary multi-objective (EMO) approach specifically tailored for prompt optimization called EMO-Prompts using sentiment analysis as a case study. We use sentiment analysis capabilities as our experimental targets. Our results demonstrate that EMO-Prompts effectively generates prompts capable of guiding the LLM to produce texts embodying two conflicting emotions simultaneously.

The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to drive transformative
innovations, with significant progress in conversational interfaces, autonomous
vehicles, and intelligent content creation. Since the launch of ChatGPT in late
2022, the rise of Generative AI has marked a pivotal era, with the term Large
Language Models (LLMs) becoming a ubiquitous part of daily life. LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in tasks such as text summarization, code
generation, and creative writing. However, these models are inherently limited
by their token-level processing, which restricts their ability to perform
abstract reasoning, conceptual understanding, and efficient generation of
long-form content. To address these limitations, Meta has introduced Large
Concept Models (LCMs), representing a significant shift from traditional
token-based frameworks. LCMs use concepts as foundational units of
understanding, enabling more sophisticated semantic reasoning and context-aware
decision-making. Given the limited academic research on this emerging
technology, our study aims to bridge the knowledge gap by collecting,
analyzing, and synthesizing existing grey literature to provide a comprehensive
understanding of LCMs. Specifically, we (i) identify and describe the features
that distinguish LCMs from LLMs, (ii) explore potential applications of LCMs
across multiple domains, and (iii) propose future research directions and
practical strategies to advance LCM development and adoption.

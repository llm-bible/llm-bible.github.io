Multi45;hop question answering is a challenging task with distinct industrial relevance and Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) methods based on large language models (LLMs) have become a popular approach to tackle this task. Owing to the potential inability to retrieve all necessary information in a single iteration a series of iterative RAG methods has been recently developed showing significant performance improvements. However existing methods still face two critical challenges context overload resulting from multiple rounds of retrieval and over45;planning and repetitive planning due to the lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper we propose a novel iterative RAG method called ReSP equipped with a dual45;function summarizer. This summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents targeting both the overarching question and the current sub45;question concurrently. Experimental results on the multi45;hop question45;answering datasets HotpotQA and 2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state45;of45;the45;art and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.

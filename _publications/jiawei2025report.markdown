This report aims to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs)
in solving high school science questions and to explore their potential
applications in the educational field. With the rapid development of LLMs in
the field of natural language processing, their application in education has
attracted widespread attention. This study selected mathematics exam questions
from the college entrance examinations (2019-2023) as evaluation data and
utilized at least eight LLM APIs to provide answers. A comprehensive assessment
was conducted based on metrics such as accuracy, response time, logical
reasoning, and creativity. Through an in-depth analysis of the evaluation
results, this report reveals the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in handling
high school science questions and discusses their implications for educational
practice. The findings indicate that although LLMs perform excellently in
certain aspects, there is still room for improvement in logical reasoning and
creative problem-solving. This report provides an empirical foundation for
further research and application of LLMs in the educational field and offers
suggestions for improvement.

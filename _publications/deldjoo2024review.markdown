Traditional recommender systems (RS) typically use user-item rating histories
as their main data source. However, deep generative models now have the
capability to model and sample from complex data distributions, including
user-item interactions, text, images, and videos, enabling novel recommendation
tasks. This comprehensive, multidisciplinary survey connects key advancements
in RS using Generative Models (Gen-RecSys), covering: interaction-driven
generative models; the use of large language models (LLM) and textual data for
natural language recommendation; and the integration of multimodal models for
generating and processing images/videos in RS. Our work highlights necessary
paradigms for evaluating the impact and harm of Gen-RecSys and identifies open
challenges. This survey accompanies a tutorial presented at ACM KDD'24, with

Utilizing user profiles to personalize Large Language Models (LLMs) has been
shown to enhance the performance on a wide range of tasks. However, the precise
role of user profiles and their effect mechanism on LLMs remains unclear. This
study first confirms that the effectiveness of user profiles is primarily due
to personalization information rather than semantic information. Furthermore,
we investigate how user profiles affect the personalization of LLMs. Within the
user profile, we reveal that it is the historical personalized response
produced or approved by users that plays a pivotal role in personalizing LLMs.
This discovery unlocks the potential of LLMs to incorporate a greater number of
user profiles within the constraints of limited input length. As for the
position of user profiles, we observe that user profiles integrated into
different positions of the input context do not contribute equally to
personalization. Instead, where the user profile that is closer to the
beginning affects more on the personalization of LLMs. Our findings reveal the
role of user profiles for the personalization of LLMs, and showcase how
incorporating user profiles impacts performance providing insight to leverage
user profiles effectively.

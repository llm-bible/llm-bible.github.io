To alleviate the problem of structured databases limited coverage recent task45;oriented dialogue systems incorporate external unstructured knowledge to guide the generation of system responses. However these usually use word or sentence level similarities to detect the relevant knowledge context which only partially capture the topical level relevance. In this paper we examine how to better integrate topical information in knowledge grounded task45;oriented dialogue and propose Topic45;Aware Response Generation (TARG) an end45;to45;end response generation model. TARG incorporates multiple topic45;aware attention mechanisms to derive the importance weighting scheme over dialogue utterances and external knowledge sources towards a better understanding of the dialogue history. Experimental results indicate that TARG achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance in knowledge selection and response generation outperforming previous state45;of45;the45;art by 3.2 3.6 and 4.2 points in EM F1 and BLEU45;4 respectively on Doc2Dial and performing comparably with previous work on DSTC9; both being knowledge45;grounded task45;oriented dialogue datasets.

This paper presents novel systems and methodologies for the development of efficient large language models (LLMs). It explores the trade45;offs between model size performance and computational resources with the aim of maximizing the efficiency of these AI systems. The research explores novel methods that allow different parts of the model to share parameters reducing the total number of unique parameters required. This approach ensures that the model remains compact without sacrificing its ability to learn and represent complex language structures. This study provides valuable insights and tools for creating more efficient and effective LLMs contributing to a more sustainable and accessible future for AI language modeling.

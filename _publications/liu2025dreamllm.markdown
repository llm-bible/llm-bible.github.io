We present DreamLLM-3D, a composite multimodal AI system behind an immersive
art installation for dream re-experiencing. It enables automated dream content
analysis for immersive dream-reliving, by integrating a Large Language Model
(LLM) with text-to-3D Generative AI. The LLM processes voiced dream reports to
identify key dream entities (characters and objects), social interaction, and
dream sentiment. The extracted entities are visualized as dynamic 3D point
clouds, with emotional data influencing the color and soundscapes of the
virtual dream environment. Additionally, we propose an experiential
AI-Dreamworker Hybrid paradigm. Our system and paradigm could potentially
facilitate a more emotionally engaging dream-reliving experience, enhancing
personal insights and creativity.

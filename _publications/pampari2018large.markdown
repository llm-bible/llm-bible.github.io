We propose a novel methodology to generate domain-specific large-scale
question answering (QA) datasets by re-purposing existing annotations for other
NLP tasks. We demonstrate an instance of this methodology in generating a
large-scale QA dataset for electronic medical records by leveraging existing
expert annotations on clinical notes for various NLP tasks from the community
shared i2b2 datasets. The resulting corpus (emrQA) has 1 million
question-logical form and 400,000+ question-answer evidence pairs. We
characterize the dataset and explore its learning potential by training
baseline models for question to logical form and question to answer mapping.

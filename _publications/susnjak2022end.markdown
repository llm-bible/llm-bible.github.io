This study evaluated the ability of ChatGPT, a recently developed artificial
intelligence (AI) agent, to perform high-level cognitive tasks and produce text
that is indistinguishable from human-generated text. This capacity raises
concerns about the potential use of ChatGPT as a tool for academic misconduct
in online exams. The study found that ChatGPT is capable of exhibiting critical
thinking skills and generating highly realistic text with minimal input, making
it a potential threat to the integrity of online exams, particularly in
tertiary education settings where such exams are becoming more prevalent.
Returning to invigilated and oral exams could form part of the solution, while
using advanced proctoring techniques and AI-text output detectors may be
effective in addressing this issue, they are not likely to be foolproof
solutions. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of
large language models like ChatGPT and to devise strategies for combating the
risk of cheating using these tools. It is crucial for educators and
institutions to be aware of the possibility of ChatGPT being used for cheating
and to investigate measures to address it in order to maintain the fairness and
validity of online exams for all students.

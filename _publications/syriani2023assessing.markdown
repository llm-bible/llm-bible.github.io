By organizing knowledge within a research field Systematic Reviews (SR) provide valuable leads to steer research. Evidence suggests that SRs have become first-class artifacts in software engineering. However the tedious manual effort associated with the screening phase of SRs renders these studies a costly and error-prone endeavor. While screening has traditionally been considered not amenable to automation the advent of generative AI-driven chatbots backed with large language models is set to disrupt the field. In this report we propose an approach to leverage these novel technological developments for automating the screening of SRs. We assess the consistency classification performance and generalizability of ChatGPT in screening articles for SRs and compare these figures with those of traditional classifiers used in SR automation. Our results indicate that ChatGPT is a viable option to automate the SR processes but requires careful considerations from developers when integrating ChatGPT into their SR tools.

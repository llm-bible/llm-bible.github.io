Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various aspects of education,
with large language models (LLMs) driving advancements in automated tutoring,
assessment, and content generation. However, conventional LLMs are constrained
by their reliance on static training data, limited adaptability, and lack of
reasoning. To address these limitations and foster more sustainable
technological practices, AI agents have emerged as a promising new avenue for
educational innovation. In this review, we examine agentic workflows in
education according to four major paradigms: reflection, planning, tool use,
and multi-agent collaboration. We critically analyze the role of AI agents in
education through these key design paradigms, exploring their advantages,
applications, and challenges. To illustrate the practical potential of agentic
systems, we present a proof-of-concept application: a multi-agent framework for
automated essay scoring. Preliminary results suggest this agentic approach may
offer improved consistency compared to stand-alone LLMs. Our findings highlight
the transformative potential of AI agents in educational settings while
underscoring the need for further research into their interpretability,
trustworthiness, and sustainable impact on pedagogical impact.

Large language models (LLMs) have attracted considerable attention as they are capable of showcasing impressive capabilities generating comparable high-quality responses to human inputs. LLMs can not only compose textual scripts such as emails and essays but also executable programming code. Contrary the automated reasoning capability of these LLMs in performing statistically-driven descriptive analysis particularly on user-specific data and as personal assistants to users with limited background knowledge in an application domain who would like to carry out basic as well as advanced statistical and domain-specific analysis is not yet fully explored. More importantly the performance of these LLMs has not been compared and discussed in detail when domain-specific data analysis tasks are needed. This study consequently explores whether LLMs can be used as generative AI-based personal assistants to users with minimal background knowledge in an application domain infer key data insights. To demonstrate the performance of the LLMs the study reports a case study through which descriptive statistical analysis as well as Natural Language Processing (NLP) based investigations are performed on a number of phishing emails with the objective of comparing the accuracy of the results generated by LLMs to the ones produced by analysts. The experimental results show that LangChain and the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-4) excel in numerical reasoning tasks i.e. temporal statistical analysis achieve competitive correlation with human judgments on feature engineering tasks while struggle to some extent on domain specific knowledge reasoning where domain-specific knowledge is required.

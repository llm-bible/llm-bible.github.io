Neural Module Networks (NMN) are a compelling method for visual question answering enabling the translation of a question into a program consisting of a series of reasoning sub45;tasks that are sequentially executed on the image to produce an answer. NMNs provide enhanced explainability compared to integrated models allowing for a better understanding of the underlying reasoning process. To improve the effectiveness of NMNs we propose to exploit features obtained by a large45;scale cross45;modal encoder. Also the current training approach of NMNs relies on the propagation of module outputs to subsequent modules leading to the accumulation of prediction errors and the generation of false answers. To mitigate this we introduce an NMN learning strategy involving scheduled teacher guidance. Initially the model is fully guided by the ground45;truth intermediate outputs but gradually transitions to an autonomous behavior as training progresses. This reduces error accumulation thus improving training efficiency and final performance.We demonstrate that by incorporating cross45;modal features and employing more effective training techniques for NMN we achieve a favorable balance between performance and transparency in the reasoning process.

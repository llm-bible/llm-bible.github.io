The tasks of out45;of45;domain (OOD) intent discovery and generalized intent discovery (GID) aim to extend a closed intent classifier to open45;world intent sets which is crucial to task45;oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. Previous methods address them by fine45;tuning discriminative models. Recently although some studies have been exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT to various downstream tasks it is still unclear for the ability of ChatGPT to discover and incrementally extent OOD intents. In this paper we comprehensively evaluate ChatGPT on OOD intent discovery and GID and then outline the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT. Overall ChatGPT exhibits consistent advantages under zero45;shot settings but is still at a disadvantage compared to fine45;tuned models. More deeply through a series of analytical experiments we summarize and discuss the challenges faced by LLMs including clustering domain45;specific understanding and cross45;domain in45;context learning scenarios. Finally we provide empirical guidance for future directions to address these challenges.

In this paper, we investigate the use of data obtained from prompting a large
generative language model, ChatGPT, to generate synthetic training data with
the aim of augmenting data in low resource scenarios. We show that with
appropriate task-specific ChatGPT prompts, we outperform the most popular
existing approaches for such data augmentation. Furthermore, we investigate
methodologies for evaluating the similarity of the augmented data generated
from ChatGPT with the aim of validating and assessing the quality of the data
generated.

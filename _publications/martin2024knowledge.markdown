Many Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM-powered apps deployed today use
some form of prompt filter or alignment to protect their integrity. However,
these measures aren't foolproof. This paper introduces KROP, a prompt injection
technique capable of obfuscating prompt injection attacks, rendering them
virtually undetectable to most of these security measures.

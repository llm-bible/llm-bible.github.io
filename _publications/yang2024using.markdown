Tables, figures, and listings (TFLs) are essential tools for summarizing
clinical trial data. Creation of TFLs for reporting activities is often a
time-consuming task encountered routinely during the execution of clinical
trials. This study explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to automate
the generation of TFLs through prompt engineering and few-shot transfer
learning. Using public clinical trial data in ADaM format, our results
demonstrated that LLMs can efficiently generate TFLs with prompt instructions,
showcasing their potential in this domain. Furthermore, we developed a
conservational agent named Clinical Trial TFL Generation Agent: An app that
matches user queries to predefined prompts that produce customized programs to
generate specific predefined TFLs.

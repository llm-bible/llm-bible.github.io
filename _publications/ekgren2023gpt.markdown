This paper details the process of developing the first native large generative language model for the Nordic languages GPT-SW3. We cover all parts of the development process from data collection and processing training configuration and instruction finetuning to evaluation and considerations for release strategies. We hope that this paper can serve as a guide and reference for other researchers that undertake the development of large generative models for smaller languages.

In this work, we present a benchmark that consists of Jupyter notebooks
development trajectories and allows measuring how large language models (LLMs)
can leverage runtime information for predicting code output and code
generation. We demonstrate that the current generation of LLMs performs poorly
on these tasks and argue that there exists a significantly understudied domain
in the development of code-based models, which involves incorporating the
runtime context.

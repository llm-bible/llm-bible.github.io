The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) necessitates accurate AI-generated
text detection. However, current approaches largely overlook the influence of
author characteristics. We investigate how sociolinguistic attributes-gender,
CEFR proficiency, academic field, and language environment-impact
state-of-the-art AI text detectors. Using the ICNALE corpus of human-authored
texts and parallel AI-generated texts from diverse LLMs, we conduct a rigorous
evaluation employing multi-factor ANOVA and weighted least squares (WLS). Our
results reveal significant biases: CEFR proficiency and language environment
consistently affected detector accuracy, while gender and academic field showed
detector-dependent effects. These findings highlight the crucial need for
socially aware AI text detection to avoid unfairly penalizing specific
demographic groups. We offer novel empirical evidence, a robust statistical
framework, and actionable insights for developing more equitable and reliable
detection systems in real-world, out-of-domain contexts. This work paves the
way for future research on bias mitigation, inclusive evaluation benchmarks,
and socially responsible LLM detectors.

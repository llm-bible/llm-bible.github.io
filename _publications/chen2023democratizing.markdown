This paper presents our efforts to democratize ChatGPT across language. We
release a large language model "Phoenix", achieving competitive performance
among open-source English and Chinese models while excelling in languages with
limited resources (covering both Latin and non-Latin languages). We believe
this work will be beneficial to make ChatGPT more accessible, especially in
countries where people cannot use ChatGPT due to restrictions from OpenAI or
local goverments. Our data, code, and models are available at

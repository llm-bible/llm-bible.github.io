This paper surveys evaluation techniques to enhance the trustworthiness and understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs). As reliance on LLMs grows ensuring their reliability fairness and transparency is crucial. We explore algorithmic methods and metrics to assess LLM performance identify weaknesses and guide development towards more trustworthy applications. Key evaluation metrics include Perplexity Measurement NLP metrics (BLEU ROUGE METEOR BERTScore GLEU Word Error Rate Character Error Rate) Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning Performance Transfer Learning Evaluation Adversarial Testing and Fairness and Bias Evaluation. We introduce innovative approaches like LLMMaps for stratified evaluation Benchmarking and Leaderboards for competitive assessment Stratified Analysis for in-depth understanding Visualization of Blooms Taxonomy for cognitive level accuracy distribution Hallucination Score for quantifying inaccuracies Knowledge Stratification Strategy for hierarchical analysis and Machine Learning Models for Hierarchy Generation. Human Evaluation is highlighted for capturing nuances that automated metrics may miss. These techniques form a framework for evaluating LLMs aiming to enhance transparency guide development and establish user trust. Future papers will describe metric visualization and demonstrate each approach on practical examples.

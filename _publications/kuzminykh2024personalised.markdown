AI tools, particularly large language modules, have recently proven their
effectiveness within learning management systems and online education
programmes. As feedback continues to play a crucial role in learning and
assessment in schools, educators must carefully customise the use of AI tools
in order to optimally support students in their learning journey. Efforts to
improve educational feedback systems have seen numerous attempts reflected in
the research studies but mostly have been focusing on qualitatively
benchmarking AI feedback against human-generated feedback. This paper presents
an exploration of an alternative feedback framework which extends the
capabilities of ChatGPT by integrating embeddings, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of educational materials and facilitating topic-targeted feedback
for quiz-based assessments. As part of the study, we proposed and developed a
proof of concept solution, achieving an efficacy rate of 90% and 100% for
open-ended and multiple-choice questions, respectively. The results showed that
our framework not only surpasses expectations but also rivals human narratives,
highlighting the potential of AI in revolutionising educational feedback
mechanisms.

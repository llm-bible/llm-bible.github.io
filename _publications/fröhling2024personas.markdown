We present a novel approach for enhancing diversity and control in data
annotation tasks by personalizing large language models (LLMs). We investigate
the impact of injecting diverse persona descriptions into LLM prompts across
two studies, exploring whether personas increase annotation diversity and
whether the impacts of individual personas on the resulting annotations are
consistent and controllable. Our results show that persona-prompted LLMs
produce more diverse annotations than LLMs prompted without personas and that
these effects are both controllable and repeatable, making our approach a
suitable tool for improving data annotation in subjective NLP tasks like
toxicity detection.

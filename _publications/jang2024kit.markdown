Instruction Tuning on Large Language Models is an essential process for model to function well and achieve high performance in specific tasks. Accordingly in mainstream languages such as English instruction-based datasets are being constructed and made publicly available. In the case of Korean publicly available models and datasets all rely on using the output of ChatGPT or translating datasets built in English. In this paper We introduce (textit)KIT-19 as an instruction dataset for the development of LLM in Korean. (textit)KIT-19 is a dataset created in an instruction format comprising 19 existing open-source datasets for Korean NLP tasks. In this paper we train a Korean Pretrained LLM using (textit)KIT-19 to demonstrate its effectiveness. The experimental results show that the model trained on (textit)KIT-19 significantly outperforms existing Korean LLMs. Based on the its quality and empirical results this paper proposes that (textit)KIT-19 has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the future improvement of Korean LLMs performance.

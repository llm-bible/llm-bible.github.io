Large45;scale pre45;trained language models have demonstrated strong knowledge representation ability. However recent studies suggest that even though these giant models contains rich simple commonsense knowledge (e.g. bird can fly and fish can swim.) they often struggle with the complex commonsense knowledge that involves multiple eventualities (verb45;centric phrases e.g. identifying the relationship between Jim yells at Bob and Bob is upset).To address this problem in this paper we propose to help pre45;trained language models better incorporate complex commonsense knowledge. Different from existing fine45;tuning approaches we do not focus on a specific task and propose a general language model named CoCoLM. Through the careful training over a large45;scale eventuality knowledge graphs ASER we successfully teach pre45;trained language models (i.e. BERT and RoBERTa) rich complex commonsense knowledge among eventualities. Experiments on multiple downstream commonsense tasks that requires the correct understanding of eventualities demonstrate the effectiveness of CoCoLM.

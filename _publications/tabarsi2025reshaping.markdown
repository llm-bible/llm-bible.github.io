Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and GitHub
Copilot are rapidly gaining traction in the software industry, but their full
impact on software engineering remains insufficiently explored. Despite their
growing adoption, there is a notable lack of formal, qualitative assessments of
how LLMs are applied in real-world software development contexts. To fill this
gap, we conducted semi-structured interviews with sixteen early-adopter
professional developers to explore their use of LLMs throughout various stages
of the software development life cycle. Our investigation examines four
dimensions: people - how LLMs affect individual developers and teams; process -
how LLMs alter software engineering workflows; product - LLM impact on software
quality and innovation; and society - the broader socioeconomic and ethical
implications of LLM adoption. Thematic analysis of our data reveals that while
LLMs have not fundamentally revolutionized the development process, they have
substantially enhanced routine coding tasks, including code generation,
refactoring, and debugging. Developers reported the most effective outcomes
when providing LLMs with clear, well-defined problem statements, indicating
that LLMs excel with decomposed problems and specific requirements.
Furthermore, these early-adopters identified that LLMs offer significant value
for personal and professional development, aiding in learning new languages and
concepts. Early-adopters, highly skilled in software engineering and how LLMs
work, identified early and persisting challenges for software engineering, such
as inaccuracies in generated content and the need for careful manual review
before integrating LLM outputs into production environments. Our study provides
a nuanced understanding of how LLMs are shaping the landscape of software
development, with their benefits, limitations, and ongoing implications.

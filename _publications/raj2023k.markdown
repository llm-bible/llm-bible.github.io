Personalizing conversational agents can enhance the quality of conversations and increase user engagement. However they often lack external knowledge to appropriately tend to a users persona. This is particularly crucial for practical applications like mental health support nutrition planning culturally sensitive conversations or reducing toxic behavior in conversational agents. To enhance the relevance and comprehensiveness of personalized responses we propose using a two45;step approach that involves (1) selectively integrating user personas and (2) contextualizing the response with supplementing information from a background knowledge source. We develop K45;PERM (Knowledge45;guided PErsonalization with Reward Modulation) a dynamic conversational agent that combines these elements. K45;PERM achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance on the popular FoCus dataset containing real45;world personalized conversations concerning global landmarks. We show that using responses from K45;PERM can improve performance in state45;of45;the45;art LLMs (GPT 3.5) by 10.537; highlighting the impact of K45;PERM for personalizing chatbots.

Social science NLP tasks such as emotion or humor detection are required to capture the semantics along with the implicit pragmatics from text often with limited amounts of training data. Instruction tuning has been shown to improve the many capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as commonsense reasoning reading comprehension and computer programming. However little is known about the effectiveness of instruction tuning on the social domain where implicit pragmatic cues are often needed to be captured. We explore the use of instruction tuning for social science NLP tasks and introduce Socialite-Llama -- an open-source instruction-tuned Llama. On a suite of 20 social science tasks Socialite-Llama improves upon the performance of Llama as well as matches or improves upon the performance of a state-of-the-art multi-task finetuned model on a majority of them. Further Socialite-Llama also leads to improvement on 5 out of 6 related social tasks as compared to Llama suggesting instruction tuning can lead to generalized social understanding. All resources including our code model and dataset can be found through bit.ly/socialitellama.

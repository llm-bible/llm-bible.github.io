This work presents BanglaNLG a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating natural language generation (NLG) models in Bangla a widely spoken yet low-resource language. We aggregate six challenging conditional text generation tasks under the BanglaNLG benchmark introducing a new dataset on dialogue generation in the process. Furthermore using a clean corpus of 27.5 GB of Bangla data we pretrain BanglaT5 a sequence-to-sequence Transformer language model for Bangla. BanglaT5 achieves state-of-the-art performance in all of these tasks outperforming several multilingual models by up to 937; absolute gain and 3237; relative gain. We are making the new dialogue dataset and the BanglaT5 model publicly available at https://github.com/csebuetnlp/BanglaNLG in the hope of advancing future research on Bangla NLG.

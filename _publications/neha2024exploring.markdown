The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has led to the creation
of powerful text generation models, such as large language models (LLMs), which
are widely used for diverse applications. However, concerns surrounding
AI-generated content, including issues of originality, bias, misinformation,
and accountability, have become increasingly prominent. This paper offers a
comprehensive overview of AI text generators (AITGs), focusing on their
evolution, capabilities, and ethical implications. This paper also introduces
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a recent approach that improves the
contextual relevance and accuracy of text generation by integrating dynamic
information retrieval. RAG addresses key limitations of traditional models,
including their reliance on static knowledge and potential inaccuracies in
handling real-world data. Additionally, the paper reviews detection tools that
help differentiate AI-generated text from human-written content and discusses
the ethical challenges these technologies pose. The paper explores future
directions for improving detection accuracy, supporting ethical AI development,
and increasing accessibility. The paper contributes to a more responsible and
reliable use of AI in content creation through these discussions.

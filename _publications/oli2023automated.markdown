Assessing students answers and in particular natural language answers is a crucial challenge in the field of education. Advances in machine learning including transformer-based models such as Large Language Models(LLMs) have led to significant progress in various natural language tasks. Nevertheless amidst the growing trend of evaluating LLMs across diverse tasks evaluating LLMs in the realm of automated answer assesment has not received much attention. To address this gap we explore the potential of using LLMs for automated assessment of students short and open-ended answer. Particularly we use LLMs to compare students explanations with expert explanations in the context of line-by-line explanations of computer programs. For comparison purposes we assess both Large Language Models (LLMs) and encoder-based Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) models in the context of assessing the correctness of students explanation of computer code. Our findings indicate that LLMs when prompted in few-shot and chain-of-thought setting perform comparable to fine-tuned encoder-based models in evaluating students short answers in programming domain.

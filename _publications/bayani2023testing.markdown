Over the eight months since its release, ChatGPT and its underlying model,
GPT3.5, have garnered massive attention, due to their potent mix of capability
and accessibility. While a niche-industry of papers have emerged examining the
scope of capabilities these models possess, the information fed to and
extracted from these networks has been either natural language text or
stylized, code-like language. Drawing inspiration from the prowess we expect a
truly human-level intelligent agent to have across multiple signal modalities,
in this work we examine GPT3.5's aptitude for visual tasks, where the inputs
feature content provided as ASCII-art without overt distillation into a lingual
summary. We conduct experiments analyzing the model's performance on image
recognition tasks after various transforms typical in visual settings, trials
investigating knowledge of image parts, and tasks covering image generation.

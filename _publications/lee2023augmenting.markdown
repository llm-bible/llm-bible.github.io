The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new opportunities in the field of mobile task automation. Their superior language understanding and reasoning capabilities allow users to automate complex and repetitive tasks. However due to the inherent unreliability and high operational cost of LLMs their practical applicability is quite limited. To address these issues this paper introduces MobileGPT an innovative LLM45;based mobile task automator equipped with a human45;like app memory. MobileGPT emulates the cognitive process of humans interacting with a mobile app 45;45; explore select derive and recall. This approach allows for a more precise and efficient learning of a tasks procedure by breaking it down into smaller modular sub45;tasks that can be re45;used re45;arranged and adapted for various objectives. We implement MobileGPT using online LLMs services (GPT45;3.5 and GPT45;4) and evaluate its performance on a dataset of 160 user instructions across 8 widely used mobile apps. The results indicate that MobileGPT can automate and learn new tasks with 82.537; accuracy and is able to adapt them to different contexts with near perfect (98.7537;) accuracy while reducing both latency and cost by 62.537; and 68.837; respectively compared to the GPT45;4 powered baseline.

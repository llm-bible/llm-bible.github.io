In this paper, we present Speak Ease: an augmentative and alternative
communication (AAC) system to support users' expressivity by integrating
multimodal input, including text, voice, and contextual cues (conversational
partner and emotional tone), with large language models (LLMs). Speak Ease
combines automatic speech recognition (ASR), context-aware LLM-based outputs,
and personalized text-to-speech technologies to enable more personalized,
natural-sounding, and expressive communication. Through an exploratory
feasibility study and focus group evaluation with speech and language
pathologists (SLPs), we assessed Speak Ease's potential to enable expressivity
in AAC. The findings highlight the priorities and needs of AAC users and the
system's ability to enhance user expressivity by supporting more personalized
and contextually relevant communication. This work provides insights into the
use of multimodal inputs and LLM-driven features to improve AAC systems and
support expressivity.

This paper describes our submission for SemEval-2025 Task 3: Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes. The task involves detecting hallucinated spans in text generated by instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple languages. Our approach combines task-specific prompt engineering with an LLM ensemble verification mechanism, where a primary model extracts hallucination spans and three independent LLMs adjudicate their validity through probability-based voting. This framework simulates the human annotation workflow used in the shared task validation and test data. Additionally, fuzzy matching refines span alignment. Our system ranked 1st in Arabic and Basque, 2nd in German, Swedish, and Finnish, and 3rd in Czech, Farsi, and French.

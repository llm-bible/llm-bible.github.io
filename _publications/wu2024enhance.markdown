This paper presents an innovative framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with an external Thinker module to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLM45;based agents. Unlike augmenting LLMs with prompt engineering Thinker directly harnesses knowledge from databases and employs various optimization techniques. The framework forms a reasoning hierarchy where LLMs handle intuitive System45;1 tasks such as natural language processing while the Thinker focuses on cognitive System45;2 tasks that require complex logical analysis and domain45;specific knowledge. Our framework is presented using a 945;player Werewolf game that demands dual45;system reasoning. We introduce a communication protocol between LLMs and the Thinker and train the Thinker using data from 18800 human sessions and reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate the frameworks effectiveness in deductive reasoning speech generation and online game evaluation. Additionally we fine45;tune a 6B LLM to surpass GPT4 when integrated with the Thinker. This paper also contributes the largest dataset for social deduction games to date.

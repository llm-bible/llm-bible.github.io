Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large language models (MLLMs) have taken the world by storm with impressive abilities in complex reasoning and linguistic comprehension. Meanwhile there are plethora of works related to Vietnamese Large Language Models the lack of high-quality resources in multimodality limits the progress of Vietnamese MLLMs. In this paper we pioneer in address this by introducing LaVy a state-of-the-art Vietnamese MLLM and we also introduce LaVy-Bench benchmark designated for evaluating MLLMss understanding on Vietnamese visual language tasks. Our project is public at https://github.com/baochi0212/LaVy"

Many studies exploring the adoption of Large Language Model-based tools for
software development by junior developers have emerged in recent years. These
studies have sought to understand developers' perspectives about using those
tools, a fundamental pillar for successfully adopting LLM-based tools in
Software Engineering. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of junior
software developers' perspectives and use of LLM-based tools for software
engineering (LLM4SE). We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR)
following guidelines by Kitchenham et al. on 56 primary studies, applying the
definition for junior software developers as software developers with equal or
less than five years of experience, including Computer Science/Software
Engineering students. We found that the majority of the studies focused on
comprehending the different aspects of integrating AI tools in SE. Only 8.9%
of the studies provide a clear definition for junior software developers, and
there is no uniformity. Searching for relevant information is the most common
task using LLM tools. ChatGPT was the most common LLM tool present in the
studies (and experiments). A majority of the studies (83.9%) report both
positive and negative perceptions about the impact of adopting LLM tools. We
also found and categorised advantages, challenges, and recommendations
regarding LLM adoption. Our results indicate that developers are using LLMs not
just for code generation, but also to improve their development skills.
Critically, they are not just experiencing the benefits of adopting LLM tools,
but they are also aware of at least a few LLM limitations, such as the
generation of wrong suggestions, potential data leaking, and AI hallucination.
Our findings offer implications for software engineering researchers,
educators, and developers.

Prompt engineering is critical for effective interaction with large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. However efforts to teach this skill to students have been limited. This study designed and implemented a prompt engineering intervention examining its influence on undergraduate students AI self-efficacy AI knowledge and proficiency in creating effective prompts. The intervention involved 27 students who participated in a 100-minute workshop conducted during their history course at a university in Hong Kong. During the workshop students were introduced to prompt engineering strategies which they applied to plan the courses final essay task. Multiple data sources were collected including students responses to pre- and post-workshop questionnaires pre- and post-workshop prompt libraries and written reflections. The studys findings revealed that students demonstrated a higher level of AI self-efficacy an enhanced understanding of AI concepts and improved prompt engineering skills because of the intervention. These findings have implications for AI literacy education as they highlight the importance of prompt engineering training for specific higher education use cases. This is a significant shift from students haphazardly and intuitively learning to engineer prompts. Through prompt engineering education educators can faciitate students effective navigation and leverage of LLMs to support their coursework.

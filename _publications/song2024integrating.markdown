The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots into higher education marks a shift towards a new generation of pedagogical tools mirroring the arrival of milestones like the internet. With the launch of ChatGPT-4 Turbo in November 2023 we developed a ChatGPT-based teaching application (https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1imx1py4K-chatge-medical-imaging) and integrated it into our undergraduate medical imaging course in the Spring 2024 semester. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT throughout a semester-long trial providing insights into students engagement perception and the overall educational effectiveness of the technology. We systematically collected and analyzed data concerning students interaction with ChatGPT focusing on their attitudes concerns and usage patterns. The findings indicate that ChatGPT offers significant advantages such as improved information access and increased interactivity but its adoption is accompanied by concerns about the accuracy of the information provided and the necessity for well-defined guidelines to optimize its use.

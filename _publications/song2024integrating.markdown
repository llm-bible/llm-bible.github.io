The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots into higher
education marks a shift towards a new generation of pedagogical tools,
mirroring the arrival of milestones like the internet. With the launch of
ChatGPT-4 Turbo in November 2023, we developed a ChatGPT-based teaching
application (https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1imx1py4K-chatge-medical-imaging) and
integrated it into our undergraduate medical imaging course in the Spring 2024
semester. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT throughout a semester-long
trial, providing insights into students' engagement, perception, and the
overall educational effectiveness of the technology. We systematically
collected and analyzed data concerning students' interaction with ChatGPT,
focusing on their attitudes, concerns, and usage patterns. The findings
indicate that ChatGPT offers significant advantages such as improved
information access and increased interactivity, but its adoption is accompanied
by concerns about the accuracy of the information provided and the necessity
for well-defined guidelines to optimize its use.

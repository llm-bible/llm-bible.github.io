Legal writing demands clarity, formality, and domain-specific
precision-qualities often lacking in documents authored by individuals without
legal training. To bridge this gap, this paper explores the task of legal text
refinement that transforms informal, conversational inputs into persuasive
legal arguments. We introduce FinDR, a Chinese dataset of financial dispute
records, annotated with official judgments on claim reasonableness. Our
proposed method, Multi-Scale Model Interaction (MSMI), leverages a lightweight
classifier to evaluate outputs and guide iterative refinement by Large Language
Models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that MSMI significantly
outperforms single-pass prompting strategies. Additionally, we validate the
generalizability of MSMI on several short-text benchmarks, showing improved
adversarial robustness. Our findings reveal the potential of multi-model
collaboration for enhancing legal document generation and broader text
refinement tasks.

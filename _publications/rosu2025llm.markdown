This paper introduces an LLM-based Latin-to-English translation platform
designed to address the challenges of translating Latin texts. We named the
model LITERA, which stands for Latin Interpretation and Translations into
English for Research Assistance. Through a multi-layered translation process
utilizing a fine-tuned version of GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o, LITERA offers an
unprecedented level of accuracy, showcased by greatly improved BLEU scores,
particularly in classical Latin, along with improved BLEURT scores. The
development of LITERA involved close collaboration with Duke University's
Classical Studies Department, which was instrumental in creating a small,
high-quality parallel Latin-English dataset. This paper details the
architecture, fine-tuning methodology, and prompting strategies used in LITERA,
emphasizing its ability to produce literal translations.

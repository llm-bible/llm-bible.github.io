Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP) demonstrating remarkable abilities in producing text that resembles human language for various tasks. This opens up new opportunities for employing them in recommender systems (RSs). In this paper we specifically examine the sample efficiency of LLM45;enhanced recommender systems which pertains to the models capacity to attain superior performance with a limited quantity of training data. Conventional recommendation models (CRMs) often need a large amount of training data because of the sparsity of features and interactions. Hence we propose and verify our core viewpoint Large Language Models Make Sample45;Efficient Recommender Systems. We propose a simple yet effective framework (i.e. Laser) to validate the viewpoint from two aspects (1) LLMs themselves are sample45;efficient recommenders; and (2) LLMs as feature generators and encoders make CRMs more sample45;efficient. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that Laser requires only a small fraction of training samples to match or even surpass CRMs that are trained on the entire training set demonstrating superior sample efficiency.

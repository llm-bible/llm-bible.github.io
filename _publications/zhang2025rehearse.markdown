Personalized opinion summarization is crucial as it considers individual user
interests while generating product summaries. Recent studies show that although
large language models demonstrate powerful text summarization and evaluation
capabilities without the need for training data, they face difficulties in
personalized tasks involving long texts. To address this, \textbf\{Rehearsal\}, a
personalized opinion summarization framework via LLMs-based role-playing is
proposed. Having the model act as the user, the model can better understand the
user's personalized needs. Additionally, a role-playing supervisor and practice
process are introduced to improve the role-playing ability of the LLMs, leading
to a better expression of user needs. Furthermore, through suggestions from
virtual users, the summary generation is intervened, ensuring that the
generated summary includes information of interest to the user, thus achieving
personalized summary generation. Experiment results demonstrate that our method
can effectively improve the level of personalization in large model-generated
summaries.

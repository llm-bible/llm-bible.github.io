Text simplification is essential for making complex content accessible to
diverse audiences who face comprehension challenges. Yet, the limited
availability of simplified materials creates significant barriers to personal
and professional growth and hinders social inclusion. Although researchers have
explored various methods for automatic text simplification, none fully leverage
large language models (LLMs) to offer tailored customization for different
target groups and varying levels of simplicity. Moreover, despite its proven
benefits for both consumers and organizations, the well-established practice of
plain language remains underutilized. In this paper, we
https://simplifymytext.org, the first system designed to produce plain language
content from multiple input formats, including typed text and file uploads,
with flexible customization options for diverse audiences. We employ GPT-4 and
Llama-3 and evaluate outputs across multiple metrics. Overall, our work
contributes to research on automatic text simplification and highlights the
importance of tailored communication in promoting inclusivity.

This study investigates the metacognitive capabilities of Large Language Models relative to human metacognition in the context of the International Coaching Federation ICF mimicking exam a situational judgment test related to coaching competencies. Using a mixed method approach we assessed the metacognitive performance including sensitivity accuracy in probabilistic predictions and bias of human participants and five advanced LLMs (GPT-4 Claude-3-Opus 3 Mistral Large Llama 3 and Gemini 1.5 Pro). The results indicate that LLMs outperformed humans across all metacognitive metrics particularly in terms of reduced overconfidence compared to humans. However both LLMs and humans showed less adaptability in ambiguous scenarios adhering closely to predefined decision frameworks. The study suggests that Generative AI can effectively engage in human-like metacognitive processing without conscious awareness. Implications of the study are discussed in relation to development of AI simulators that scaffold cognitive and metacognitive aspects of mastering coaching competencies. More broadly implications of these results are discussed in relation to development of metacognitive modules that lead towards more autonomous and intuitive AI systems.

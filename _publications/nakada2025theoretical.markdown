Prompt engineering has emerged as a powerful technique for guiding large
language models (LLMs) toward desired responses, significantly enhancing their
performance across diverse tasks. Beyond their role as static predictors, LLMs
increasingly function as intelligent agents, capable of reasoning,
decision-making, and adapting dynamically to complex environments. However, the
theoretical underpinnings of prompt engineering remain largely unexplored. In
this paper, we introduce a formal framework demonstrating that transformer
models, when provided with carefully designed prompts, can act as a
configurable computational system by emulating a ``virtual'' neural network
during inference. Specifically, input prompts effectively translate into the
corresponding network configuration, enabling LLMs to adjust their internal
computations dynamically. Building on this construction, we establish an
approximation theory for \\(\beta\\)-times differentiable functions, proving that
transformers can approximate such functions with arbitrary precision when
guided by appropriately structured prompts. Moreover, our framework provides
theoretical justification for several empirically successful prompt engineering
techniques, including the use of longer, structured prompts, filtering
irrelevant information, enhancing prompt token diversity, and leveraging
multi-agent interactions. By framing LLMs as adaptable agents rather than
static models, our findings underscore their potential for autonomous reasoning
and problem-solving, paving the way for more robust and theoretically grounded
advancements in prompt engineering and AI agent design.

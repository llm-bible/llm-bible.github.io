Quality Estimation (QE) is an important component of the machine translation workflow as it assesses the quality of the translated output without consulting reference translations. In this paper we discuss our submission to the WMT 2021 QE Shared Task. We participate in Task 2 sentence45;level sub45;task that challenge participants to predict the HTER score for sentence45;level post45;editing effort. Our proposed system is an ensemble of multilingual BERT (mBERT)45;based regression models which are generated by fine45;tuning on different input settings. It demonstrates comparable performance with respect to the Pearsons correlation and beats the baseline system in MAE/ RMSE for several language pairs. In addition we adapt our system for the zero45;shot setting by exploiting target language45;relevant language pairs and pseudo45;reference translations.

Our proposed method ReSeTOX (REdo SEarch if TOXic) addresses the issue of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) generating translation outputs that contain toxic words not present in the input. The objective is to mitigate the introduction of toxic language without the need for re45;training. In the case of identified added toxicity during the inference process ReSeTOX dynamically adjusts the key45;value self45;attention weights and re45;evaluates the beam search hypotheses. Experimental results demonstrate that ReSeTOX achieves a remarkable 5737; reduction in added toxicity while maintaining an average translation quality of 99.537; across 164 languages.

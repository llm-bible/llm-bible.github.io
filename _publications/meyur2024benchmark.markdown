In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
text generation, the emergence of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) presents
a promising avenue for improving the quality and reliability of generated text
by leveraging information retrieved from user specified database. Benchmarking
is essential to evaluate and compare the performance of the different RAG
configurations in terms of retriever and generator, providing insights into
their effectiveness, scalability, and suitability for the specific domain and
applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework to generate a
domain relevant RAG benchmark. Our framework is based on automatic
question-answer generation with Human (domain experts)-AI Large Language Model
(LLM) teaming. As a case study, we demonstrate the framework by introducing
WeQA, a first-of-its-kind benchmark on the wind energy domain which comprises
of multiple scientific documents/reports related to environmental impact of
wind energy projects. Our framework systematically evaluates RAG performance
using diverse metrics and multiple question types with varying complexity
level. We also demonstrate the performance of different models on our
benchmark.

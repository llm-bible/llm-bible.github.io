The emergence of an AI45;powered chatbot that can generate human45;like sentences and write coherent essays has caught the worlds attention. This paper discusses the historical overview of chatbots and the technology behind Chat Generative Pre45;trained Transformer better known as ChatGPT. Moreover potential applications of ChatGPT in various domains including healthcare education and research are highlighted. Despite promising results there are several privacy and ethical concerns surrounding ChatGPT. In addition we highlight some of the important limitations of the current version of ChatGPT. We also ask ChatGPT to provide its point of view and present its responses to several questions we attempt to answer.

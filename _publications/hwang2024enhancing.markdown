Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with processing extensive input contexts which can lead to redundant inaccurate or incoherent summaries. Recent methods have used unstructured memory to incrementally process these contexts but they still suffer from information overload due to the volume of unstructured data handled. In our study we introduce structured knowledge representations ((GU_json)) which significantly improve summarization performance by 4037; and 1437; across two public datasets. Most notably we propose the Chain-of-Key strategy ((CoK_json)) that dynamically updates or augments these representations with new information rather than recreating the structured memory for each new source. This method further enhances performance by 737; and 437; on the datasets.

Information extraction (IE) aims to extract structural knowledge from plain
natural language texts. Recently, generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text understanding and generation. As a
result, numerous works have been proposed to integrate LLMs for IE tasks based
on a generative paradigm. To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and
exploration of LLM efforts for IE tasks, in this study, we survey the most
recent advancements in this field. We first present an extensive overview by
categorizing these works in terms of various IE subtasks and techniques, and
then we empirically analyze the most advanced methods and discover the emerging
trend of IE tasks with LLMs. Based on a thorough review conducted, we identify
several insights in technique and promising research directions that deserve
further exploration in future studies. We maintain a public repository and
consistently update related works and resources on GitHub

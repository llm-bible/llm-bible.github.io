With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their outstanding performance in semantic and contextual comprehension the potential of LLMs in specialized domains warrants exploration. This paper introduces the NoteAid EHR Interaction Pipeline an innovative approach developed using generative LLMs to assist in patient education a task stemming from the need to aid patients in understanding Electronic Health Records (EHRs). Building upon the NoteAid work we designed two novel tasks from the patients perspective providing explanations for EHR content that patients may not understand and answering questions posed by patients after reading their EHRs. We extracted datasets containing 10000 instances from MIMIC Discharge Summaries and 876 instances from the MADE medical notes collection respectively executing the two tasks through the NoteAid EHR Interaction Pipeline with these data. Performance data of LLMs on these tasks were collected and constructed as the corresponding NoteAid EHR Interaction Dataset. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the entire dataset using LLM assessment and a rigorous manual evaluation of 64 instances we showcase the potential of LLMs in patient education. Besides the results provide valuable data support for future exploration and applications in this domain while also supplying high-quality synthetic datasets for in-house system training.

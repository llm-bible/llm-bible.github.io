Answering numerical questions over hybrid contents from the given tables and text(TextTableQA) is a challenging task. Recently Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the NLP community. With the emergence of large language models In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought prompting have become two particularly popular research topics in this field. In this paper we introduce a new prompting strategy called Hybrid prompt strategy and Retrieval of Thought for TextTableQA. Through In-Context Learning we prompt the model to develop the ability of retrieval thinking when dealing with hybrid data. Our method achieves superior performance compared to the fully-supervised SOTA on the MultiHiertt dataset in the few-shot setting.

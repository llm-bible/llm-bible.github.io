In recent years, large language models (LLMs) and generative AI have
revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), offering unprecedented
capabilities in education. This chapter explores the transformative potential
of LLMs in automated question generation and answer assessment. It begins by
examining the mechanisms behind LLMs, emphasizing their ability to comprehend
and generate human-like text. The chapter then discusses methodologies for
creating diverse, contextually relevant questions, enhancing learning through
tailored, adaptive strategies. Key prompting techniques, such as zero-shot and
chain-of-thought prompting, are evaluated for their effectiveness in generating
high-quality questions, including open-ended and multiple-choice formats in
various languages. Advanced NLP methods like fine-tuning and prompt-tuning are
explored for their role in generating task-specific questions, despite
associated costs. The chapter also covers the human evaluation of generated
questions, highlighting quality variations across different methods and areas
for improvement. Furthermore, it delves into automated answer assessment,
demonstrating how LLMs can accurately evaluate responses, provide constructive
feedback, and identify nuanced understanding or misconceptions. Examples
illustrate both successful assessments and areas needing improvement. The
discussion underscores the potential of LLMs to replace costly, time-consuming
human assessments when appropriately guided, showcasing their advanced
understanding and reasoning capabilities in streamlining educational processes.

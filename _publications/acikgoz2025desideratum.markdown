Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled conversational
AI from traditional dialogue systems into sophisticated agents capable of
autonomous actions, contextual awareness, and multi-turn interactions with
users. Yet, fundamental questions about their capabilities, limitations, and
paths forward remain open. This survey paper presents a desideratum for
next-generation Conversational Agents - what has been achieved, what challenges
persist, and what must be done for more scalable systems that approach
human-level intelligence. To that end, we systematically analyze LLM-driven
Conversational Agents by organizing their capabilities into three primary
dimensions: (i) Reasoning - logical, systematic thinking inspired by human
intelligence for decision making, (ii) Monitor - encompassing self-awareness
and user interaction monitoring, and (iii) Control - focusing on tool
utilization and policy following. Building upon this, we introduce a novel
taxonomy by classifying recent work on Conversational Agents around our
proposed desideratum. We identify critical research gaps and outline key
directions, including realistic evaluations, long-term multi-turn reasoning
skills, self-evolution capabilities, collaborative and multi-agent task
completion, personalization, and proactivity. This work aims to provide a
structured foundation, highlight existing limitations, and offer insights into
potential future research directions for Conversational Agents, ultimately
advancing progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). We maintain a

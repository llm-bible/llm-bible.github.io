Recent technological advances popularized the use of image generation among
the general public. Crafting effective prompts can, however, be difficult for
novice users. To tackle this challenge, we developed PromptMap, a new
interaction style for text-to-image AI that allows users to freely explore a
vast collection of synthetic prompts through a map-like view with semantic
zoom. PromptMap groups images visually by their semantic similarity, allowing
users to discover relevant examples. We evaluated PromptMap in a
between-subject online study (\\(n=60\\)) and a qualitative within-subject study
(\\(n=12\\)). We found that PromptMap supported users in crafting prompts by
providing them with examples. We also demonstrated the feasibility of using
LLMs to create vast example collections. Our work contributes a new interaction
style that supports users unfamiliar with prompting in achieving a satisfactory
image output.

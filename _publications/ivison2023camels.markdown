Since the release of TULU Wang et al. 2023b open resources for instruction tuning have developed quickly from better base models to new finetuning techniques. We test and incorporate a number of these advances into TULU resulting in TULU 2 a suite of improved TULU models for advancing the understanding and best practices of adapting pretrained language models to downstream tasks and user preferences. Concretely we release (1) TULU45;V245;mix an improved collection of high45;quality instruction datasets; (2) TULU 2 LLAMA45;2 models finetuned on the V2 mixture; (3) TULU 2+DPO TULU 2 models trained with direct preference optimization (DPO) including the largest DPO45;trained model to date (TULU 2+DPO 70B); (4) CODE TULU 2 CODE LLAMA models finetuned on our V2 mix that outperform CODE LLAMA and its instruction45;tuned variant CODE LLAMA45;Instruct. Our evaluation from multiple perspectives shows that the TULU 2 suite achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance among open models and matches or exceeds the performance of GPT45;3.545;turbo45;0301 on several benchmarks. We release all the checkpoints data training and evaluation code to facilitate future open efforts on adapting large language models.

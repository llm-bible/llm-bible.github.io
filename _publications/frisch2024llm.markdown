While both agent interaction and personalisation are vibrant topics in research on large language models (LLMs) there has been limited focus on the effect of language interaction on the behaviour of persona45;conditioned LLM agents. Such an endeavour is important to ensure that agents remain consistent to their assigned traits yet are able to engage in open naturalistic dialogues. In our experiments we condition GPT45;3.5 on personality profiles through prompting and create a two45;group population of LLM agents using a simple variability45;inducing sampling algorithm. We then administer personality tests and submit the agents to a collaborative writing task finding that different profiles exhibit different degrees of personality consistency and linguistic alignment to their conversational partners. Our study seeks to lay the groundwork for better understanding of dialogue45;based interaction between LLMs and highlights the need for new approaches to crafting robust more human45;like LLM personas for interactive environments.

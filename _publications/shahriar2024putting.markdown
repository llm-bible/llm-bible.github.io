As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance evaluating their comprehensive capabilities becomes significant for their application in various fields. This research study comprehensively evaluates the language vision speech and multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o. The study employs standardized exam questions reasoning tasks and translation assessments to assess the models language capability. Additionally GPT-4os vision and speech capabilities are tested through image classification and object recognition tasks as well as accent classification. The multimodal evaluation assesses the models performance in integrating visual and linguistic data. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o demonstrates high accuracy and efficiency across multiple domains in language and reasoning capabilities excelling in tasks that require few-shot learning. GPT-4o also provides notable improvements in multimodal tasks compared to its predecessors. However the model shows variability and faces limitations in handling complex and ambiguous inputs particularly in audio and vision capabilities. This paper highlights the need for more comprehensive benchmarks and robust evaluation frameworks encompassing qualitative assessments involving human judgment as well as error analysis. Future work should focus on expanding datasets investigating prompt-based assessment and enhancing few-shot learning techniques to test the models practical applicability and performance in real-world scenarios.

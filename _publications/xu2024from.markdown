In the realm of software development, providing accurate and personalized
code explanations is crucial for both technical professionals and business
stakeholders. Technical professionals benefit from enhanced understanding and
improved problem-solving skills, while business stakeholders gain insights into
project alignments and transparency. Despite the potential, generating such
explanations is often time-consuming and challenging. This paper presents an
innovative approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) to generate faithful and personalized code explanations. Our
methodology integrates prompt enhancement, self-correction mechanisms,
personalized content customization, and interaction with external tools,
facilitated by collaboration among multiple LLM agents. We evaluate our
approach using both automatic and human assessments, demonstrating that our
method not only produces accurate explanations but also tailors them to
individual user preferences. Our findings suggest that this approach
significantly improves the quality and relevance of code explanations, offering
a valuable tool for developers and stakeholders alike.

In this paper we introduce Concise Chain-of-Thought (CCoT) prompting. We compared standard CoT and CCoT prompts to see how conciseness impacts response length and correct-answer accuracy. We evaluated this using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 with a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) benchmark. CCoT reduced average response length by 48.7037; for both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 while having a negligible impact on problem-solving performance. However on math problems GPT-3.5 with CCoT incurs a performance penalty of 27.6937;. Overall CCoT leads to an average per-token cost reduction of 22.6737;.

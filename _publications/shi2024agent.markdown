The relation extraction (RE) in complex scenarios faces challenges such as diverse relation types and ambiguous relations between entities within a single sentence leading to the poor performance of pure text45;in text45;out language models (LMs). To address these challenges in this paper we propose an agent45;based RE framework namely AgentRE which fully leverages the potential of large language models (LLMs) including memory retrieval and reflection to achieve RE in complex scenarios. Specifically three major modules are built in AgentRE serving as the tools to help the agent acquire and process various useful information thereby obtaining improved RE performance. Our extensive experimental results upon two datasets in English and Chinese demonstrate our AgentREs superior performance especially in low45;resource scenarios. Additionally the trajectories generated by AgentRE can be refined to construct a high45;quality training dataset incorporating different reasoning methods which can be used to fine45;tune smaller models. Code is available at https://github.com/Lightblues/AgentRE.

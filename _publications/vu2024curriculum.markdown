Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong in-context learning (ICL)
abilities with a few demonstrations. However, one critical challenge is how to
select demonstrations to elicit the full potential of LLMs. In this paper, we
propose Curriculum Demonstration Selection (CDS), a novel demonstration
selection method for ICL. Instead of merely using similarity, CDS additionally
partitions samples by their complexity measurements. Following curriculum
learning, CDS then selects demonstrations from easy to difficult. Thus the
selected demonstrations cover a wide range of difficulty levels, enabling LLMs
to learn from varied complexities within the training set. Experiments
demonstrate that our CDS consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving
notable improvements across nine LLMs on three benchmarks. Moreover, CDS proves
especially effective in enhancing LLM performance in solving challenging
problems.

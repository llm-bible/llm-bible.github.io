AI intent alignment, ensuring that AI produces outcomes as intended by users,
is a critical challenge in human-AI interaction. The emergence of generative
AI, including LLMs, has intensified the significance of this problem, as
interactions increasingly involve users specifying desired results for AI
systems. In order to support better AI intent alignment, we aim to explore
human strategies for intent specification in human-human communication. By
studying and comparing human-human and human-LLM communication, we identify key
strategies that can be applied to the design of AI systems that are more
effective at understanding and aligning with user intent. This study aims to
advance toward a human-centered AI system by bringing together human
communication strategies for the design of AI systems.

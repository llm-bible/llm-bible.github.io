This paper explores the image45;sharing capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT45;4 and LLaMA 2 in a zero45;shot setting. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs we introduce the PhotoChat++ dataset which includes enriched annotations (i.e. intent triggering sentence image description and salient information). Furthermore we present the gradient45;free and extensible Decide Describe and Retrieve (DribeR) framework. With extensive experiments we unlock the image45;sharing capability of DribeR equipped with LLMs in zero45;shot prompting with ChatGPT achieving the best performance. Our findings also reveal the emergent image45;sharing ability in LLMs under zero45;shot conditions validating the effectiveness of DribeR. We use this framework to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness in two real45;world scenarios (1) human45;bot interaction and (2) dataset augmentation. To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the image45;sharing ability of various LLMs in a zero45;shot setting. We make our source code and dataset publicly available at https://github.com/passing2961/DribeR.

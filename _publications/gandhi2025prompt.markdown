The rise of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language
processing (NLP), yet the influence of prompt sentiment, a latent affective
characteristic of input text, remains underexplored. This study systematically
examines how sentiment variations in prompts affect LLM-generated outputs in
terms of coherence, factuality, and bias. Leveraging both lexicon-based and
transformer-based sentiment analysis methods, we categorize prompts and
evaluate responses from five leading LLMs: Claude, DeepSeek, GPT-4, Gemini, and
LLaMA. Our analysis spans six AI-driven applications, including content
generation, conversational AI, legal and financial analysis, healthcare AI,
creative writing, and technical documentation. By transforming prompts, we
assess their impact on output quality. Our findings reveal that prompt
sentiment significantly influences model responses, with negative prompts often
reducing factual accuracy and amplifying bias, while positive prompts tend to
increase verbosity and sentiment propagation. These results highlight the
importance of sentiment-aware prompt engineering for ensuring fair and reliable
AI-generated content.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising method for addressing
some of the memory-related challenges associated with Large Language Models
(LLMs). Two separate systems form the RAG pipeline, the retriever and the
reader, and the impact of each on downstream task performance is not
well-understood. Here, we work towards the goal of understanding how retrievers
can be optimized for RAG pipelines for common tasks such as Question Answering
(QA). We conduct experiments focused on the relationship between retrieval and
RAG performance on QA and attributed QA and unveil a number of insights useful
to practitioners developing high-performance RAG pipelines. For example,
lowering search accuracy has minor implications for RAG performance while
potentially increasing retrieval speed and memory efficiency.

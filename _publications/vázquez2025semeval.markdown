We present the Mu-SHROOM shared task which is focused on detecting
hallucinations and other overgeneration mistakes in the output of
instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). Mu-SHROOM addresses
general-purpose LLMs in 14 languages, and frames the hallucination detection
problem as a span-labeling task. We received 2,618 submissions from 43
participating teams employing diverse methodologies. The large number of
submissions underscores the interest of the community in hallucination
detection. We present the results of the participating systems and conduct an
empirical analysis to identify key factors contributing to strong performance
in this task. We also emphasize relevant current challenges, notably the
varying degree of hallucinations across languages and the high annotator
disagreement when labeling hallucination spans.

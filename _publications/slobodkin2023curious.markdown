Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to possess impressive capabilities while also raising crucial concerns about the faithfulness of their responses. A primary issue arising in this context is the management of (un)answerable queries by LLMs which often results in hallucinatory behavior due to overconfidence. In this paper we explore the behavior of LLMs when presented with (un)answerable queries. We ask do models represent the fact that the question is (un)answerable when generating a hallucinatory answer Our results show strong indications that such models encode the answerability of an input query with the representation of the first decoded token often being a strong indicator. These findings shed new light on the spatial organization within the latent representations of LLMs unveiling previously unexplored facets of these models. Moreover they pave the way for the development of improved decoding techniques with better adherence to factual generation particularly in scenarios where query (un)answerability is a concern.

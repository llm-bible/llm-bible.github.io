Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents have emerged as promising
protocols for automatically understanding the language-based environment,
particularly with the exponential development of large language models (LLMs).
However, a fine-grained, comprehensive understanding of multimodal environments
remains under-explored. This work designs an autonomous workflow tailored for
integrating AI agents seamlessly into extended reality (XR) applications for
fine-grained training. We present a demonstration of a multimodal fine-grained
training assistant for LEGO brick assembly in a pilot XR environment.
Specifically, we design a cerebral language agent that integrates LLM with
memory, planning, and interaction with XR tools and a vision-language agent,
enabling agents to decide their actions based on past experiences. Furthermore,
we introduce LEGO-MRTA, a multimodal fine-grained assembly dialogue dataset
synthesized automatically in the workflow served by a commercial LLM. This
dataset comprises multimodal instruction manuals, conversations, XR responses,
and vision question answering. Last, we present several prevailing
open-resource LLMs as benchmarks, assessing their performance with and without
fine-tuning on the proposed dataset. We anticipate that the broader impact of
this workflow will advance the development of smarter assistants for seamless
user interaction in XR environments, fostering research in both AI and HCI
communities.

Stochastic embedding transitions introduce a probabilistic mechanism for
adjusting token representations dynamically during inference, mitigating the
constraints imposed through static or deterministic embeddings. A transition
framework was proposed in which each token embedding evolved through
probabilistic updates, ensuring adaptability while preserving semantic
integrity across linguistic contexts. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that
models incorporating stochastic transitions exhibited greater lexical
diversity, improved generative coherence, and enhanced retention of
low-frequency vocabulary, contributing to more varied sentence structures and
reduced reliance on high-probability token selections. Statistical analyses of
embedding drift across transformer layers indicated that representations
evolved more flexibly without losing coherence, supporting the hypothesis that
controlled stochasticity facilitated context-sensitive representation learning.
Experimental results revealed that probabilistic embeddings introduced minor
computational overhead while maintaining generative efficiency, reinforcing
their feasibility in large-scale applications. A comparative study with
traditional embedding approaches highlighted measurable gains in text
completion accuracy, dialogue coherence, and structural complexity, confirming
the effectiveness of stochastic transitions in enhancing representation
expressiveness. Clustering patterns in the embedding space suggested that
probabilistic updates preserved meaningful semantic groupings while enabling
context-driven shifts, further validating the stability of the transition
mechanism. Performance metrics indicated that stochastic transitions balanced
adaptability and control, ensuring that generative outputs remained
linguistically coherent without excessive randomness.

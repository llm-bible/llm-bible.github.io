While the field of NL2SQL has made significant advancements in translating natural language instructions into executable SQL scripts for data querying and processing achieving full automation within the broader data science pipeline 45; encompassing data querying analysis visualization and reporting 45; remains a complex challenge. This study introduces SageCopilot an advanced industry45;grade system system that automates the data science pipeline by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) Autonomous Agents (AutoAgents) and Language User Interfaces (LUIs). Specifically SageCopilot incorporates a two45;phase design an online component refining users inputs into executable scripts through In45;Context Learning (ICL) and running the scripts for results reporting amp; visualization and an offline preparing demonstrations requested by ICL in the online phase. A list of trending strategies such as Chain45;of45;Thought and prompt45;tuning have been used to augment SageCopilot for enhanced performance. Through rigorous testing and comparative analysis against prompt45;based solutions SageCopilot has been empirically validated to achieve superior end45;to45;end performance in generating or executing scripts and offering results with visualization backed by real45;world datasets. Our in45;depth ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of various components and strategies used by SageCopilot to the end45;to45;end correctness for data sciences.

We present our system submission for SemEval 2025 Task 5, which focuses on
cross-lingual subject classification in the English and German academic
domains. Our approach leverages bilingual data during training, employing
negative sampling and a margin-based retrieval objective. We demonstrate that a
dimension-as-token self-attention mechanism designed with significantly reduced
internal dimensions can effectively encode sentence embeddings for subject
retrieval. In quantitative evaluation, our system achieved an average recall
rate of 32.24% in the general quantitative setting (all subjects), 43.16% and
31.53% of the general qualitative evaluation methods with minimal GPU usage,
highlighting their competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that our
approach is effective in capturing relevant subject information under resource
constraints, although there is still room for improvement.

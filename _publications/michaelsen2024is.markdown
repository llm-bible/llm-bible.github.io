Background The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into daily life particularly through chatbots utilizing natural language processing (NLP) presents both revolutionary potential and unique challenges. This intended to investigate how different input forms impact ChatGPT a leading language model by OpenAI performance in understanding and executing complex multi-intention tasks. Design Employing a case study methodology supplemented by discourse analysis the research analyzes ChatGPTs responses to inputs varying from natural language to pseudo-code engineering. The study specifically examines the models proficiency across four categories understanding of intentions interpretability completeness and creativity. Setting and Participants As a theoretical exploration of AI interaction this study focuses on the analysis of structured and unstructured inputs processed by ChatGPT without direct human participants. Data collection and analysis The research utilizes synthetic case scenarios including the organization of a weekly meal plan and a shopping list to assess ChatGPTs response to prompts in both natural language and pseudo-code engineering. The analysis is grounded in the identification of patterns contradictions and unique response elements across different input formats. Results Findings reveal that pseudo-code engineering inputs significantly enhance the clarity and determinism of ChatGPTs responses reducing ambiguity inherent in natural language. Enhanced natural language structured through prompt engineering techniques similarly improves the models interpretability and creativity. Conclusions The study underscores the potential of pseudo-code engineering in refining human-AI interaction and achieving more deterministic concise and direct outcomes advocating for its broader application across disciplines requiring precise AI responses.

This study explores the proactive ability of LLMs to seek user support. We
propose metrics to evaluate the trade-off between performance improvements and
user burden, and investigate whether LLMs can determine when to request help
under varying information availability. Our experiments show that without
external feedback, many LLMs struggle to recognize their need for user support.
The findings highlight the importance of external signals and provide insights
for future research on improving support-seeking strategies. Source code:

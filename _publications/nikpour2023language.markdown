Attention mechanisms have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing
learning models by identifying key portions of input data, particularly in
scenarios with limited training samples. Inspired by human perception, we
propose that focusing on essential data segments, rather than the entire
dataset, can improve the accuracy and reliability of the learning models.
However, identifying these critical data segments, or "hard attention finding,"
is challenging, especially in few-shot learning, due to the scarcity of
training data and the complexity of model parameters. To address this, we
introduce LaHA, a novel framework that leverages language-guided deep
reinforcement learning to identify and utilize informative data regions,
thereby improving both interpretability and performance. Extensive experiments
on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of LaHA.

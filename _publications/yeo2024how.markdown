Prompt Engineering has garnered significant attention for enhancing the performance of large language models across a multitude of tasks. Techniques such as the Chain-of-Thought not only bolster task performance but also delineate a clear trajectory of reasoning steps offering a tangible form of explanation for the audience. Prior works on interpretability assess the reasoning chains yielded by Chain-of-Thought solely along a singular axis namely faithfulness. We present a comprehensive and multifaceted evaluation of interpretability examining not only faithfulness but also robustness and utility across multiple commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Likewise our investigation is not confined to a single prompting technique; it expansively covers a multitude of prevalent prompting techniques employed in large language models thereby ensuring a wide-ranging and exhaustive evaluation. In addition we introduce a simple interpretability alignment technique termed Self-Entailment-Alignment Chain-of-thought that yields more than 7037; improvements across multiple dimensions of interpretability.

Query understanding in Conversational Information Seeking (CIS) involves
accurately interpreting user intent through context-aware interactions. This
includes resolving ambiguities, refining queries, and adapting to evolving
information needs. Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance this process by
interpreting nuanced language and adapting dynamically, improving the relevance
and precision of search results in real-time. In this tutorial, we explore
advanced techniques to enhance query understanding in LLM-based CIS systems. We
delve into LLM-driven methods for developing robust evaluation metrics to
assess query understanding quality in multi-turn interactions, strategies for
building more interactive systems, and applications like proactive query
management and query reformulation. We also discuss key challenges in
integrating LLMs for query understanding in conversational search systems and
outline future research directions. Our goal is to deepen the audience's
understanding of LLM-based conversational query understanding and inspire
discussions to drive ongoing advancements in this field.

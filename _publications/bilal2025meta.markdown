This survey explores the development of meta-thinking capabilities in Large
Language Models (LLMs) from a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
perspective. Meta-thinking self-reflection, assessment, and control of thinking
processes is an important next step in enhancing LLM reliability, flexibility,
and performance, particularly for complex or high-stakes tasks. The survey
begins by analyzing current LLM limitations, such as hallucinations and the
lack of internal self-assessment mechanisms. It then talks about newer methods,
including RL from human feedback (RLHF), self-distillation, and
chain-of-thought prompting, and each of their limitations. The crux of the
survey is to talk about how multi-agent architectures, namely supervisor-agent
hierarchies, agent debates, and theory of mind frameworks, can emulate
human-like introspective behavior and enhance LLM robustness. By exploring
reward mechanisms, self-play, and continuous learning methods in MARL, this
survey gives a comprehensive roadmap to building introspective, adaptive, and
trustworthy LLMs. Evaluation metrics, datasets, and future research avenues,
including neuroscience-inspired architectures and hybrid symbolic reasoning,
are also discussed.

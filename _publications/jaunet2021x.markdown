Visual Question Answering systems target answering open45;ended textual questions given input images. They are a testbed for learning high45;level reasoning with a primary use in HCI for instance assistance for the visually impaired. Recent research has shown that state45;of45;the45;art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data and sometimes do not even look at the input image instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state45;of45;the45;art neural models 45;45; attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well45;known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision45;language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First as a result of a collaboration of three fields machine learning vision and language reasoning and data analytics the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second we also report on the design of VisQA and a goal45;oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.

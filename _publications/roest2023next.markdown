Large Language Models possess skills such as answering questions writing essays or solving programming exercises. Since these models are easily accessible researchers have investigated their capabilities and risks for programming education. This work explores how LLMs can contribute to programming education by supporting students with automated next45;step hints. We investigate prompt practices that lead to effective next45;step hints and use these insights to build our StAP45;tutor. We evaluate this tutor by conducting an experiment with students and performing expert assessments. Our findings show that most LLM45;generated feedback messages describe one specific next step and are personalised to the students code and approach. However the hints may contain misleading information and lack sufficient detail when students approach the end of the assignment. This work demonstrates the potential for LLM45;generated feedback but further research is required to explore its practical implementation.

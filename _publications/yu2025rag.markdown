This paper presents RAG-KG-IL, a novel multi-agent hybrid framework designed
to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by
integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs)
with an Incremental Learning (IL) approach. Despite recent advancements, LLMs
still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling
dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in
mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these
limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous
knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous
agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to
ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while
KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of
understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to
the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing
computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the
framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries,
comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces
hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy.
The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent
systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge
integration and reasoning in complex domains.

Recently improving the relevance and diversity of dialogue system has attracted wide attention. For a post x the corresponding response y is usually diverse in the real45;world corpus while the conventional encoder45;decoder model tends to output the high45;frequency (safe but trivial) responses and thus is difficult to handle the large number of responding styles. To address these issues we propose the Atom Responding Machine (ARM) which is based on a proposed encoder45;composer45;decoder network trained by a teacher45;student framework. To enrich the generated responses ARM introduces a large number of molecule45;mechanisms as various responding styles which are conducted by taking different combinations from a few atom45;mechanisms. In other words even a little of atom45;mechanisms can make a mickle of molecule45;mechanisms. The experiments demonstrate diversity and quality of the responses generated by ARM. We also present generating process to show underlying interpretability for the result.

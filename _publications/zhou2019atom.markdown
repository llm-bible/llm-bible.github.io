Recently improving the relevance and diversity of dialogue system has attracted wide attention. For a post x the corresponding response y is usually diverse in the real-world corpus while the conventional encoder-decoder model tends to output the high-frequency (safe but trivial) responses and thus is difficult to handle the large number of responding styles. To address these issues we propose the Atom Responding Machine (ARM) which is based on a proposed encoder-composer-decoder network trained by a teacher-student framework. To enrich the generated responses ARM introduces a large number of molecule-mechanisms as various responding styles which are conducted by taking different combinations from a few atom-mechanisms. In other words even a little of atom-mechanisms can make a mickle of molecule-mechanisms. The experiments demonstrate diversity and quality of the responses generated by ARM. We also present generating process to show underlying interpretability for the result.

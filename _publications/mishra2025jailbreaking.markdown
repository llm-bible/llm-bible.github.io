The rapid advancements in generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, have
introduced both significant benefits and new risks within the cybersecurity
landscape. This paper investigates the potential misuse of the latest AI model,
ChatGPT-4o Mini, in facilitating social engineering attacks, with a particular
focus on phishing, one of the most pressing cybersecurity threats today. While
existing literature primarily addresses the technical aspects, such as
jailbreaking techniques, none have fully explored the free and straightforward
execution of a comprehensive phishing campaign by novice users using ChatGPT-4o
Mini. In this study, we examine the vulnerabilities of AI-driven chatbot
services in 2025, specifically how methods like jailbreaking and reverse
psychology can bypass ethical safeguards, allowing ChatGPT to generate phishing
content, suggest hacking tools, and assist in carrying out phishing attacks.
Our findings underscore the alarming ease with which even inexperienced users
can execute sophisticated phishing campaigns, emphasizing the urgent need for
stronger cybersecurity measures and heightened user awareness in the age of AI.

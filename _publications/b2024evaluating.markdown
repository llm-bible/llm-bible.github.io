This paper presents an analysis of open-source large language models (LLMs) and their application in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks specific for enterprise-specific data sets scraped from their websites. With the increasing reliance on LLMs in natural language processing it is crucial to evaluate their performance accessibility and integration within specific organizational contexts. This study examines various open-source LLMs explores their integration into RAG frameworks using enterprise-specific data and assesses the performance of different open-source embeddings in enhancing the retrieval and generation process. Our findings indicate that open-source LLMs combined with effective embedding techniques can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of RAG systems offering a viable alternative to proprietary solutions for enterprises.

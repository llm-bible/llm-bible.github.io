In response to the escalating cyber-attacks in the modern IT and IoT landscape we developed CYGENT a conversational agent framework powered by GPT-3.5 turbo model designed to aid system administrators in ensuring optimal performance and uninterrupted resource availability. This study focuses on fine-tuning GPT-3 models for cybersecurity tasks including conversational AI and generative AI tailored specifically for cybersecurity operations. CYGENT assists users by providing cybersecurity information analyzing and summarizing uploaded log files detecting specific events and delivering essential instructions. The conversational agent was developed based on the GPT-3.5 turbo model. We fine-tuned and validated summarizer models (GPT3) using manually generated data points. Using this approach we achieved a BERTscore of over 9737; indicating GPT-3s enhanced capability in summarizing log files into human-readable formats and providing necessary information to users. Furthermore we conducted a comparative analysis of GPT-3 models with other Large Language Models (LLMs) including CodeT5-small CodeT5-base and CodeT5-base-multi-sum with the objective of analyzing log analysis techniques. Our analysis consistently demonstrated that Davinci (GPT-3) model outperformed all other LLMs showcasing higher performance. These findings are crucial for improving human comprehension of logs particularly in light of the increasing numbers of IoT devices. Additionally our research suggests that the CodeT5-base-multi-sum model exhibits comparable performance to Davinci to some extent in summarizing logs indicating its potential as an offline model for this task.

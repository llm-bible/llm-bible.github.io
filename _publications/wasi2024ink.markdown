Individuality and personalization comprise the distinctive characteristics
that make each writer unique and influence their words in order to effectively
engage readers while conveying authenticity. However, our growing reliance on
LLM-based writing assistants risks compromising our creativity and
individuality over time. We often overlook the negative impacts of this trend
on our creativity and uniqueness, despite the possible consequences. This study
investigates these concerns by performing a brief survey to explore different
perspectives and concepts, as well as trying to understand people's viewpoints,
in conjunction with past studies in the area. Addressing these issues is
essential for improving human-computer interaction systems and enhancing
writing assistants for personalization and individuality.

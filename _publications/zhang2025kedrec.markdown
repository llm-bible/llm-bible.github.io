Drug discovery is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing
(NLP), yet explainable drug discovery remains underexplored. Meanwhile, large
language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities in natural language
understanding and generation. Leveraging LLMs for explainable drug discovery
has the potential to improve downstream tasks and real-world applications. In
this study, we utilize open-source drug knowledge graphs, clinical trial data,
and PubMed publications to construct a comprehensive dataset for the
explainable drug discovery task, named \textbf\{expRxRec\}. Furthermore, we
introduce \textbf\{KEDRec-LM\}, an instruction-tuned LLM which distills knowledge
from rich medical knowledge corpus for drug recommendation and rationale
generation. To encourage further research in this area, we will publicly
release\footnote\{A copy is attached with this submission\} both the dataset and
KEDRec-LM.

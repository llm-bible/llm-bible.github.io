Dialogic learning fosters motivation and deeper understanding in education
through purposeful and structured dialogues. Foundational models offer a
transformative potential for child-robot interactions, enabling the design of
personalized, engaging, and scalable interactions. However, their integration
into educational contexts presents challenges in terms of ensuring
age-appropriate and safe content and alignment with pedagogical goals. We
introduce a hybrid approach to designing personalized educational dialogues in
child-robot interactions. By combining rule-based systems with LLMs for
selective offline content generation and human validation, the framework
ensures educational quality and developmental appropriateness. We illustrate
this approach through a project aimed at enhancing reading motivation, in which
a robot facilitated book-related dialogues.

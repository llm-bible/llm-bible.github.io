Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in understanding
and generating natural language across various applications. However, they
often struggle with resolving ambiguities in real-world, enterprise-level
interactions, where context and domain-specific knowledge play a crucial role.
In this demonstration, we introduce ECLAIR (Enhanced CLArification for
Interactive Responses), a multi-agent framework for interactive disambiguation.
ECLAIR enhances ambiguous user query clarification through an interactive
process where custom agents are defined, ambiguity reasoning is conducted by
the agents, clarification questions are generated, and user feedback is
leveraged to refine the final response. When tested on real-world customer
data, ECLAIR demonstrates significant improvements in clarification question
generation compared to standard few-shot methods.

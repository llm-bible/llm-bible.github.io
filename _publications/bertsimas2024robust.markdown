In this paper, we explore the application of ChatGPT in the domain of Robust
and Adaptive Robust Optimization. We demonstrate that with appropriate
prompting, ChatGPT can be used to auto-formulate and solve simple Robust and
Adaptive Optimization Problems. We first develop specialized informational
prompts tailored to the domains of Adaptive and Robust Optimization. Then, we
show that using these prompts, ChatGPT is able to (i) formulate an optimization
problem, (ii) adapt the problem so that it accounts for user-specified
uncertainty, (iii) derive the computationally tractable robust counterpart of
the problem and (iv) produce executable code that solves the problem. For
simple Optimization Problems, we show that ChatGPT is able to perform these
steps with little to no errors. We also highlight some instances of erroneous
execution of the steps. Overall, we show that using in-context learning,
ChatGPT has the potential to adapt to higlhy specialized and niche domains, in
which it would otherwise demonstrate very poor out-of-the-box performance.

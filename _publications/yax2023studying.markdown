In the present study we investigate and compare reasoning in large language models (LLM) and humans using a selection of cognitive psychology tools traditionally dedicated to the study of (bounded) rationality. To do so we presented to human participants and an array of pretrained LLMs new variants of classical cognitive experiments and cross-compared their performances. Our results showed that most of the included models presented reasoning errors akin to those frequently ascribed to error-prone heuristic-based human reasoning. Notwithstanding this superficial similarity an in-depth comparison between humans and LLMs indicated important differences with human-like reasoning with models limitations disappearing almost entirely in more recent LLMs releases. Moreover we show that while it is possible to devise strategies to induce better performance humans and machines are not equally-responsive to the same prompting schemes. We conclude by discussing the epistemological implications and challenges of comparing human and machine behavior for both artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology.

Humans can attribute beliefs to others. However it is unknown to what extent this ability results from an innate biological endowment or from experience accrued through child development particularly exposure to language describing others mental states. We test the viability of the language exposure hypothesis by assessing whether models exposed to large quantities of human language display sensitivity to the implied knowledge states of characters in written passages. In pre-registered analyses we present a linguistic version of the False Belief Task to both human participants and a Large Language Model GPT-3. Both are sensitive to others beliefs but while the language model significantly exceeds chance behavior it does not perform as well as the humans nor does it explain the full extent of their behavior -- despite being exposed to more language than a human would in a lifetime. This suggests that while statistical learning from language exposure may in part explain how humans develop the ability to reason about the mental states of others other mechanisms are also responsible.

This paper introduces a novel modification of the transformer architecture,
tailored for the data-efficient pretraining of language models. This aspect is
evaluated by participating in the BabyLM challenge, where our solution won both
the strict and strict-small tracks. Our approach allows each transformer layer
to select which outputs of previous layers to process. The empirical results
verify the potential of this simple modification and show that not all layers
are equally as important.

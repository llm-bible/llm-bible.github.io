Large language models (LLMs) are displaying emergent abilities for math reasoning tasksand there is a growing attention on enhancing the ability of open-source LLMs through supervised fine-tuning (SFT).In this paper we aim to explore a general data strategy for supervised data to help optimize and expand math reasoning ability.Firstly we determine the ability boundary of reasoning paths augmentation by identifying these paths minimal optimal set.Secondly we validate that different abilities of the model can be cumulatively enhanced by Mix of Minimal Optimal Sets of corresponding types of data while our models MMOS achieve SOTA performance on series base models under much lower construction costs.Besides we point out GSM-HARD is not really hard and todays LLMs no longer lack numerical robustness.Also we provide an Auto Problem Generator for robustness testing and educational applications.Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/cyzhh/MMOS."

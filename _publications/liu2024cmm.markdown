Large language models (LLMs) have obtained promising results in mathematical reasoning which is a foundational skill for human intelligence. Most previous studies focus on improving and measuring the performance of LLMs based on textual math reasoning datasets (e.g. MATH GSM8K). Recently a few researchers have released English multimodal math datasets (e.g. MATHVISTA and MATH45;V) to evaluate the effectiveness of large multimodal models (LMMs). In this paper we release a Chinese multimodal math (CMM45;Math) dataset including benchmark and training parts to evaluate and enhance the mathematical reasoning of LMMs. CMM45;Math contains over 28000 high45;quality samples featuring a variety of problem types (e.g. multiple45;choice fill45;in45;the45;blank and so on) with detailed solutions across 12 grade levels from elementary to high school in China. Specifically the visual context may be present in the questions or opinions which makes this dataset more challenging. Through comprehensive analysis we discover that state45;of45;the45;art LMMs on the CMM45;Math dataset face challenges emphasizing the necessity for further improvements in LMM development. We also propose a Multimodal Mathematical LMM (Math45;LMM) to handle the problems with mixed input of multiple images and text segments. We train our model using three stages including foundational pre45;training foundational fine45;tuning and mathematical fine45;tuning. The extensive experiments indicate that our model effectively improves math reasoning performance by comparing it with the SOTA LMMs over three multimodal mathematical datasets.

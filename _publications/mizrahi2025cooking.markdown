Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at countless tasks, yet struggle with
creativity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that couples LLMs with
structured representations and cognitively inspired manipulations to generate
more creative and diverse ideas. Our notion of creativity goes beyond
superficial token-level variations; rather, we explicitly recombine structured
representations of existing ideas, allowing our algorithm to effectively
explore the more abstract landscape of ideas. We demonstrate our approach in
the culinary domain with DishCOVER, a model that generates creative recipes.
Experiments comparing our model's results to those of GPT-4o show greater
diversity. Domain expert evaluations reveal that our outputs, which are mostly
coherent and feasible culinary creations, significantly surpass GPT-4o in terms
of novelty, thus outperforming it in creative generation. We hope our work
inspires further research into structured creativity in AI.

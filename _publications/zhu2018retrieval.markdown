Dialogue systems are usually built on either generation-based or
retrieval-based approaches, yet they do not benefit from the advantages of
different models. In this paper, we propose a Retrieval-Enhanced Adversarial
Training (REAT) method for neural response generation. Distinct from existing
approaches, the REAT method leverages an encoder-decoder framework in terms of
an adversarial training paradigm, while taking advantage of N-best response
candidates from a retrieval-based system to construct the discriminator. An
empirical study on a large scale public available benchmark dataset shows that
the REAT method significantly outperforms the vanilla Seq2Seq model as well as
the conventional adversarial training approach.

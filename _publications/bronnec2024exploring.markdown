We introduce a novel evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as and focusing on importing Precision and Recall metrics from image generation to text generation. This approach allows for a nuanced assessment of the quality and diversity of generated text without the need for aligned corpora. By conducting a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art language models the study reveals new insights into their performance on open-ended generation tasks which are not adequately captured by traditional benchmarks. The findings highlight a trade-off between the quality and diversity of generated samples particularly when models are fine-tuned on instruction dataset or with human feedback. This work extends the toolkit for distribution-based NLP evaluation offering insights into the practical capabilities and challenges that current LLMs face in generating diverse and high-quality text. We release our code and data.

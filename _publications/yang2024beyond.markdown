Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in the medical
domain for their human-level capabilities, leading to increased efforts to
explore their potential in various healthcare applications. However, despite
such a promising future, there are multiple challenges and obstacles that
remain for their real-world uses in practical settings. This work discusses key
challenges for LLMs in medical applications from four unique aspects:
operational vulnerabilities, ethical and social considerations, performance and
assessment difficulties, and legal and regulatory compliance. Addressing these
challenges is crucial for leveraging LLMs to their full potential and ensuring
their responsible integration into healthcare.

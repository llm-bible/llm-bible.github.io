Knowledge45;Intensive Visual Question Answering (KI45;VQA) refers to answering a question about an image whose answer does not lie in the image. This paper presents a new pipeline for KI45;VQA tasks consisting of a retriever and a reader. First we introduce DEDR a symmetric dual encoding dense retrieval framework in which documents and queries are encoded into a shared embedding space using uni45;modal (textual) and multi45;modal encoders. We introduce an iterative knowledge distillation approach that bridges the gap between the representation spaces in these two encoders. Extensive evaluation on two well45;established KI45;VQA datasets i.e. OK45;VQA and FVQA suggests that DEDR outperforms state45;of45;the45;art baselines by 11.637; and 30.937; on OK45;VQA and FVQA respectively. Utilizing the passages retrieved by DEDR we further introduce MM45;FiD an encoder45;decoder multi45;modal fusion45;in45;decoder model for generating a textual answer for KI45;VQA tasks. MM45;FiD encodes the question the image and each retrieved passage separately and uses all passages jointly in its decoder. Compared to competitive baselines in the literature this approach leads to 5.537; and 8.537; improvements in terms of question answering accuracy on OK45;VQA and FVQA respectively.

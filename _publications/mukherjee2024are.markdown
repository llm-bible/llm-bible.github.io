We analyze the performance of large language models (LLMs) on Text Style Transfer (TST) specifically focusing on sentiment transfer and text detoxification across three languages English Hindi and Bengali. Text Style Transfer involves modifying the linguistic style of a text while preserving its core content. We evaluate the capabilities of pre45;trained LLMs using zero45;shot and few45;shot prompting as well as parameter45;efficient finetuning on publicly available datasets. Our evaluation using automatic metrics GPT45;4 and human evaluations reveals that while some prompted LLMs perform well in English their performance in on other languages (Hindi Bengali) remains average. However finetuning significantly improves results compared to zero45;shot and few45;shot prompting making them comparable to previous state45;of45;the45;art. This underscores the necessity of dedicated datasets and specialized models for effective TST.

Pretrained language models have led to significant performance gains in many NLP tasks. However the intensive computing resources to train such models remain an issue. Knowledge distillation alleviates this problem by learning a light-weight student model. So far the distillation approaches are all task-specific. In this paper we explore knowledge distillation under the multi-task learning setting. The student is jointly distilled across different tasks. It acquires more general representation capacity through multi-tasking distillation and can be further fine-tuned to improve the model in the target domain. Unlike other BERT distillation methods which specifically designed for Transformer-based architectures we provide a general learning framework. Our approach is model agnostic and can be easily applied on different future teacher model architectures. We evaluate our approach on a Transformer-based and LSTM based student model. Compared to a strong similarly LSTM-based approach we achieve better quality under the same computational constraints. Compared to the present state of the art we reach comparable results with much faster inference speed.

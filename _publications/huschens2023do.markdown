This paper examines how individuals perceive the credibility of content
originating from human authors versus content generated by large language
models, like the GPT language model family that powers ChatGPT, in different
user interface versions. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that regardless
of the user interface presentation, participants tend to attribute similar
levels of credibility. While participants also do not report any different
perceptions of competence and trustworthiness between human and AI-generated
content, they rate AI-generated content as being clearer and more engaging. The
findings from this study serve as a call for a more discerning approach to
evaluating information sources, encouraging users to exercise caution and
critical thinking when engaging with content generated by AI systems.

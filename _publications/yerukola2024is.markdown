Humans often express their communicative intents indirectly or non45;literally which requires their interlocutors 45;45; human or AI 45;45; to understand beyond the literal meaning of words. While most existing work has focused on discriminative evaluations we present a new approach to generatively evaluate large language models (LLMs) intention understanding by examining their responses to non45;literal utterances. Ideally an LLM should respond in line with the true intention of a non45;literal utterance not its literal interpretation. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to generate pragmatically relevant responses to non45;literal language achieving only 5045;5537; accuracy on average. While explicitly providing oracle intentions significantly improves performance (e.g. 7537; for Mistral45;Instruct) this still indicates challenges in leveraging given intentions to produce appropriate responses. Using chain45;of45;thought to make models spell out intentions yields much smaller gains (6037; for Mistral45;Instruct). These findings suggest that LLMs are not yet effective pragmatic interlocutors highlighting the need for better approaches for modeling intentions and utilizing them for pragmatic generation.

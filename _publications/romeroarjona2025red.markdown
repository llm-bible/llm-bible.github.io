The battle for AI leadership is on, with OpenAI in the United States and
DeepSeek in China as key contenders. In response to these global trends, the
Spanish government has proposed ALIA, a public and transparent AI
infrastructure incorporating small language models designed to support Spanish
and co-official languages such as Basque. This paper presents the results of
Red Teaming sessions, where ten participants applied their expertise and
creativity to manually test three of the latest models from these
initiatives\\(\unicode\{x2013\}\\)OpenAI o3-mini, DeepSeek R1, and ALIA
Salamandra\\(\unicode\{x2013\}\\)focusing on biases and safety concerns. The results,
based on 670 conversations, revealed vulnerabilities in all the models under
test, with biased or unsafe responses ranging from 29.5% in o3-mini to 50.6% in
Salamandra. These findings underscore the persistent challenges in developing
reliable and trustworthy AI systems, particularly those intended to support
Spanish and Basque languages.

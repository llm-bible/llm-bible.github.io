Computing educators and researchers have used programming process data to
understand how programs are constructed and what sorts of problems students
struggle with. Although such data shows promise for using it for feedback,
fully automated programming process feedback systems have still been an
under-explored area. The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) have
yielded additional opportunities for researchers in a wide variety of fields.
LLMs are efficient at transforming content from one format to another,
leveraging the body of knowledge they have been trained with in the process. In
this article, we discuss opportunities of using LLMs for analyzing programming
process data. To complement our discussion, we outline a case study where we
have leveraged LLMs for automatically summarizing the programming process and
for creating formative feedback on the programming process. Overall, our
discussion and findings highlight that the computing education research and
practice community is again one step closer to automating formative programming
process-focused feedback.

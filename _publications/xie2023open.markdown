Language agents show potential in being capable of utilizing natural language
for varied and intricate tasks in diverse environments, particularly when built
upon large language models (LLMs). Current language agent frameworks aim to
facilitate the construction of proof-of-concept language agents while
neglecting the non-expert user access to agents and paying little attention to
application-level designs. We present OpenAgents, an open platform for using
and hosting language agents in the wild of everyday life. OpenAgents includes
three agents: (1) Data Agent for data analysis with Python/SQL and data tools;
(2) Plugins Agent with 200+ daily API tools; (3) Web Agent for autonomous web
browsing. OpenAgents enables general users to interact with agent
functionalities through a web user interface optimized for swift responses and
common failures while offering developers and researchers a seamless deployment
experience on local setups, providing a foundation for crafting innovative
language agents and facilitating real-world evaluations. We elucidate the
challenges and opportunities, aspiring to set a foundation for future research
and development of real-world language agents.

Synthetic text generation is challenging and has limited success. Recently a new architecture called Transformers allow machine learning models to understand better sequential data such as translation or summarization. BERT and GPT45;2 using Transformers in their cores have shown a great performance in tasks such as text classification translation and NLI tasks. In this article we analyse both algorithms and compare their output quality in text generation tasks.

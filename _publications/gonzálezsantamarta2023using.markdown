The deployment of autonomous robots in various domains has raised significant concerns about their trustworthiness and accountability. This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analyzing ROS 2 logs generated by autonomous robots and proposes a framework for log analysis that categorizes log files into different aspects. The study evaluates the performance of three different language models in answering questions related to StartUp Warning and PDDL logs. The results suggest that GPT 4 a transformer-based model outperforms other models however their verbosity is not enough to answer why or how questions for all kinds of actors involved in the interaction.

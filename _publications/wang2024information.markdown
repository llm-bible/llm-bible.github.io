Diffusion models for Text45;to45;Image (T2I) conditional generation have seen tremendous success recently. Despite their success accurately capturing user intentions with these models still requires a laborious trial and error process. This challenge is commonly identified as a model alignment problem an issue that has attracted considerable attention by the research community. Instead of relying on fine45;grained linguistic analyses of prompts human annotation or auxiliary vision45;language models to steer image generation in this work we present a novel method that relies on an information45;theoretic alignment measure. In a nutshell our method uses self45;supervised fine45;tuning and relies on point45;wise mutual information between prompts and images to define a synthetic training set to induce model alignment. Our comparative analysis shows that our method is on45;par or superior to the state45;of45;the45;art yet requires nothing but a pre45;trained denoising network to estimate MI and a lightweight fine45;tuning strategy.

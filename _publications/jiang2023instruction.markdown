Multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable powerful applications from their fused understanding of images and language but many perform poorly on UI tasks due to the lack of UI training data. In this paper we adapt a recipe for generating paired text-image training data for VLMs to the UI domain by combining existing pixel-based methods with a Large Language Model (LLM). Unlike prior art our method requires no human-provided annotations and it can be applied to any dataset of UI screenshots. We generate a dataset of 335K conversational examples paired with UIs that cover Qamp;A UI descriptions and planning and use it to fine-tune a conversational VLM for UI tasks. To assess the performance of our model we benchmark it on UI element detection tasks evaluate response quality and showcase its applicability to multi-step UI navigation and planning.

Understanding natural language requires common sense one aspect of which is the ability to discern the plausibility of events. While distributional models 45;45; most recently pre45;trained Transformer language models 45;45; have demonstrated improvements in modeling event plausibility their performance still falls short of humans. In this work we show that Transformer45;based plausibility models are markedly inconsistent across the conceptual classes of a lexical hierarchy inferring that a person breathing is plausible while a dentist breathing is not for example. We find this inconsistency persists even when models are softly injected with lexical knowledge and we present a simple post45;hoc method of forcing model consistency that improves correlation with human plausibility judgements.

We introduce OpenFlamingo, a family of autoregressive vision-language models
ranging from 3B to 9B parameters. OpenFlamingo is an ongoing effort to produce
an open-source replication of DeepMind's Flamingo models. On seven
vision-language datasets, OpenFlamingo models average between 80 - 89% of
corresponding Flamingo performance. This technical report describes our models,
training data, hyperparameters, and evaluation suite. We share our models and
code at https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_flamingo.

AI agents, empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and communication protocols such as MCP and A2A, have rapidly evolved from simple chatbots to autonomous entities capable of executing complex, multi-step tasks, demonstrating great potential. However, the LLMs' inherent uncertainty and heavy computational resource requirements pose four significant challenges to the development of safe and efficient agents: reliability, privacy, cost and performance. Existing approaches, like model alignment, workflow constraints and on-device model deployment, can partially alleviate some issues but often with limitations, failing to fundamentally resolve these challenges.
  This paper proposes a new paradigm called AgentRR (Agent Record & Replay), which introduces the classical record-and-replay mechanism into AI agent frameworks. The core idea is to: 1. Record an agent's interaction trace with its environment and internal decision process during task execution, 2. Summarize this trace into a structured "experience" encapsulating the workflow and constraints, and 3. Replay these experiences in subsequent similar tasks to guide the agent's behavior. We detail a multi-level experience abstraction method and a check function mechanism in AgentRR: the former balances experience specificity and generality, while the latter serves as a trust anchor to ensure completeness and safety during replay. In addition, we explore multiple application modes of AgentRR, including user-recorded task demonstration, large-small model collaboration and privacy-aware agent execution, and envision an experience repository for sharing and reusing knowledge to further reduce deployment cost.

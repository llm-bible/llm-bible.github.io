Recent advances with language models (e.g. BERT XLNet ...) have allowed surpassing human performance on complex NLP tasks such as Reading Comprehension. However labeled datasets for training are available mostly in English which makes it difficult to acknowledge progress in other languages. Fortunately models are now pre45;trained on unlabeled data from hundreds of languages and exhibit interesting transfer abilities from one language to another. In this paper we show that multilingual BERT is naturally capable of zero45;shot transfer for an extractive Question Answering task (eQA) from English to other languages. More specifically it outperforms the best previously known baseline for transfer to Japanese and French. Moreover using a recently published large eQA French dataset we are able to further show that (1) zero45;shot transfer provides results really close to a direct training on the target language and (2) combination of transfer and training on target is the best option overall. We finally present a practical application a multilingual conversational agent called Kate which answers to HR45;related questions in several languages directly from the content of intranet pages.

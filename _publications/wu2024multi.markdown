In the realm of data45;driven AI technology the application of open45;source large language models (LLMs) in robotic task planning represents a significant milestone. Recent robotic task planning methods based on open45;source LLMs typically leverage vast task planning datasets to enhance models planning abilities. While these methods show promise they struggle with complex long45;horizon tasks which require comprehending more context and generating longer action sequences. This paper addresses this limitation by proposing MLDT theMulti45;Level Decomposition Task planning method. This method innovatively decomposes tasks at the goal45;level task45;level and action45;level to mitigate the challenge of complex long45;horizon tasks. In order to enhance open45;source LLMs planning abilities we introduce a goal45;sensitive corpus generation method to create high45;quality training data and conduct instruction tuning on the generated corpus. Since the complexity of the existing datasets is not high enough we construct a more challenging dataset LongTasks to specifically evaluate planning ability on complex long45;horizon tasks. We evaluate our method using various LLMs on four datasets in VirtualHome. Our results demonstrate a significant performance enhancement in robotic task planning showcasing MLDTs effectiveness in overcoming the limitations of existing methods based on open45;source LLMs as well as its practicality in complex real45;world scenarios.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential in handling complex reasoning tasks, which are usually achieved by
constructing a thought chain to guide the model to solve the problem with
multi-step thinking. However, existing methods often remain confined to
previously explored solution spaces and thus overlook the critical blind spot
within LLMs' cognitive range. To address these issues, we design the Thought
Space Explorer (TSE), a novel framework to expand and optimize thought
structures to guide LLMs to explore their blind spots of thinking. By
generating new reasoning steps and branches based on the original thought
structure with various designed strategies, TSE broadens the thought space and
alleviates the impact of blind spots for LLM reasoning. Experimental results on
multiple levels of reasoning tasks demonstrate the efficacy of TSE. We also
conduct extensive analysis to understand how structured and expansive thought
can contribute to unleashing the potential of LLM reasoning capabilities.

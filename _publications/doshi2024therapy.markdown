We present TheraGen, an advanced AI-powered mental health chatbot utilizing
the LLaMA 2 7B model. This approach builds upon recent advancements in language
models and transformer architectures. TheraGen provides all-day personalized,
compassionate mental health care by leveraging a large dataset of 1 million
conversational entries, combining anonymized therapy transcripts, online mental
health discussions, and psychological literature, including APA resources. Our
implementation employs transfer learning, fine-tuning, and advanced training
techniques to optimize performance. TheraGen offers a user-friendly interface
for seamless interaction, providing empathetic responses and evidence-based
coping strategies. Evaluation results demonstrate high user satisfaction rates,
with 94% of users reporting improved mental well-being. The system achieved a
BLEU score of 0.67 and a ROUGE score of 0.62, indicating strong response
accuracy. With an average response time of 1395 milliseconds, TheraGen ensures
real-time, efficient support. While not a replacement for professional therapy,
TheraGen serves as a valuable complementary tool, significantly improving user
well-being and addressing the accessibility gap in mental health treatments.
This paper details TheraGen's architecture, training methodology, ethical
considerations, and future directions, contributing to the growing field of
AI-assisted mental healthcare and offering a scalable solution to the pressing
need for mental health support.

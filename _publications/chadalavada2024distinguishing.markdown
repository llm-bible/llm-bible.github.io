Users increasingly query LLM-enabled web chatbots for help with scam defense.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's complaints database is a rich data
source for evaluating LLM performance on user scam queries, but currently the
corpus does not distinguish between scam and non-scam fraud. We developed an
LLM ensemble approach to distinguishing scam and fraud CFPB complaints and
describe initial findings regarding the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in the
scam defense context.

Role45;playing agents (RPA) have been a popular application area for large language models (LLMs) attracting significant interest from both industry and academia.While existing RPAs well portray the characters knowledge and tones they face challenges in capturing their minds especially for small role45;playing language models (RPLMs). In this paper we propose to enhance RPLMs via personality45;indicative data. Specifically we leverage questions from psychological scales and distill advanced RPAs to generate dialogues that grasp the minds of characters. Experimental results validate that RPLMs trained with our dataset exhibit advanced role45;playing capabilities for both general and personality45;related evaluations. Code and data are available at href123;https://github.com/alienet1109/RolePersonality&#125;&#123;this URL125;.

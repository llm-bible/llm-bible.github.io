We propose a novel conditioned text generation model. It draws inspiration from traditional template-based text generation techniques where the source provides the content (i.e. what to say) and the template influences how to say it. Building on the successful encoder-decoder paradigm it first encodes the content representation from the given input text; to produce the output it retrieves exemplar text from the training data as soft templates which are then used to construct an exemplar-specific decoder. We evaluate the proposed model on abstractive text summarization and data-to-text generation. Empirical results show that this model achieves strong performance and outperforms comparable baselines.

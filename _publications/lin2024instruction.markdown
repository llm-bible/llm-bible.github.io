Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both
2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object
joint distributions and express object relations, hindering generation's
controllability. We introduce InstructLayout, a novel generative framework that
integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve
controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed
semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions
simultaneously, demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a
zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 2D and 3D
scene synthesis, we respectively curate two high-quality datasets of
layout-instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and
multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in
both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the
efficacy of crucial design components.

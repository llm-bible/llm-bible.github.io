Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both 2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object joint distributions and express object relations hindering generations controllability. We introduce InstructLayout a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions simultaneously demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero45;shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text45;driven 2D and 3D scene synthesis we respectively curate two high45;quality datasets of layout45;instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing state45;of45;the45;art approaches by a large margin in both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components.

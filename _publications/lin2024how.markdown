One-on-one tutoring is widely acknowledged as an effective instructional method conditioned on qualified tutors. However the high demand for qualified tutors remains a challenge often necessitating the training of novice tutors (i.e. trainees) to ensure effective tutoring. Research suggests that providing timely explanatory feedback can facilitate the training process for trainees. However it presents challenges due to the time-consuming nature of assessing trainee performance by human experts. Inspired by the recent advancements of large language models (LLMs) our study employed the GPT-4 model to build an explanatory feedback system. This system identifies trainees responses in binary form (i.e. correct/incorrect) and automatically provides template-based feedback with responses appropriately rephrased by the GPT-4 model. We conducted our study on 410 responses from trainees across three training lessons Giving Effective Praise Reacting to Errors and Determining What Students Know. Our findings indicate that 1) using a few-shot approach the GPT-4 model effectively identifies correct/incorrect trainees responses from three training lessons with an average F1 score of 0.84 and an AUC score of 0.85; and 2) using the few-shot approach the GPT-4 model adeptly rephrases incorrect trainees responses into desired responses achieving performance comparable to that of human experts.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in various applications including security. This paper explores the utility of LLMs in scam detection a critical aspect of cybersecurity. Unlike traditional applications we propose a novel use case for LLMs to identify scams such as phishing advance fee fraud and romance scams. We present notable security applications of LLMs and discuss the unique challenges posed by scams. Specifically we outline the key steps involved in building an effective scam detector using LLMs emphasizing data collection preprocessing model selection training and integration into target systems. Additionally we conduct a preliminary evaluation using GPT45;3.5 and GPT45;4 on a duplicated email highlighting their proficiency in identifying common signs of phishing or scam emails. The results demonstrate the models effectiveness in recognizing suspicious elements but we emphasize the need for a comprehensive assessment across various language tasks. The paper concludes by underlining the importance of ongoing refinement and collaboration with cybersecurity experts to adapt to evolving threats.

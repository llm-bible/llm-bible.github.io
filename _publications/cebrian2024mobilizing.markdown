Advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's
GPT-4o, offer significant potential for mediating human interactions across
various contexts. However, their use in areas such as persuasion, influence,
and recruitment raises ethical and security concerns. To evaluate these models
ethically in public influence and persuasion scenarios, we developed a
prompting strategy using "Where's Waldo?" images as proxies for complex,
crowded gatherings. This approach provides a controlled, replicable environment
to assess the model's ability to process intricate visual information,
interpret social dynamics, and propose engagement strategies while avoiding
privacy concerns. By positioning Waldo as a hypothetical agent tasked with
face-to-face mobilization, we analyzed the model's performance in identifying
key individuals and formulating mobilization tactics. Our results show that
while the model generates vivid descriptions and creative strategies, it cannot
accurately identify individuals or reliably assess social dynamics in these
scenarios. Nevertheless, this methodology provides a valuable framework for
testing and benchmarking the evolving capabilities of multimodal LLMs in social
contexts.

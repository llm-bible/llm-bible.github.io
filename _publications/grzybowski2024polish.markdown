Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
handling specialized tasks, including medical problem-solving. However, most
studies predominantly focus on English-language contexts. This study introduces
a novel benchmark dataset based on Polish medical licensing and specialization
exams (LEK, LDEK, PES) taken by medical doctor candidates and practicing
doctors pursuing specialization. The dataset was web-scraped from publicly
available resources provided by the Medical Examination Center and the Chief
Medical Chamber. It comprises over 24,000 exam questions, including a subset of
parallel Polish-English corpora, where the English portion was professionally
translated by the examination center for foreign candidates. By creating a
structured benchmark from these existing exam questions, we systematically
evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including general-purpose, domain-specific, and
Polish-specific models, and compare their performance against human medical
students. Our analysis reveals that while models like GPT-4o achieve near-human
performance, significant challenges persist in cross-lingual translation and
domain-specific understanding. These findings underscore disparities in model
performance across languages and medical specialties, highlighting the
limitations and ethical considerations of deploying LLMs in clinical practice.

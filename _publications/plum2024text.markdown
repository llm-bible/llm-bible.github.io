This paper addresses the challenges in developing language models for
less-represented languages, with a focus on Luxembourgish. Despite its active
development, Luxembourgish faces a digital data scarcity, exacerbated by
Luxembourg's multilingual context. We propose a novel text generation model
based on the T5 architecture, combining limited Luxembourgish data with equal
amounts, in terms of size and type, of German and French data. We hypothesise
that a model trained on Luxembourgish, German, and French will improve the
model's cross-lingual transfer learning capabilities and outperform monolingual
and large multilingual models. To verify this, the study at hand explores
whether multilingual or monolingual training is more beneficial for
Luxembourgish language generation. For the evaluation, we introduce LuxGen, a
text generation benchmark that is the first of its kind for Luxembourgish.

Recently ChatGPT has drawn great attention from both the research community and the public. We are particularly interested in whether it can serve as a universal sentiment analyzer. To this end in this work we provide a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on the understanding of (emphopinions) (emphsentiments) and (emphemotions) contained in the text. Specifically we evaluate it in three settings including (emphstandard) evaluation (emph)polarity shift evaluation and (emph)open-domain evaluation. We conduct an evaluation on 7 representative sentiment analysis tasks covering 17 benchmark datasets and compare ChatGPT with fine-tuned BERT and corresponding state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on them. We also attempt several popular prompting techniques to elicit the ability further. Moreover we conduct human evaluation and present some qualitative case studies to gain a deep comprehension of its sentiment analysis capabilities.

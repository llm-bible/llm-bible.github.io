Recently ChatGPT has drawn great attention from both the research community and the public. We are particularly interested in whether it can serve as a universal sentiment analyzer. To this end in this work we provide a preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on the understanding of emph123;opinions125; emph123;sentiments125; and emph123;emotions125; contained in the text. Specifically we evaluate it in three settings including emph123;standard125; evaluation emph123;polarity shift125; evaluation and emph123;open45;domain125; evaluation. We conduct an evaluation on 7 representative sentiment analysis tasks covering 17 benchmark datasets and compare ChatGPT with fine45;tuned BERT and corresponding state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) models on them. We also attempt several popular prompting techniques to elicit the ability further. Moreover we conduct human evaluation and present some qualitative case studies to gain a deep comprehension of its sentiment analysis capabilities.

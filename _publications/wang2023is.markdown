Large Language Models (LLMs) representing a significant achievement in artificial intelligence (AI) research have demonstrated their ability in a multitude of tasks. This project aims to explore the capabilities of GPT-3.5 a leading example of LLMs in processing the sentiment analysis of Internet memes. Memes which include both verbal and visual aspects act as a powerful yet complex tool for expressing ideas and sentiments demanding an understanding of societal norms and cultural contexts. Notably the detection and moderation of hateful memes pose a significant challenge due to their implicit offensive nature. This project investigates GPTs proficiency in such subjective tasks revealing its strengths and potential limitations. The tasks include the classification of meme sentiment determination of humor type and detection of implicit hate in memes. The performance evaluation using datasets from SemEval-2020 Task 8 and Facebook hateful memes offers a comparative understanding of GPT responses against human annotations. Despite GPTs remarkable progress our findings underscore the challenges faced by these models in handling subjective tasks which are rooted in their inherent limitations including contextual understanding interpretation of implicit meanings and data biases. This research contributes to the broader discourse on the applicability of AI in handling complex context-dependent tasks and offers valuable insights for future advancements.

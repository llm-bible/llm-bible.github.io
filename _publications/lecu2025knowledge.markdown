Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural
language generation. However, they frequently generate unverified outputs,
which compromises their reliability in critical applications. In this study, we
propose an innovative framework that combines structured biomedical knowledge
with LLMs through a retrieval-augmented generation technique. Our system
develops a thorough knowledge graph by identifying and refining causal
relationships and named entities from medical abstracts related to age-related
macular degeneration (AMD). Using a vector-based retrieval process and a
locally deployed language model, our framework produces responses that are both
contextually relevant and verifiable, with direct references to clinical
evidence. Experimental results show that this method notably decreases
hallucinations, enhances factual precision, and improves the clarity of
generated responses, providing a robust solution for advanced biomedical
chatbot applications.

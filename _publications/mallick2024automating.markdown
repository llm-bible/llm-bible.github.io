We develop an iterative assistant we call ChatVis that can synthetically
generate Python scripts for data analysis and visualization using a large
language model (LLM). The assistant allows a user to specify the operations in
natural language, attempting to generate a Python script for the desired
operations, prompting the LLM to revise the script as needed until it executes
correctly. The iterations include an error detection and correction mechanism
that extracts error messages from the execution of the script and subsequently
prompts LLM to correct the error. Our method demonstrates correct execution on
five canonical visualization scenarios, comparing results with ground truth. We
also compared our results with scripts generated by several other LLMs without
any assistance. In every instance, ChatVis successfully generated the correct
script, whereas the unassisted LLMs failed to do so. The code is available on
GitHub: https://github.com/tanwimallick/ChatVis/.

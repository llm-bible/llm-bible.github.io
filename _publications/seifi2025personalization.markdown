Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have significant potential to provide
personalized assistance by adapting to the unique needs and preferences of
individual users. The personalization of LVLMs has emerged as a field that
focuses on customizing models to recognize specific object instances and
provide tailored responses. However, current methodologies depend on
time-consuming test-time training for each user and object, which proves to be
impractical. This paper introduces a novel, training-free approach to LVLM
personalization by leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models to extract
distinct features, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to recognize
instances in the visual input, and visual prompting methods. Our model-agnostic
vision toolkit enables flexible and efficient personalization without the need
for extensive retraining. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, surpassing
conventional training-based approaches, and set a new benchmark for LVLM
personalization.

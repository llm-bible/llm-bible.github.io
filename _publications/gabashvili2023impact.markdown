The conversational artificial-intelligence (AI) technology ChatGPT has become
one of the most widely used natural language processing tools. With thousands
of published papers demonstrating its applications across various industries
and fields, ChatGPT has sparked significant interest in the research community.
Reviews of primary data have also begun to emerge. An overview of the available
evidence from multiple reviews and studies could provide further insights,
minimize redundancy, and identify areas where further research is needed.
Objective: To evaluate the existing reviews and literature related to ChatGPT's
applications and its potential impact on different fields by conducting a
systematic review of reviews and bibliometric analysis of primary literature.
Methods: PubMed, EuropePMC, Dimensions AI, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and Google
Scholar were searched for ChatGPT-related publications from 2022 to 4/30/2023.
Studies including secondary data related to the application of ChatGPT were
considered. Reporting and risk of bias assesment was performed using PRISMA
guidelines. Results: A total of 305 unique records with potential relevance to
the review were identified from a pool of over 2,000 original articles. After
multi-step screening process, 11 reviews were selected, consisting of 9 reviews
specifically focused on ChatGPT and 2 reviews on broader AI topics that also
included discussions on ChatGPT. We also conducted bibliometric analysis of
primary data. Conclusions: While AI has the potential to revolutionize various
industries, further interdisciplinary research, customized integrations, and
ethical innovation are necessary to address existing concerns and ensure its
responsible use. Protocol Registration: PROSPERO registration no.

Generating free-text rationales is among the emergent capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). These rationales have been found to enhance LLM
performance across various NLP tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest
in using these rationales to provide insights for various important downstream
tasks. In this paper, we analyze generated free-text rationales in tasks with
subjective answers, emphasizing the importance of rationalization in such
scenarios. We focus on pairwise argument ranking, a highly subjective task with
significant potential for real-world applications, such as debate assistance.
We evaluate the persuasiveness of rationales generated by nine LLMs to support
their subjective choices. Our findings suggest that open-source LLMs,
particularly Llama2-70B-chat, are capable of providing highly persuasive
rationalizations, surpassing even GPT models. Additionally, our experiments
show that rationale persuasiveness can be improved by controlling its
parameters through prompting or through self-refinement.

Goal-conditioned and Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning (GCRL and MTRL) address numerous problems related to robot learning including locomotion navigation and manipulation scenarios. Recent works focusing on language-defined robotic manipulation tasks have led to the tedious production of massive human annotations to create dataset of textual descriptions associated with trajectories. To leverage reinforcement learning with text-based task descriptions we need to produce reward functions associated with individual tasks in a scalable manner. In this paper we leverage recent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and introduce (larg) Language-based Automatic Reward and Goal Generation an approach that converts a text-based task description into its corresponding reward and goal-generation functions We evaluate our approach for robotic manipulation and demonstrate its ability to train and execute policies in a scalable manner without the need for handcrafted reward functions.

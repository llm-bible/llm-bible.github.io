Despite considerable advancements with deep neural language models (LMs),
neural text generation still suffers from degeneration: the generated text is
repetitive, generic, self-contradictory, and often lacks commonsense. Our
analyses on sentence-level attention patterns in LMs reveal that neural
degeneration may be associated with insufficient learning of task-specific
characteristics by the attention mechanism. This finding motivates on-the-fly
attention modulation -- a simple but effective method that enables the
injection of priors into attention computation during inference. Automatic and
human evaluation results on three text generation benchmarks demonstrate that
attention modulation helps LMs generate text with enhanced fluency, creativity,
and commonsense reasoning, in addition to significantly reduce sentence-level
repetition.

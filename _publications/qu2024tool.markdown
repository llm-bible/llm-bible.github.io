Recently, tool learning with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for augmenting the capabilities of LLMs to tackle highly
complex problems. Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this
field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic
organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to
conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In
this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary
aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is
implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs.
We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration
and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific
aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according
to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning,
tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide
a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing
them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss
current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire
both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and
promising area. We also maintain a GitHub repository to continually keep track
of the relevant papers and resources in this rising area at

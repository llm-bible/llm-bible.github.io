While LLMs have exhibited strong performance on various NLP tasks, it is
noteworthy that most of these tasks rely on utilizing the vast amount of
knowledge encoded in LLMs' parameters, rather than solving new problems without
prior knowledge. In cognitive research, the latter ability is referred to as
fluid intelligence, which is considered to be critical for assessing human
intelligence. Recent research on fluid intelligence assessments has highlighted
significant deficiencies in LLMs' abilities. In this paper, we analyze the
challenges LLMs face in demonstrating fluid intelligence through controlled
experiments, using the most representative ARC task as an example. Our study
revealed three major limitations in existing LLMs: limited ability for skill
composition, unfamiliarity with abstract input formats, and the intrinsic
deficiency of left-to-right decoding. Our data and code can be found in

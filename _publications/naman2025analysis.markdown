Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly competent across
various domains, educators are showing a growing interest in integrating these
LLMs into the learning process. Especially in software engineering, LLMs have
demonstrated qualitatively better capabilities in code summarization, code
generation, and debugging. Despite various research on LLMs for software
engineering tasks in practice, limited research captures the benefits of LLMs
for pedagogical advancements and their impact on the student learning process.
To this extent, we analyze 126 undergraduate students' interaction with an AI
assistant during a 13-week semester to understand the benefits of AI for
software engineering learning. We analyze the conversations, code generated,
code utilized, and the human intervention levels to integrate the code into the
code base.
  Our findings suggest that students prefer ChatGPT over CoPilot. Our analysis
also finds that ChatGPT generates responses with lower computational complexity
compared to CoPilot. Furthermore, conversational-based interaction helps
improve the quality of the code generated compared to auto-generated code.
Early adoption of LLMs in software engineering is crucial to remain competitive
in the rapidly developing landscape. Hence, the next generation of software
engineers must acquire the necessary skills to interact with AI to improve
productivity.

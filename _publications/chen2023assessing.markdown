This study critically evaluates the efficacy of prompting methods in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capability of large language models
(LLMs). The investigation uses three prescriptive prompting methods - simple,
persona, and conversational prompting - known for their effectiveness in
enhancing the linguistic tasks of LLMs. We conduct this analysis on OpenAI's
LLM chatbot, ChatGPT-3.5, on extensive problem sets from the MATH, GSM8K, and
MMLU datasets, encompassing a broad spectrum of mathematical challenges. A
grading script adapted to each dataset is used to determine the effectiveness
of these prompting interventions in enhancing the model's mathematical analysis
power. Contrary to expectations, our empirical analysis reveals that none of
the investigated methods consistently improves over ChatGPT-3.5's baseline
performance, with some causing significant degradation. Our findings suggest
that prompting strategies do not necessarily generalize to new domains, in this
study failing to enhance mathematical performance.

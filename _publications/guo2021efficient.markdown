Recent work has shown that either (1) increasing the input length or (2) increasing model size can improve the performance of Transformer45;based neural models. In this paper we present a new model called LongT5 with which we explore the effects of scaling both the input length and model size at the same time. Specifically we integrated attention ideas from long45;input transformers (ETC) and adopted pre45;training strategies from summarization pre45;training (PEGASUS) into the scalable T5 architecture. The result is a new attention mechanism we call 123;em Transient Global125; (TGlobal) which mimics ETCs local/global attention mechanism but without requiring additional side45;inputs. We are able to achieve state45;of45;the45;art results on several summarization tasks and outperform the original T5 models on question answering tasks.

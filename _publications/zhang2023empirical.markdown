Recently, various illustrative examples have shown the impressive ability of
generative large language models (LLMs) to perform NLP related tasks. ChatGPT
undoubtedly is the most representative model. We empirically evaluate ChatGPT's
performance on requirements information retrieval (IR) tasks to derive insights
into designing or developing more effective requirements retrieval methods or
tools based on generative LLMs. We design an evaluation framework considering
four different combinations of two popular IR tasks and two common artifact
types. Under zero-shot setting, evaluation results reveal ChatGPT's promising
ability to retrieve requirements relevant information (high recall) and limited
ability to retrieve more specific requirements information (low precision). Our
evaluation of ChatGPT on requirements IR under zero-shot setting provides
preliminary evidence for designing or developing more effective requirements IR
methods or tools based on LLMs.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in complex tasks like machine translation commonsense reasoning and language understanding. One of the primary reasons for the adaptability of LLMs in such diverse tasks is their in-context learning (ICL) capability which allows them to perform well on new tasks by simply using a few task samples in the prompt. Despite their effectiveness in enhancing the performance of LLMs on diverse language and tabular tasks these methods have not been thoroughly explored for their potential to generate post hoc explanations. In this work we carry out one of the first explorations to analyze the effectiveness of LLMs in explaining other complex predictive models using ICL. To this end we propose a novel framework In-Context Explainers comprising of three novel approaches that exploit the ICL capabilities of LLMs to explain the predictions made by other predictive models. We conduct extensive analysis with these approaches on real-world tabular and text datasets and demonstrate that LLMs are capable of explaining other predictive models similar to state-of-the-art post hoc explainers opening up promising avenues for future research into LLM-based post hoc explanations of complex predictive models.

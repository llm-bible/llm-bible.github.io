Riddle-solving requires advanced reasoning skills, pushing LLMs to engage in
abstract thinking and creative problem-solving, often revealing limitations in
their cognitive abilities. In this paper, we examine the riddle-solving
capabilities of LLMs using a multiple-choice format, exploring how different
prompting techniques impact performance on riddles that demand diverse
reasoning skills. To enhance results, we introduce RISCORE (RIddle Solving with
COntext REcontruciton) a novel fully automated prompting method that generates
and utilizes contextually reconstructed sentence-based puzzles in conjunction
with the original examples to create few-shot exemplars. Our experiments
demonstrate that RISCORE significantly improves the performance of language
models in both vertical and lateral thinking tasks, surpassing traditional
exemplar selection strategies across a variety of few-shot settings.

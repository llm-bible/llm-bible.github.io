Augmented Language Models (ALMs) empower large language models with the ability to use tools transforming them into intelligent agents for real-world interactions. However most existing frameworks for ALMs to varying degrees are deficient in the following critical features flexible customization collaborative democratization and holistic evaluation. We present gentopia an ALM framework enabling flexible customization of agents through simple configurations seamlessly integrating various language models task formats prompting modules and plugins into a unified paradigm. Furthermore we establish gentpool a public platform enabling the registration and sharing of user-customized agents. Agents registered in gentpool are composable such that they can be assembled together for agent collaboration advancing the democratization of artificial intelligence. To ensure high-quality agents gentbench an integral component of gentpool is designed to thoroughly evaluate user-customized agents across diverse aspects such as safety robustness efficiency etc. We release gentopia on Github and will continuously move forward.

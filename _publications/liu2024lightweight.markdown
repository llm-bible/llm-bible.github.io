The booming success of LLMs initiates rapid development in LLM agents. Though the foundation of an LLM agent is the generative model it is critical to devise the optimal reasoning strategies and agent architectures. Accordingly LLM agent research advances from the simple chain45;of45;thought prompting to more complex ReAct and Reflection reasoning strategy; agent architecture also evolves from single agent generation to multi45;agent conversation as well as multi45;LLM multi45;agent group chat. However with the existing intricate frameworks and libraries creating and evaluating new reasoning strategies and agent architectures has become a complex challenge which hinders research investigation into LLM agents. Thus we open45;source a new AI agent library AgentLite which simplifies this process by offering a lightweight user45;friendly platform for innovating LLM agent reasoning architectures and applications with ease. AgentLite is a task45;oriented framework designed to enhance the ability of agents to break down tasks and facilitate the development of multi45;agent systems. Furthermore we introduce multiple practical applications developed with AgentLite to demonstrate its convenience and flexibility.

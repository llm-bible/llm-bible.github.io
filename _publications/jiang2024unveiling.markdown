The strategic significance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in economic
expansion, innovation, societal development, and national security has been
increasingly recognized since the advent of ChatGPT. This study provides a
comprehensive comparative evaluation of American and Chinese LLMs in both
English and Chinese contexts. We proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework
that encompasses natural language proficiency, disciplinary expertise, and
safety and responsibility, and systematically assessed 16 prominent models from
the US and China under various operational tasks and scenarios. Our key
findings show that GPT 4-Turbo is at the forefront in English contexts, whereas
Ernie-Bot 4 stands out in Chinese contexts. The study also highlights
disparities in LLM performance across languages and tasks, stressing the
necessity for linguistically and culturally nuanced model development. The
complementary strengths of American and Chinese LLMs point to the value of
Sino-US collaboration in advancing LLM technology. The research presents the
current LLM competition landscape and offers valuable insights for policymakers
and businesses regarding strategic LLM investments and development. Future work
will expand on this framework to include emerging LLM multimodal capabilities
and business application assessments.

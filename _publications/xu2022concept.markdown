Maintaining a consistent persona is essential for building a human45;like conversational model. However the lack of attention to the partner makes the model more egocentric they tend to show their persona by all means such as twisting the topic stiffly pulling the conversation to their own interests regardless and rambling their persona with little curiosity to the partner. In this work we propose COSPLAY(COncept Set guided PersonaLized dialogue generation Across both partY personas) that considers both parties as a team expressing self45;persona while keeping curiosity toward the partner leading responses around mutual personas and finding the common ground. Specifically we first represent self45;persona partner persona and mutual dialogue all in the concept sets. Then we propose the Concept Set framework with a suite of knowledge45;enhanced operations to process them such as set algebras set expansion and set distance. Based on these operations as medium we train the model by utilizing 1) concepts of both party personas 2) concept relationship between them and 3) their relationship to the future dialogue. Extensive experiments on a large public dataset Persona45;Chat demonstrate that our model outperforms state45;of45;the45;art baselines for generating less egocentric more human45;like and higher quality responses in both automatic and human evaluations.

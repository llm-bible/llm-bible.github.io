Large Foundational Language Models are capable of performing many tasks at a high level but are difficult to deploy in many applications because of their size and proprietary ownership. Many will be motivated to distill specific capabilities of foundational models into smaller models that can be owned and controlled. In the development of a therapeutic chatbot we wish to distill a capability known as reflective listening in which a therapist produces reflections of client speech. These reflections either restate what a client has said or connect what was said to a relevant observation idea or guess that encourages and guides the client to continue contemplation. In this paper we present a method for distilling the generation of reflections from a Foundational Language Model (GPT-4) into smaller models. We first show that GPT-4 using zero-shot prompting can generate reflections at near 10037; success rate superior to all previous methods. Using reflections generated by GPT-4 we fine-tune different sizes of the GPT-2 family. The GPT-2-small model achieves 8337; success on a hold-out test set and the GPT-2 XL achieves 9037; success. We also show that GPT-4 can help in the labor-intensive task of evaluating the quality of the distilled models using it as a zero-shot classifier. Using triple-human review as a guide the classifier achieves a Cohen-Kappa of 0.66 a substantial inter-rater reliability figure.

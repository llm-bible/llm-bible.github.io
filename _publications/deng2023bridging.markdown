Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown immense potential in multimodal applications yet the convergence of textual and musical domains remains not well45;explored. To address this gap we present MusiLingo a novel system for music caption generation and music45;related query responses. MusiLingo employs a single projection layer to align music representations from the pre45;trained frozen music audio model MERT with a frozen LLM bridging the gap between music audio and textual contexts. We train it on an extensive music caption dataset and fine45;tune it with instructional data. Due to the scarcity of high45;quality music Qamp;A datasets we created the MusicInstruct (MI) dataset from captions in the MusicCaps datasets tailored for open45;ended music inquiries. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its competitive performance in generating music captions and composing music45;related Qamp;A pairs. Our introduced dataset enables notable advancements beyond previous ones.

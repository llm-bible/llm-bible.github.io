Social intelligence is built upon three foundational pillars: cognitive
intelligence, situational intelligence, and behavioral intelligence. As large
language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our social lives,
understanding, evaluating, and developing their social intelligence are
becoming increasingly important. While multiple existing works have
investigated the social intelligence of LLMs, (1) most focus on a specific
aspect, and the social intelligence of LLMs has yet to be systematically
organized and studied; (2) position LLMs as passive observers from a
third-person perspective, such as in Theory of Mind (ToM) tests. Compared to
the third-person perspective, ego-centric first-person perspective evaluation
can align well with actual LLM-based Agent use scenarios. (3) a lack of
comprehensive evaluation of behavioral intelligence, with specific emphasis on
incorporating critical human-machine interaction scenarios. In light of this,
we present EgoSocialArena, a novel framework grounded in the three pillars of
social intelligence: cognitive, situational, and behavioral intelligence, aimed
to systematically evaluate the social intelligence of LLMs from a first-person
perspective. With EgoSocialArena, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
eight prominent foundation models, even the most advanced LLMs like O1-preview
lag behind human performance.

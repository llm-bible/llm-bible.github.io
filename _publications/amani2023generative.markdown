ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool that can engage in human-like conversations and generate coherent and contextually relevant responses to various prompts. ChatGPT is capable of understanding natural text that is input by a user and generating appropriate responses in various forms. This tool represents a major step in how humans are interacting with technology. This paper specifically focuses on how ChatGPT is revolutionizing the realm of engineering education and the relationship between technology students and faculty and staff. Because this tool is quickly changing and improving with the potential for even greater future capability it is a critical time to collect pertinent data. A survey was created to measure the effects of ChatGPT on students faculty and staff. This survey is shared as a Texas Aamp;M University technical report to allow other universities and entities to use this survey and measure the effects elsewhere.

This paper reviews the state45;of45;the45;art of language models architectures and strategies for complex question45;answering (QA CQA CPS) with a focus on hybridization. Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems (e.g. How does the concept of personal freedom vary between different cultures What is the best mix of power generation methods to reduce climate change ) you may need specific architecture knowledge skills methods sensitive data protection explainability human approval and versatile feedback... Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non45;specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of LLM in complex QA. In this paper we start by reviewing required skills and evaluation techniques. We integrate findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG BLOOM and HELM which open source benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness robustness toxicity ...) as a baseline. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA including domain adaptation decomposition and efficient multi45;step QA long form and non45;factoid QA safety and multi45;sensitivity data protection multimodal search hallucinations explainability and truthfulness temporal reasoning. We analyze current solutions and promising research trends using elements such as hybrid LLM architectural patterns training and prompting strategies active human reinforcement learning supervised with AI neuro45;symbolic and structured knowledge grounding program synthesis iterated decomposition and others.

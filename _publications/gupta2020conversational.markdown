Conversational Machine Comprehension (CMC) a research track in conversational AI expects the machine to understand an open45;domain natural language text and thereafter engage in a multi45;turn conversation to answer questions related to the text. While most of the research in Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC) revolves around single45;turn question answering (QA) multi45;turn CMC has recently gained prominence thanks to the advancement in natural language understanding via neural language models such as BERT and the introduction of large45;scale conversational datasets such as CoQA and QuAC. The rise in interest has however led to a flurry of concurrent publications each with a different yet structurally similar modeling approach and an inconsistent view of the surrounding literature. With the volume of model submissions to conversational datasets increasing every year there exists a need to consolidate the scattered knowledge in this domain to streamline future research. This literature review attempts at providing a holistic overview of CMC with an emphasis on the common trends across recently published models specifically in their approach to tackling conversational history. The review synthesizes a generic framework for CMC models while highlighting the differences in recent approaches and intends to serve as a compendium of CMC for future researchers.

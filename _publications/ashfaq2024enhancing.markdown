The complexity and dynamic nature of System of Systems (SoS) necessitate efficient communication mechanisms to ensure interoperability and collaborative functioning among constituent systems termed holons. This paper proposes an innovative approach to enhance holon communication within SoS through the integration of Conversational Generative Intelligence (CGI) techniques. Our approach leverages advancements in CGI specifically Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable holons to understand and act on natural language instructions. This fosters more intuitive human-holon interactions improving social intelligence and ultimately leading to better coordination among diverse systems. This position paper outlines a conceptual framework for CGI-enhanced holon interaction discusses the potential impact on SoS adaptability usability and efficiency and sets the stage for future exploration and prototype implementation.

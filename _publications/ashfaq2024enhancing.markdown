The complexity and dynamic nature of System of Systems (SoS) necessitate
efficient communication mechanisms to ensure interoperability and collaborative
functioning among constituent systems, termed holons. This paper proposes an
innovative approach to enhance holon communication within SoS through the
integration of Conversational Generative Intelligence (CGI) techniques. Our
approach leverages advancements in CGI, specifically Large Language Models
(LLMs), to enable holons to understand and act on natural language
instructions. This fosters more intuitive human-holon interactions, improving
social intelligence and ultimately leading to better coordination among diverse
systems. This position paper outlines a conceptual framework for CGI-enhanced
holon interaction, discusses the potential impact on SoS adaptability,
usability and efficiency, and sets the stage for future exploration and
prototype implementation.

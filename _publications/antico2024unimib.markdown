Natural language processing skills of Large Language Models (LLMs) are
unprecedented, having wide diffusion and application in different tasks. This
pilot study focuses on specializing ChatGPT behavior through a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the OpenAI custom GPTs
feature. The purpose of our chatbot, called Unimib Assistant, is to provide
information and solutions to the specific needs of University of Milano-Bicocca
(Unimib) students through a question-answering approach. We provided the system
with a prompt highlighting its specific purpose and behavior, as well as
university-related documents and links obtained from an initial need-finding
phase, interviewing six students. After a preliminary customization phase, a
qualitative usability test was conducted with six other students to identify
the strengths and weaknesses of the chatbot, with the goal of improving it in a
subsequent redesign phase. While the chatbot was appreciated for its
user-friendly experience, perceived general reliability, well-structured
responses, and conversational tone, several significant technical and
functional limitations emerged. In particular, the satisfaction and overall
experience of the users was impaired by the system's inability to always
provide fully accurate information. Moreover, it would often neglect to report
relevant information even if present in the materials uploaded and prompt
given. Furthermore, it sometimes generated unclickable links, undermining its
trustworthiness, since providing the source of information was an important
aspect for our users. Further in-depth studies and feedback from other users as
well as implementation iterations are planned to refine our Unimib Assistant.

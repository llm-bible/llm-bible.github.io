In modern commercial systems, including Recommendation, Ranking, and
E-Commerce platforms, there is a trend towards improving customer experiences
by incorporating Personalization context as input into Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, LLMs often struggle to effectively parse and utilize sparse
and complex personal context without additional processing or contextual
enrichment, underscoring the need for more sophisticated context understanding
mechanisms. In this work, we propose Guided Profile Generation (GPG), a general
method designed to generate personal profiles in natural language. As is
observed, intermediate guided profile generation enables LLMs to summarize, and
extract the important, distinctive features from the personal context into
concise, descriptive sentences, precisely tailoring their generation more
closely to an individual's unique habits and preferences. Our experimental
results show that GPG improves LLM's personalization ability across different
tasks, for example, it increases 37% accuracy in predicting personal preference
compared to directly feeding the LLMs with raw personal context.

Despite the increasing demand for AI-based mental health monitoring tools,
their practical utility for clinicians is limited by the lack of
interpretability.The CLPsych 2024 Shared Task (Chim et al., 2024) aims to
enhance the interpretability of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in
mental health analysis, by providing evidence of suicidality through linguistic
content. We propose a dual-prompting approach: (i) Knowledge-aware evidence
extraction by leveraging the expert identity and a suicide dictionary with a
mental health-specific LLM; and (ii) Evidence summarization by employing an
LLM-based consistency evaluator. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining domain-specific information, revealing performance
improvements and the approach's potential to aid clinicians in assessing mental
state progression.

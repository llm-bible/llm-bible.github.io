Recent advancements in prompting techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have improved their reasoning, planning, and action abilities. This paper
examines these prompting techniques through the lens of model predictive
control (MPC). We show that LLMs act as implicit planning cost function
minimizers when planning prompts are used. We propose a unified MPC framework
for planning with LLMs and demonstrate improved performance over few shot
prompting on several planning benchmarks.

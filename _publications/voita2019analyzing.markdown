Multi-head self-attention is a key component of the Transformer, a
state-of-the-art architecture for neural machine translation. In this work we
evaluate the contribution made by individual attention heads in the encoder to
the overall performance of the model and analyze the roles played by them. We
find that the most important and confident heads play consistent and often
linguistically-interpretable roles. When pruning heads using a method based on
stochastic gates and a differentiable relaxation of the L0 penalty, we observe
that specialized heads are last to be pruned. Our novel pruning method removes
the vast majority of heads without seriously affecting performance. For
example, on the English-Russian WMT dataset, pruning 38 out of 48 encoder heads
results in a drop of only 0.15 BLEU.

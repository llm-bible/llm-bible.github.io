Test stimuli generation has been a crucial but labor-intensive task in hardware design verification. In this paper we revolutionize this process by harnessing the power of large language models (LLMs) and present a novel benchmarking framework LLM4DV. This framework introduces a prompt template for interactively eliciting test stimuli from the LLM along with four innovative prompting improvements to support the pipeline execution and further enhance its performance. We compare LLM4DV to traditional constrained-random testing (CRT) using three self-designed design-under-test (DUT) modules. Experiments demonstrate that LLM4DV excels in efficiently handling straightforward DUT scenarios leveraging its ability to employ basic mathematical reasoning and pre-trained knowledge. While it exhibits reduced efficiency in complex task settings it still outperforms CRT in relative terms. The proposed framework and the DUT modules used in our experiments will be open-sourced upon publication.

Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward
intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a
systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' abilities as agents. We introduce
SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs
as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including
Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique
setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment
variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important
capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object
dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and
understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each
game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not
only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM
agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies. We
release our benchmark at github.com/Microsoft/SmartPlay

Rapid advancements have been made in extending Large Language Models (LLMs) to Large Multi45;modal Models (LMMs). However extending input modality of LLMs to video data remains a challenging endeavor especially for long videos. Due to insufficient access to large45;scale high45;quality video data and the excessive compression of visual features current methods exhibit limitations in effectively processing long videos. In this paper we introduce Kangaroo a powerful Video LMM aimed at addressing these challenges. Confronted with issue of inadequate training data we develop a data curation system to build a large45;scale dataset with high45;quality annotations for vision45;language pre45;training and instruction tuning. In addition we design a curriculum training pipeline with gradually increasing resolution and number of input frames to accommodate long videos. Evaluation results demonstrate that with 8B parameters Kangaroo achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance across a variety of video understanding benchmarks while exhibiting competitive results on others. Particularly on benchmarks specialized for long videos Kangaroo excels some larger models with over 10B parameters and proprietary models.

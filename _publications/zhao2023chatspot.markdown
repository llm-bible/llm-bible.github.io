Human-AI interactivity is a critical aspect that reflects the usability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However existing end-to-end MLLMs only allow users to interact with them through language instructions leading to the limitation of the interactive accuracy and efficiency. In this study we present precise referring instructions that utilize diverse reference representations such as points and boxes as referring prompts to refer to the special region. This enables MLLMs to focus on the region of interest and achieve finer-grained interaction. Based on precise referring instruction we propose ChatSpot a unified end-to-end multimodal large language model that supports diverse forms of interactivity including mouse clicks drag-and-drop and drawing boxes which provides a more flexible and seamless interactive experience. We also construct a multi-grained vision-language instruction-following dataset based on existing datasets and GPT-4 generating. Furthermore we design a series of evaluation tasks to assess the effectiveness of region recognition and interaction. Experimental results showcase ChatSpots promising performance.

This paper investigates the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) using 50 newly constructed high-school-level word
problems. Unlike prior studies that focus solely on answer correctness, we
rigorously analyze both final answers and solution steps to identify reasoning
failures. Evaluating eight state-of-the-art models - including Mixtral, Llama,
Gemini, GPT-4o, and OpenAI's o1 variants - we find that while newer models
(e.g., o3-mini, deepseek-r1) achieve higher accuracy, all models exhibit errors
in spatial reasoning, strategic planning, and arithmetic, sometimes producing
correct answers through flawed logic. Common failure modes include unwarranted
assumptions, over-reliance on numerical patterns, and difficulty translating
physical intuition into mathematical steps. Manual analysis reveals that models
struggle with problems requiring multi-step deduction or real-world knowledge,
despite possessing broad mathematical knowledge. Our results underscore the
importance of evaluating reasoning processes, not just answers, and caution
against overestimating LLMs' problem-solving proficiency. The study highlights
persistent gaps in LLMs' generalization abilities, emphasizing the need for
targeted improvements in structured reasoning and constraint handling.

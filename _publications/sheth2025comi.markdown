We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated Hindi-English code-mixed dataset, comprising 125K+ high-quality instances across five core NLP tasks: Matrix Language Identification, Token-level Language Identification, POS Tagging, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Machine Translation. Each instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa \\(\geq\\) 0.81). The rigorously preprocessed and filtered dataset covers both Devanagari and Roman scripts and spans diverse domains, ensuring real-world linguistic coverage. Evaluation reveals that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform traditional tools and open-source models. Notably, one-shot prompting consistently boosts performance across tasks, especially in structure-sensitive predictions like POS and NER, highlighting the effectiveness of prompt-based adaptation in code-mixed, low-resource settings. COMI-LINGUA is publicly available at: https://github.com/lingo-iitgn/CodeMixing_Project.

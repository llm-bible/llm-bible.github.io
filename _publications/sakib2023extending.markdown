Large-scale language models (LLMs) have emerged as a groundbreaking innovation in the realm of question-answering and conversational agents. These models leveraging different deep learning architectures such as Transformers are trained on vast corpora to predict sentences based on given queries. Among these LLMs ChatGPT developed by OpenAI has ushered in a new era by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to tackle diverse problem domains ranging from composing essays and biographies to solving intricate mathematical integrals. The versatile applications enabled by ChatGPT offer immense value to users. However assessing the performance of ChatGPTs output poses a challenge particularly in scenarios where queries lack clear objective criteria for correctness. For instance evaluating the quality of generated essays becomes arduous and relies heavily on manual labor in stark contrast to evaluating solutions to well-defined closed-ended questions such as mathematical problems. This research paper delves into the efficacy of ChatGPT in solving programming problems examining both the correctness and the efficiency of its solution in terms of time and memory complexity. The research reveals a commendable overall success rate of 71.875 denoting the proportion of problems for which ChatGPT was able to provide correct solutions that successfully satisfied all the test cases present in Leetcode. It exhibits strengths in structured problems and shows a linear correlation between its success rate and problem acceptance rates. However it struggles to improve solutions based on feedback pointing to potential shortcomings in debugging tasks. These findings provide a compact yet insightful glimpse into ChatGPTs capabilities and areas for improvement.

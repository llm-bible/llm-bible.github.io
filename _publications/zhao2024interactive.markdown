Large Language Models~(LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities across various
applications but face challenges such as hallucination, limited reasoning
abilities, and factual inconsistencies, especially when tackling complex,
domain-specific tasks like question answering~(QA). While Knowledge
Graphs~(KGs) have been shown to help mitigate these issues, research on the
integration of LLMs with background KGs remains limited. In particular, user
accessibility and the flexibility of the underlying KG have not been thoroughly
explored. We introduce AGENTiGraph (Adaptive Generative ENgine for Task-based
Interaction and Graphical Representation), a platform for knowledge management
through natural language interaction. It integrates knowledge extraction,
integration, and real-time visualization. AGENTiGraph employs a multi-agent
architecture to dynamically interpret user intents, manage tasks, and integrate
new knowledge, ensuring adaptability to evolving user requirements and data
contexts. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in knowledge graph
interactions, particularly for complex domain-specific tasks. Experimental
results on a dataset of 3,500 test cases show AGENTiGraph significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines, achieving 95.12% accuracy in
task classification and 90.45% success rate in task execution. User studies
corroborate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To showcase versatility,
we extended AGENTiGraph to legislation and healthcare domains, constructing
specialized KGs capable of answering complex queries in legal and medical
contexts.

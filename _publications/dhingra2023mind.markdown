Cognitive psychology delves on understanding perception attention memory language problem45;solving decision45;making and reasoning. Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as potent tools increasingly capable of performing human45;level tasks. The recent development in the form of GPT45;4 and its demonstrated success in tasks complex to humans exam and complex problems has led to an increased confidence in the LLMs to become perfect instruments of intelligence. Although GPT45;4 report has shown performance on some cognitive psychology tasks a comprehensive assessment of GPT45;4 via the existing well45;established datasets is required. In this study we focus on the evaluation of GPT45;4s performance on a set of cognitive psychology datasets such as CommonsenseQA SuperGLUE MATH and HANS. In doing so we understand how GPT45;4 processes and integrates cognitive psychology with contextual information providing insight into the underlying cognitive processes that enable its ability to generate the responses. We show that GPT45;4 exhibits a high level of accuracy in cognitive psychology tasks relative to the prior state45;of45;the45;art models. Our results strengthen the already available assessments and confidence on GPT45;4s cognitive psychology abilities. It has significant potential to revolutionize the field of AI by enabling machines to bridge the gap between human and machine reasoning.

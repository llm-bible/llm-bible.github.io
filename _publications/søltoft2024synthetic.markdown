This paper introduces "Synthetic Interlocutors" for ethnographic research.
Synthetic Interlocutors are chatbots ingested with ethnographic textual
material (interviews and observations) by using Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG). We integrated an open-source large language model with ethnographic data
from three projects to explore two questions: Can RAG digest ethnographic
material and act as ethnographic interlocutor? And, if so, can Synthetic
Interlocutors prolong encounters with the field and extend our analysis?
Through reflections on the process of building our Synthetic Interlocutors and
an experimental collaborative workshop, we suggest that RAG can digest
ethnographic materials, and it might lead to prolonged, yet uneasy ethnographic
encounters that allowed us to partially recreate and re-visit fieldwork
interactions while facilitating opportunities for novel analytic insights.
Synthetic Interlocutors can produce collaborative, ambiguous and serendipitous
moments.

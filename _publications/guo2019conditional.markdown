In recent years, with the development of deep learning, text generation
technology has undergone great changes and provided many kinds of services for
human beings, such as restaurant reservation and daily communication. The
automatically generated text is becoming more and more fluent so researchers
begin to consider more anthropomorphic text generation technology, that is the
conditional text generation, including emotional text generation, personalized
text generation, and so on. Conditional Text Generation (CTG) has thus become a
research hotspot. As a promising research field, we find that many efforts have
been paid to exploring it. Therefore, we aim to give a comprehensive review of
the new research trends of CTG. We first summary several key techniques and
illustrate the technical evolution route in the field of neural text
generation, based on the concept model of CTG. We further make an investigation
of existing CTG fields and propose several general learning models for CTG.
Finally, we discuss the open issues and promising research directions of CTG.

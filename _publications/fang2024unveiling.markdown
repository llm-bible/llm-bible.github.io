WebAssembly enables near-native execution in web applications and is
increasingly adopted for tasks that demand high performance and robust
security. However, its assembly-like syntax, implicit stack machine, and
low-level data types make it extremely difficult for human developers to
understand, spurring the need for effective WebAssembly reverse engineering
techniques. In this paper, we propose StackSight, a novel neurosymbolic
approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with advanced program
analysis to decompile complex WebAssembly code into readable C++ snippets.
StackSight visualizes and tracks virtual stack alterations via a static
analysis algorithm and then applies chain-of-thought prompting to harness LLM's
complex reasoning capabilities. Evaluation results show that StackSight
significantly improves WebAssembly decompilation. Our user study also
demonstrates that code snippets generated by StackSight have significantly
higher win rates and enable a better grasp of code semantics.

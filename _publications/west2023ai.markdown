ChatGPT is a groundbreaking ``chatbot"--an AI interface built on a large
language model that was trained on an enormous corpus of human text to emulate
human conversation. Beyond its ability to converse in a plausible way, it has
attracted attention for its ability to competently answer questions from the
bar exam and from MBA coursework, and to provide useful assistance in writing
computer code. These apparent abilities have prompted discussion of ChatGPT as
both a threat to the integrity of higher education and conversely as a powerful
teaching tool. In this work we present a preliminary analysis of how two
versions of ChatGPT (ChatGPT3.5 and ChatGPT4) fare in the field of
first-semester university physics, using a modified version of the Force
Concept Inventory (FCI) to assess whether it can give correct responses to
conceptual physics questions about kinematics and Newtonian dynamics. We
demonstrate that, by some measures, ChatGPT3.5 can match or exceed the median
performance of a university student who has completed one semester of college
physics, though its performance is notably uneven and the results are nuanced.
By these same measures, we find that ChatGPT4's performance is approaching the
point of being indistinguishable from that of an expert physicist when it comes
to introductory mechanics topics. After the completion of our work we became
aware of Ref [1], which preceded us to publication and which completes an
extensive analysis of the abilities of ChatGPT3.5 in a physics class, including
a different modified version of the FCI. We view this work as confirming that
portion of their results, and extending the analysis to ChatGPT4, which shows
rapid and notable improvement in most, but not all respects.

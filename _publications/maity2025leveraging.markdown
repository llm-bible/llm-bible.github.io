Question generation in education is a time-consuming and cognitively
demanding task, as it requires creating questions that are both contextually
relevant and pedagogically sound. Current automated question generation methods
often generate questions that are out of context. In this work, we explore
advanced techniques for automated question generation in educational contexts,
focusing on In-Context Learning (ICL), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a novel Hybrid Model that merges both methods. We implement GPT-4 for ICL
using few-shot examples and BART with a retrieval module for RAG. The Hybrid
Model combines RAG and ICL to address these issues and improve question
quality. Evaluation is conducted using automated metrics, followed by human
evaluation metrics. Our results show that both the ICL approach and the Hybrid
Model consistently outperform other methods, including baseline models, by
generating more contextually accurate and relevant questions.

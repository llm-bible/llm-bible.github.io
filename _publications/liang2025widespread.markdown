The recent advances in large language models (LLMs) attracted significant
public and policymaker interest in its adoption patterns. In this paper, we
systematically analyze LLM-assisted writing across four domains-consumer
complaints, corporate communications, job postings, and international
organization press releases-from January 2022 to September 2024. Our dataset
includes 687,241 consumer complaints, 537,413 corporate press releases, 304.3
million job postings, and 15,919 United Nations (UN) press releases. Using a
robust population-level statistical framework, we find that LLM usage surged
following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022. By late 2024, roughly 18% of
financial consumer complaint text appears to be LLM-assisted, with adoption
patterns spread broadly across regions and slightly higher in urban areas. For
corporate press releases, up to 24% of the text is attributable to LLMs. In job
postings, LLM-assisted writing accounts for just below 10% in small firms, and
is even more common among younger firms. UN press releases also reflect this
trend, with nearly 14% of content being generated or modified by LLMs. Although
adoption climbed rapidly post-ChatGPT, growth appears to have stabilized by
2024, reflecting either saturation in LLM adoption or increasing subtlety of
more advanced models. Our study shows the emergence of a new reality in which
firms, consumers and even international organizations substantially rely on
generative AI for communications.

Information on the web, such as scientific publications and Wikipedia, often
surpasses users' reading level. To help address this, we used a self-refinement
approach to develop a LLM capability for minimally lossy text simplification.
To validate our approach, we conducted a randomized study involving 4563
participants and 31 texts spanning 6 broad subject areas: PubMed (biomedical
scientific articles), biology, law, finance, literature/philosophy, and
aerospace/computer science. Participants were randomized to viewing original or
simplified texts in a subject area, and answered multiple-choice questions
(MCQs) that tested their comprehension of the text. The participants were also
asked to provide qualitative feedback such as task difficulty. Our results
indicate that participants who read the simplified text answered more MCQs
correctly than their counterparts who read the original text (3.9% absolute
increase, p<0.05). This gain was most striking with PubMed (14.6%), while more
moderate gains were observed for finance (5.5%), aerospace/computer science
(3.8%) domains, and legal (3.5%). Notably, the results were robust to whether
participants could refer back to the text while answering MCQs. The absolute
accuracy decreased by up to ~9% for both original and simplified setups where
participants could not refer back to the text, but the ~4% overall improvement
persisted. Finally, participants' self-reported perceived ease based on a
simplified NASA Task Load Index was greater for those who read the simplified
text (absolute change on a 5-point scale 0.33, p<0.05). This randomized study,
involving an order of magnitude more participants than prior works,
demonstrates the potential of LLMs to make complex information easier to
understand. Our work aims to enable a broader audience to better learn and make
use of expert knowledge available on the web, improving information
accessibility.

Conversational recommendation (ConvRec) systems must understand rich and diverse natural language (NL) expressions of user preferences and intents often communicated in an indirect manner (e.g. Im watching my weight). Such complex utterances make retrieving relevant items challenging especially if only using often incomplete or out-of-date metadata. Fortunately many domains feature rich item reviews that cover standard metadata categories and offer complex opinions that might match a users interests (e.g. classy joint for a date). However only recently have large language models (LLMs) let us unlock the commonsense connections between user preference utterances and complex language in user-generated reviews. Further LLMs enable novel paradigms for semi-structured dialogue state tracking complex intent and preference understanding and generating recommendations explanations and question answers. We thus introduce a novel technology RA-Rec a Retrieval-Augmented LLM-driven dialogue state tracking system for ConvRec showcased with a video open source GitHub repository and interactive Google Colab notebook.

Knowing that the generative capabilities of large language models (LLM) are
sometimes hampered by tendencies to hallucinate or create non-factual
responses, researchers have increasingly focused on methods to ground generated
outputs in factual data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a
key approach for integrating knowledge from data sources outside of the LLM's
training set, including proprietary and up-to-date information. While many
research papers explore various RAG strategies, their true efficacy is tested
in real-world applications with actual data. The journey from conceiving an
idea to actualizing it in the real world is a lengthy process. We present
insights from the development and field-testing of a pilot project that
integrates LLMs with RAG for information retrieval. Additionally, we examine
the impacts on the information value chain, encompassing people, processes, and
technology. Our aim is to identify the opportunities and challenges of
implementing this emerging technology, particularly within the context of
behavioral research in the information systems (IS) field. The contributions of
this work include the development of best practices and recommendations for
adopting this promising technology while ensuring compliance with industry
regulations through a proposed AI governance model.

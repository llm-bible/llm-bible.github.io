Text45;to45;Image (T2I) Synthesis has made tremendous strides in enhancing synthesized image quality but current datasets evaluate model performance only on descriptive instruction45;based prompts. Real45;world news image captions take a more pragmatic approach providing high45;level situational and Named45;Entity (NE) information and limited physical object descriptions making them abstractive. To evaluate the ability of T2I models to capture intended subjects from news captions we introduce the Abstractive News Captions with High45;level cOntext Representation (ANCHOR) dataset containing 70K+ samples sourced from 5 different news media organizations. With Large Language Models (LLM) achieving success in language and commonsense reasoning tasks we explore the ability of different LLMs to identify and understand key subjects from abstractive captions. Our proposed method Subject45;Aware Finetuning (SAFE) selects and enhances the representation of key subjects in synthesized images by leveraging LLM45;generated subject weights. It also adapts to the domain distribution of news images and captions through custom Domain Fine45;tuning outperforming current T2I baselines on ANCHOR. By launching the ANCHOR dataset we hope to motivate research in furthering the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) capabilities of T2I models.

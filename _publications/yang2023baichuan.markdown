Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on a
variety of natural language tasks based on just a few examples of natural
language instructions, reducing the need for extensive feature engineering.
However, most powerful LLMs are closed-source or limited in their capability
for languages other than English. In this technical report, we present Baichuan
2, a series of large-scale multilingual language models containing 7 billion
and 13 billion parameters, trained from scratch, on 2.6 trillion tokens.
Baichuan 2 matches or outperforms other open-source models of similar size on
public benchmarks like MMLU, CMMLU, GSM8K, and HumanEval. Furthermore, Baichuan
2 excels in vertical domains such as medicine and law. We will release all
pre-training model checkpoints to benefit the research community in better
understanding the training dynamics of Baichuan 2.

Recent advancements of generative LLMs (Large Language Models) have exhibited
human-like language capabilities but have shown a lack of domain-specific
understanding. Therefore, the research community has started the development of
domain-specific LLMs for many domains. In this work we focus on discussing how
to build mining domain-specific LLMs, as the global mining industry contributes
significantly to the worldwide economy. We report on MiningGPT, a mining
domain-specific instruction-following 7B parameter LLM model which showed a
14% higher mining domain knowledge test score as compared to its parent model
Mistral 7B instruct.

Cryptic crosswords are puzzles that rely not only on general knowledge but also on the solvers ability to manipulate language on different levels and deal with various types of wordplay. Previous research suggests that solving such puzzles is a challenge even for modern NLP models. However the abilities of large language models (LLMs) have not yet been tested on this task. In this paper we establish the benchmark results for three popular LLMs -- LLaMA2 Mistral and ChatGPT -- showing that their performance on this task is still far from that of humans.

Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often
rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom
encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions.
Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies,
but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of
long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware
token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization,
ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations
rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding
mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention
computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained
across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in
perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in
contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text
generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in
memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix
computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible
within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances
lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence
without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training
objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency
alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention
models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length
distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further
supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more
structured phrase generation.

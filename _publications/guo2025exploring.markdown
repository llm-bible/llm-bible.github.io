There has been extensive prior work exploring how psychological factors such
as anthropomorphism affect the adoption of shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs).
However, limited research has been conducted on how prompt strategies in large
language model (LLM)-powered SAV User Interfaces (UIs) affect users'
perceptions, experiences, and intentions to adopt such technology. In this
work, we investigate how conversational UIs powered by LLMs drive these
psychological factors and psychological ownership, the sense of possession a
user may come to feel towards an entity or object they may not legally own. We
designed four SAV UIs with varying levels of anthropomorphic characteristics
and psychological ownership triggers. Quantitative measures of psychological
ownership, anthropomorphism, quality of service, disclosure tendency, sentiment
of SAV responses, and overall acceptance were collected after participants
interacted with each SAV. Qualitative feedback was also gathered regarding the
experience of psychological ownership during the interactions. The results
indicate that an SAV conversational UI designed to be more anthropomorphic and
to induce psychological ownership improved users' perceptions of the SAV's
human-like qualities and improved the sentiment of responses compared to a
control condition. These findings provide practical guidance for designing
LLM-based conversational UIs that enhance user experience and adoption of SAVs.

Artificial intelligence has been around for a while, but suddenly it has
received more attention than ever before. Thanks to innovations from companies
like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other major brands in technology. OpenAI,
though, has triggered the button with its ground-breaking invention ChatGPT.
ChatGPT is a Large Language Model (LLM) based on Transformer architecture that
has the ability to generate human-like responses in a conversational context.
It uses deep learning algorithms to generate natural language responses to
input text. Its large number of parameters, contextual generation, and
open-domain training make it a versatile and effective tool for a wide range of
applications, from chatbots to customer service to language translation. It has
the potential to revolutionize various industries and transform the way we
interact with technology. However, the use of ChatGPT has also raised several
concerns, including ethical, social, and employment challenges, which must be
carefully considered to ensure the responsible use of this technology. The
article provides an overview of ChatGPT, delving into its architecture and
training process. It highlights the potential impacts of ChatGPT on the
society. In this paper, we suggest some approaches involving technology,
regulation, education, and ethics in an effort to maximize ChatGPT's benefits
while minimizing its negative impacts. This study is expected to contribute to
a greater understanding of ChatGPT and aid in predicting the potential changes
it may bring about.

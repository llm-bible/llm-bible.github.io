adaptNMT streamlines all processes involved in the development and deployment
of RNN and Transformer neural translation models. As an open-source
application, it is designed for both technical and non-technical users who work
in the field of machine translation. Built upon the widely-adopted OpenNMT
ecosystem, the application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field
since the setup of the development environment and creation of train,
validation and test splits is greatly simplified. Graphing, embedded within the
application, illustrates the progress of model training, and SentencePiece is
used for creating subword segmentation models. Hyperparameter customization is
facilitated through an intuitive user interface, and a single-click model
development approach has been implemented. Models developed by adaptNMT can be
evaluated using a range of metrics, and deployed as a translation service
within the application. To support eco-friendly research in the NLP space, a
green report also flags the power consumption and kgCO\\(_\{2\}\\) emissions
generated during model development. The application is freely available.

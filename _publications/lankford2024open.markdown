adaptNMT streamlines all processes involved in the development and deployment of RNN and Transformer neural translation models. As an open45;source application it is designed for both technical and non45;technical users who work in the field of machine translation. Built upon the widely45;adopted OpenNMT ecosystem the application is particularly useful for new entrants to the field since the setup of the development environment and creation of train validation and test splits is greatly simplified. Graphing embedded within the application illustrates the progress of model training and SentencePiece is used for creating subword segmentation models. Hyperparameter customization is facilitated through an intuitive user interface and a single45;click model development approach has been implemented. Models developed by adaptNMT can be evaluated using a range of metrics and deployed as a translation service within the application. To support eco45;friendly research in the NLP space a green report also flags the power consumption and kgCO95;123;2125; emissions generated during model development. The application is freely available.

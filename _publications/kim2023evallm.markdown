By simply composing prompts developers can prototype novel generative applications with Large Language Models (LLMs). To refine prototypes into products however developers must iteratively revise prompts by evaluating outputs to diagnose weaknesses. Formative interviews (N=8) revealed that developers invest significant effort in manually evaluating outputs as they assess context-specific and subjective criteria. We present EvalLM an interactive system for iteratively refining prompts by evaluating multiple outputs on user-defined criteria. By describing criteria in natural language users can employ the systems LLM-based evaluator to get an overview of where prompts excel or fail and improve these based on the evaluators feedback. A comparative study (N=12) showed that EvalLM when compared to manual evaluation helped participants compose more diverse criteria examine twice as many outputs and reach satisfactory prompts with 59 fewer revisions. Beyond prompts our work can be extended to augment model evaluation and alignment in specific application contexts.

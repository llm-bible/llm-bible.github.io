Conversational systems based on Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT show exceptional proficiency in context understanding and response generation. However despite their impressive capabilities they still possess limitations such as providing randomly-guessed answers to ambiguous queries or failing to refuse users requests both of which are considered aspects of a conversational agents proactivity. This raises the question of whether LLM-based conversational systems are equipped to handle proactive dialogue problems. In this work we conduct a comprehensive analysis of LLM-based conversational systems specifically focusing on three aspects of proactive dialogue systems clarification target-guided and non-collaborative dialogues. To trigger the proactivity of LLMs we propose the Proactive Chain-of-Thought prompting scheme which augments LLMs with the goal planning capability over descriptive reasoning chains. Empirical findings are discussed to promote future studies on LLM-based proactive dialogue systems.

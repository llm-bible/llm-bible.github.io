Conversational AI systems have emerged as key enablers of human-like interactions across diverse sectors. Nevertheless the balance between linguistic nuance and factual accuracy has proven elusive. In this paper we first introduce LLMXplorer a comprehensive tool that provides an in-depth review of over 150 Large Language Models (LLMs) elucidating their myriad implications ranging from social and ethical to regulatory as well as their applicability across industries. Building on this foundation we propose a novel functional architecture that seamlessly integrates the structured dynamics of Knowledge Graphs with the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. Validated using real-world AI news data our architecture adeptly blends linguistic sophistication with factual rigour and further strengthens data security through Role-Based Access Control. This research provides insights into the evolving landscape of conversational AI emphasizing the imperative for systems that are efficient transparent and trustworthy.

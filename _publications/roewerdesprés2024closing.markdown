We present a framework and benchmark suite for disentangling the commonsense grounding and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through controlled multi-hop counterfactuals. introduces formal elements to commonsense reasoning to explicitly control and quantify reasoning complexity beyond the typical 1 or 2 hops. Uniquely can automatically generate benchmarks of arbitrary reasoning complexity and so it scales with future LLM improvements. Benchmarking state-of-the-art LLMs -- including GPT-4o (2024-05-13) Llama-3-70B-Instruct and Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1 -- shows performance degrading to random chance with only moderate scaling leaving substantial headroom for improvement. We release a leaderboard of the benchmark suite tested in this work as well as code for automatically generating more complex benchmarks.

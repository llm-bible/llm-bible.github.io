Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable success in
various reasoning tasks in the field of natural language processing. This
success of LLMs has also motivated their use in graph-related tasks. Among
others, recent work has explored whether LLMs can solve graph problems such as
counting the number of connected components of a graph or computing the
shortest path distance between two nodes. Although LLMs possess preliminary
graph reasoning abilities, they might still struggle to solve some seemingly
simple problems. In this paper, we investigate whether prompting via
pseudo-code instructions can improve the performance of LLMs in solving graph
problems. Our experiments demonstrate that using pseudo-code instructions
generally improves the performance of all considered LLMs. The graphs,
pseudo-code prompts, and evaluation code are publicly available.

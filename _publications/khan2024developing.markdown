This paper presents an experience report on the development of Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using PDF documents as the primary data
source. The RAG architecture combines generative capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) with the precision of information retrieval. This approach has
the potential to redefine how we interact with and augment both structured and
unstructured knowledge in generative models to enhance transparency, accuracy,
and contextuality of responses. The paper details the end-to-end pipeline, from
data collection, preprocessing, to retrieval indexing and response generation,
highlighting technical challenges and practical solutions. We aim to offer
insights to researchers and practitioners developing similar systems using two
distinct approaches: OpenAI's Assistant API with GPT Series and Llama's
open-source models. The practical implications of this research lie in
enhancing the reliability of generative AI systems in various sectors where
domain-specific knowledge and real-time information retrieval is important. The
Python code used in this work is also available at:

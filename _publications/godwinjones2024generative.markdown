There are obvious benefits to integrating generative AI (artificial
intelligence) into language learning and teaching. Those include using AI as a
language tutor, creating learning materials, or assessing learner output.
However, due to how AI systems under-stand human language, based on a
mathematical model using statistical probability, they lack the lived
experience to be able to use language with the same social aware-ness as
humans. Additionally, there are built-in linguistic and cultural biases based
on their training data which is mostly in English and predominantly from
Western sources. Those facts limit AI suitability for some language learning
interactions. Stud-ies have clearly shown that systems such as ChatGPT often do
not produce language that is pragmatically appropriate. The lack of linguistic
and cultural authenticity has important implications for how AI is integrated
into second language acquisition as well as in instruction targeting
development of intercultural communication compe-tence.

In this paper we delve into the advancement of domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on their application in software development. We introduce DevAssistLlama a model developed through instruction tuning to assist developers in processing software-related natural language queries. This model a variant of instruction tuned LLM is particularly adept at handling intricate technical documentation enhancing developer capability in software specific tasks. The creation of DevAssistLlama involved constructing an extensive instruction dataset from various software systems enabling effective handling of Named Entity Recognition (NER) Relation Extraction (RE) and Link Prediction (LP). Our results demonstrate DevAssistLlamas superior capabilities in these tasks in comparison with other models including ChatGPT. This research not only highlights the potential of specialized LLMs in software development also the pioneer LLM for this domain.

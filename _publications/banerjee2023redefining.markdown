In this paper, we delve into the advancement of domain-specific Large
Language Models (LLMs) with a focus on their application in software
development. We introduce DevAssistLlama, a model developed through instruction
tuning, to assist developers in processing software-related natural language
queries. This model, a variant of instruction tuned LLM, is particularly adept
at handling intricate technical documentation, enhancing developer capability
in software specific tasks. The creation of DevAssistLlama involved
constructing an extensive instruction dataset from various software systems,
enabling effective handling of Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation
Extraction (RE), and Link Prediction (LP). Our results demonstrate
DevAssistLlama's superior capabilities in these tasks, in comparison with other
models including ChatGPT. This research not only highlights the potential of
specialized LLMs in software development also the pioneer LLM for this domain.

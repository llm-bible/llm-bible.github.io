MindScape aims to study the benefits of integrating time series behavioral patterns (e.g. conversational engagement sleep location) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a new form of contextual AI journaling promoting self45;reflection and well45;being. We argue that integrating behavioral sensing in LLMs will likely lead to a new frontier in AI. In this Late45;Breaking Work paper we discuss the MindScape contextual journal App design that uses LLMs and behavioral sensing to generate contextual and personalized journaling prompts crafted to encourage self45;reflection and emotional development. We also discuss the MindScape study of college students based on a preliminary user study and our upcoming study to assess the effectiveness of contextual AI journaling in promoting better well45;being on college campuses. MindScape represents a new application class that embeds behavioral intelligence in AI.

The success of ChatGPT has ignited an AI race with researchers striving to develop new large language models (LLMs) that can match or surpass the language understanding and generation abilities of commercial ones. In recent times a number of models have emerged claiming performance near that of GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 through various instruction-tuning methods. As practitioners of Text-to-SQL parsing we are grateful for their valuable contributions to open-source research. However it is important to approach these claims with a sense of scrutiny and ascertain the actual effectiveness of these models. Therefore we pit six popular large language models against each other systematically evaluating their Text-to-SQL parsing capability on nine benchmark datasets with five different prompting strategies covering both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Regrettably the open-sourced models fell significantly short of the performance achieved by closed-source models like GPT-3.5 highlighting the need for further work to bridge the performance gap between these models.

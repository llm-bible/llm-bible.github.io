This paper describes the results of the first shared task on the generation of teacher responses in educational dialogues. The goal of the task was to benchmark the ability of generative language models to act as AI teachers replying to a student in a teacher45;student dialogue. Eight teams participated in the competition hosted on CodaLab. They experimented with a wide variety of state45;of45;the45;art models including Alpaca Bloom DialoGPT DistilGPT45;2 Flan45;T5 GPT45;2 GPT45;3 GPT45; 4 LLaMA OPT45;2.7B and T545;base. Their submissions were automatically scored using BERTScore and DialogRPT metrics and the top three among them were further manually evaluated in terms of pedagogical ability based on Tack and Piech (2022). The NAISTeacher system which ranked first in both automated and human evaluation generated responses with GPT45;3.5 using an ensemble of prompts and a DialogRPT45;based ranking of responses for given dialogue contexts. Despite the promising achievements of the participating teams the results also highlight the need for evaluation metrics better suited to educational contexts.

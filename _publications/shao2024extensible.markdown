Large language models (LLMs) call for extension of context to handle many critical applications. However the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work we propose Extensible Embedding which realizes high-quality extension of LLMs context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective efficient flexible and compatible method to extend the LLMs context.

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have demonstrated superior performance on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including sentiment analysis mathematical reasoning and summarization. Furthermore since these models are instruction45;tuned on human conversations to produce helpful responses they can and often will produce explanations along with the response which we call self45;explanations. For example when analyzing the sentiment of a movie review the model may output not only the positivity of the sentiment but also an explanation (e.g. by listing the sentiment45;laden words such as fantastic and memorable in the review). How good are these automatically generated self45;explanations In this paper we investigate this question on the task of sentiment analysis and for feature attribution explanation one of the most commonly studied settings in the interpretability literature (for pre45;ChatGPT models). Specifically we study different ways to elicit the self45;explanations evaluate their faithfulness on a set of evaluation metrics and compare them to traditional explanation methods such as occlusion or LIME saliency maps. Through an extensive set of experiments we find that ChatGPTs self45;explanations perform on par with traditional ones but are quite different from them according to various agreement metrics meanwhile being much cheaper to produce (as they are generated along with the prediction). In addition we identified several interesting characteristics of them which prompt us to rethink many current model interpretability practices in the era of ChatGPT(45;like) LLMs.

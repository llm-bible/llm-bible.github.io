Resolving the dichotomy between the human45;like yet constrained reasoning processes of Cognitive Architectures and the broad but often noisy inference behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains a challenging but exciting pursuit for enabling reliable machine reasoning capabilities in production systems. Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision45;making at a computational level new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes e.g. guided perception memory goal45;setting and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision45;making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference 45;45; reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges we introduce LLM45;ACTR a novel neuro45;symbolic architecture that provides human45;aligned and versatile decision45;making by integrating the ACT45;R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT45;Rs internal decision45;making process as latent neural representations injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers and fine45;tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision45;making capability of our approach compared to LLM45;only baselines that leverage chain45;of45;thought reasoning strategies.

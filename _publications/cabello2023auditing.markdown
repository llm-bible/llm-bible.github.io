The recently released ChatGPT model demonstrates unprecedented capabilities
in zero-shot question-answering. In this work, we probe ChatGPT for its
conversational understanding and introduce a conversational framework
(protocol) that can be adopted in future studies. The Pok\'emon universe serves
as an ideal testing ground for auditing ChatGPT's reasoning capabilities due to
its closed world assumption. After bringing ChatGPT's background knowledge (on
the Pok\'emon universe) to light, we test its reasoning process when using
these concepts in battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability to acquire new
knowledge and include it in its reasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to
assess ChatGPT's ability to generalize, combine features, and to acquire and
reason over newly introduced knowledge from human feedback. We find that
ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe, which can reason upon in
battle scenarios to a great extent, even when new information is introduced.
The model performs better with collaborative feedback and if there is an
initial phase of information retrieval, but also hallucinates occasionally and
is susceptible to adversarial attacks.

Visual Question Answering (VQA) models play a critical role in enhancing the
perception capabilities of autonomous driving systems by allowing vehicles to
analyze visual inputs alongside textual queries, fostering natural interaction
and trust between the vehicle and its occupants or other road users. This study
investigates the attention patterns of humans compared to a VQA model when
answering driving-related questions, revealing disparities in the objects
observed. We propose an approach integrating filters to optimize the model's
attention mechanisms, prioritizing relevant objects and improving accuracy.
Utilizing the LXMERT model for a case study, we compare attention patterns of
the pre-trained and Filter Integrated models, alongside human answers using
images from the NuImages dataset, gaining insights into feature prioritization.
We evaluated the models using a Subjective scoring framework which shows that
the integration of the feature encoder filter has enhanced the performance of
the VQA model by refining its attention mechanisms.

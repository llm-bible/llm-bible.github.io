In this paper we introduce PixArt45;Sigma a Diffusion Transformer model~(DiT) capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution. PixArt45;Sigma represents a significant advancement over its predecessor PixArt45;α offering images of markedly higher fidelity and improved alignment with text prompts. A key feature of PixArt45;Sigma is its training efficiency. Leveraging the foundational pre45;training of PixArt45;α it evolves from the weaker baseline to a stronger model via incorporating higher quality data a process we term weak45;to45;strong training. The advancements in PixArt45;Sigma are twofold (1) High45;Quality Training Data PixArt45;Sigma incorporates superior45;quality image data paired with more precise and detailed image captions. (2) Efficient Token Compression we propose a novel attention module within the DiT framework that compresses both keys and values significantly improving efficiency and facilitating ultra45;high45;resolution image generation. Thanks to these improvements PixArt45;Sigma achieves superior image quality and user prompt adherence capabilities with significantly smaller model size (0.6B parameters) than existing text45;to45;image diffusion models such as SDXL (2.6B parameters) and SD Cascade (5.1B parameters). Moreover PixArt45;Sigmas capability to generate 4K images supports the creation of high45;resolution posters and wallpapers efficiently bolstering the production of high45;quality visual content in industries such as film and gaming.

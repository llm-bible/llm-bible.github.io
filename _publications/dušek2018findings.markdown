This paper summarises the experimental setup and results of the first shared
task on end-to-end (E2E) natural language generation (NLG) in spoken dialogue
systems. Recent end-to-end generation systems are promising since they reduce
the need for data annotation. However, they are currently limited to small,
delexicalised datasets. The E2E NLG shared task aims to assess whether these
novel approaches can generate better-quality output by learning from a dataset
containing higher lexical richness, syntactic complexity and diverse discourse
phenomena. We compare 62 systems submitted by 17 institutions, covering a wide
range of approaches, including machine learning architectures -- with the
majority implementing sequence-to-sequence models (seq2seq) -- as well as
systems based on grammatical rules and templates.

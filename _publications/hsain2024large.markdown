This research explores the integration of chatbot technology powered by
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Turbo into higher education to enhance internationalization
and leverage digital transformation. It delves into the design, implementation,
and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for improving student
engagement, information access, and support. Utilizing technologies like Python
3, GPT API, LangChain, and Chroma Vector Store, the research emphasizes
creating a high-quality, timely, and relevant transcript dataset for chatbot
testing. Findings indicate the chatbot's efficacy in providing comprehensive
responses, its preference over traditional methods by users, and a low error
rate. Highlighting the chatbot's real-time engagement, memory capabilities, and
critical data access, the study demonstrates its potential to elevate
accessibility, efficiency, and satisfaction. Concluding, the research suggests
the chatbot significantly aids higher education internationalization, proposing
further investigation into digital technology's role in educational enhancement
and strategy development.

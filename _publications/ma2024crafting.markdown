In the domain of digital information dissemination, search engines act as
pivotal conduits linking information seekers with providers. The advent of
chat-based search engines utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG), exemplified by Bing Chat, marks an evolutionary
leap in the search ecosystem. They demonstrate metacognitive abilities in
interpreting web information and crafting responses with human-like
understanding and creativity. Nonetheless, the intricate nature of LLMs renders
their "cognitive" processes opaque, challenging even their designers'
understanding. This research aims to dissect the mechanisms through which an
LLM-powered chat-based search engine, specifically Bing Chat, selects
information sources for its responses. To this end, an extensive dataset has
been compiled through engagements with New Bing, documenting the websites it
cites alongside those listed by the conventional search engine. Employing
natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the research reveals that Bing
Chat exhibits a preference for content that is not only readable and formally
structured, but also demonstrates lower perplexity levels, indicating a unique
inclination towards text that is predictable by the underlying LLM. Further
enriching our analysis, we procure an additional dataset through interactions
with the GPT-4 based knowledge retrieval API, unveiling a congruent text
preference between the RAG API and Bing Chat. This consensus suggests that
these text preferences intrinsically emerge from the underlying language
models, rather than being explicitly crafted by Bing Chat's developers.
Moreover, our investigation documents a greater similarity among websites cited
by RAG technologies compared to those ranked highest by conventional search
engines.

Artificial Intelligence has outperformed human experts in functional tasks
such as chess and baduk. How about creative tasks? This paper evaluates AI's
capability in the creative domain compared to human experts, which little
research has been conducted so far. We propose a novel Prompt-for-Prompt to
generate social media creatives via prompt augmentation by Large Language
Models. We take the most popular Instagram posts (with the biggest number of
like clicks) in top brands' Instagram accounts to create social media
creatives. We give GPT 4 several prompt instructions with text descriptions to
generate the most effective prompts for cutting-edge text-to-image generators:
Midjourney, DALL E 3, and Stable Diffusion. LLM-augmented prompts can boost
AI's abilities by adding objectives, engagement strategy, lighting and brand
consistency for social media image creation. We conduct an extensive human
evaluation experiment, and find that AI excels human experts, and Midjourney is
better than the other text-to-image generators. Surprisingly, unlike
conventional wisdom in the social media industry, prompt instruction including
eye-catching shows much poorer performance than those including natural.
Regarding the type of creatives, AI improves creatives with animals or products
but less with real people. Also, AI improves creatives with short text
descriptions more than with long text descriptions, because there is more room
for AI to augment prompts with shorter descriptions.

We present ShieldGemma a comprehensive suite of LLM45;based safety content moderation models built upon Gemma2. These models provide robust state45;of45;the45;art predictions of safety risks across key harm types (sexually explicit dangerous content harassment hate speech) in both user input and LLM45;generated output. By evaluating on both public and internal benchmarks we demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models such as Llama Guard (+10.837; AU45;PRC on public benchmarks) and WildCard (+4.337;). Additionally we present a novel LLM45;based data curation pipeline adaptable to a variety of safety45;related tasks and beyond. We have shown strong generalization performance for model trained mainly on synthetic data. By releasing ShieldGemma we provide a valuable resource to the research community advancing LLM safety and enabling the creation of more effective content moderation solutions for developers.

We introduce dodecaDialogue a set of 12 tasks that measures if a conversational agent can communicate engagingly with personality and empathy ask questions answer questions by utilizing knowledge resources discuss topics and situations and perceive and converse about images. By multi45;tasking on such a broad large45;scale set of data we hope to both move towards and measure progress in producing a single unified agent that can perceive reason and converse with humans in an open45;domain setting. We show that such multi45;tasking improves over a BERT pre45;trained baseline largely due to multi45;tasking with very large dialogue datasets in a similar domain and that the multi45;tasking in general provides gains to both text and image45;based tasks using several metrics in both the fine45;tune and task transfer settings. We obtain state45;of45;the45;art results on many of the tasks providing a strong baseline for this challenge.

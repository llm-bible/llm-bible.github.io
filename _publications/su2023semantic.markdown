ChatGPT has garnered significant interest due to its impressive performance;
however, there is growing concern about its potential risks, particularly in
the detection of AI-generated content (AIGC), which is often challenging for
untrained individuals to identify. Current datasets used for detecting
ChatGPT-generated text primarily focus on question-answering tasks, often
overlooking tasks with semantic-invariant properties, such as summarization,
translation, and paraphrasing. In this paper, we demonstrate that detecting
model-generated text in semantic-invariant tasks is more challenging. To
address this gap, we introduce a more extensive and comprehensive dataset that
incorporates a wider range of tasks than previous work, including those with
semantic-invariant properties. In addition, instruction fine-tuning has
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks. In this paper, we
explore the use of instruction fine-tuning models for detecting text generated
by ChatGPT.

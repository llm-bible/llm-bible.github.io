ChatGPT has garnered significant interest due to its impressive performance; however there is growing concern about its potential risks particularly in the detection of AI45;generated content (AIGC) which is often challenging for untrained individuals to identify. Current datasets used for detecting ChatGPT45;generated text primarily focus on question45;answering tasks often overlooking tasks with semantic45;invariant properties such as summarization translation and paraphrasing. In this paper we demonstrate that detecting model45;generated text in semantic45;invariant tasks is more challenging. To address this gap we introduce a more extensive and comprehensive dataset that incorporates a wider range of tasks than previous work including those with semantic45;invariant properties.

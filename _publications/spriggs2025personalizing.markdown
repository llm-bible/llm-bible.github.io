The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) marks a
transformative era in technology, especially within the educational sector.
This paper explores the integration of LLMs within learning management systems
(LMSs) to develop an adaptive learning management system (ALMS) personalized
for individual learners across various educational stages. Traditional LMSs,
while facilitating the distribution of educational materials, fall short in
addressing the nuanced needs of diverse student populations, particularly in
settings with limited instructor availability. Our proposed system leverages
the flexibility of AI to provide a customizable learning environment that
adjusts to each user's evolving needs. By integrating a suite of
general-purpose and domain-specific LLMs, this system aims to minimize common
issues such as factual inaccuracies and outdated information, characteristic of
general LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT. This paper details the development of an
ALMS that not only addresses privacy concerns and the limitations of existing
educational tools but also enhances the learning experience by maintaining
engagement through personalized educational content.

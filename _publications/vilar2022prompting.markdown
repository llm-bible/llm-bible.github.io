Large language models (LLMs) that have been trained on multilingual but not parallel text exhibit a remarkable ability to translate between languages. We probe this ability in an in-depth study of the pathways language model (PaLM) which has demonstrated the strongest machine translation (MT) performance among similarly-trained LLMs to date. We investigate various strategies for choosing translation examples for few-shot prompting concluding that example quality is the most important factor. Using optimized prompts we revisit previous assessments of PaLMs MT capabilities with more recent test sets modern MT metrics and human evaluation and find that its performance while impressive still lags that of state-of-the-art supervised systems. We conclude by providing an analysis of PaLMs MT output which reveals some interesting properties and prospects for future work.

In the field of Japanese45;Chinese translation linguistics the issue of correctly translating attributive clauses has persistently proven to be challenging. Present45;day machine translation tools often fail to accurately translate attributive clauses from Japanese to Chinese. In light of this this paper investigates the linguistic problem underlying such difficulties namely how does the semantic role of the modified noun affect the selection of translation patterns for attributive clauses from a linguistic perspective. To ad45;dress these difficulties a pre45;edit scheme is proposed which aims to enhance the accuracy of translation. Furthermore we propose a novel two45;step prompt strategy which combines this pre45;edit scheme with ChatGPT currently the most widely used large language model. This prompt strategy is capable of optimizing translation input in zero45;shot scenarios and has been demonstrated to improve the average translation accuracy score by over 3537;.

This paper proposes a novel end45;to45;end architecture for task45;oriented dialogue systems. It is based on a simple and practical yet very effective sequence45;to45;sequence approach where language understanding and state tracking tasks are modeled jointly with a structured copy45;augmented sequential decoder and a multi45;label decoder for each slot. The policy engine and language generation tasks are modeled jointly following that. The copy45;augmented sequential decoder deals with new or unknown values in the conversation while the multi45;label decoder combined with the sequential decoder ensures the explicit assignment of values to slots. On the generation part slot binary classifiers are used to improve performance. This architecture is scalable to real45;world scenarios and is shown through an empirical evaluation to achieve state45;of45;the45;art performance on both the Cambridge Restaurant dataset and the Stanford in45;car assistant datasetfootnote123;The code is available at url123;https://github.com/uber&#45;research/FSDM&#125;&#125;

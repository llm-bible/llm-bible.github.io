Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare
require advanced clinical skills (CS), yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate
these comprehensively. We introduce MedQA-CS, an AI-SCE framework inspired by
medical education's Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), to
address this gap. MedQA-CS evaluates LLMs through two instruction-following
tasks, LLM-as-medical-student and LLM-as-CS-examiner, designed to reflect real
clinical scenarios. Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a
comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert
annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs
as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a
more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional
multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks,
MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities
for both open- and closed-source LLMs.

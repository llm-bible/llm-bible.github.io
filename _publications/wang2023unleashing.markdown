Human intelligence thrives on cognitive synergy, where collaboration among
different minds yield superior outcomes compared to isolated individuals. In
this work, we propose Solo Performance Prompting (SPP), which transforms a
single LLM into a cognitive synergist by engaging in multi-turn
self-collaboration with multiple personas. A cognitive synergist is an
intelligent agent that collaboratively combines multiple minds' strengths and
knowledge to enhance problem-solving in complex tasks. By dynamically
identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP
unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. Our in-depth analysis
shows that assigning multiple fine-grained personas in LLMs improves
problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of
personas. We evaluate SPP on three challenging tasks: Trivia Creative Writing,
Codenames Collaborative, and Logic Grid Puzzle, encompassing both
knowledge-intensive and reasoning-intensive types. Unlike previous works, such
as Chain-of-Thought, that solely enhance the reasoning abilities in LLMs,
experimental results demonstrate that SPP effectively reduces factual
hallucination, and maintains strong reasoning capabilities. Additionally,
comparative experiments show that cognitive synergy only emerges in GPT-4 and
does not appear in less capable models, such as GPT-3.5-turbo and
Llama2-13b-chat, which draws an interesting analogy to human development. Code,

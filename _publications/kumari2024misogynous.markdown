In recent years, there has been a significant rise in the phenomenon of hate
against women on social media platforms, particularly through the use of
misogynous memes. These memes often target women with subtle and obscure cues,
making their detection a challenging task for automated systems. Recently,
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in reasoning using
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to generate the intermediate reasoning chains
as the rationale to facilitate multimodal tasks, but often neglect cultural
diversity and key aspects like emotion and contextual knowledge hidden in the
visual modalities. To address this gap, we introduce a Multimodal Multi-hop CoT
(M3Hop-CoT) framework for Misogynous meme identification, combining a
CLIP-based classifier and a multimodal CoT module with
entity-object-relationship integration. M3Hop-CoT employs a three-step
multimodal prompting principle to induce emotions, target awareness, and
contextual knowledge for meme analysis. Our empirical evaluation, including
both qualitative and quantitative analysis, validates the efficacy of the
M3Hop-CoT framework on the SemEval-2022 Task 5 (MAMI task) dataset,
highlighting its strong performance in the macro-F1 score. Furthermore, we
evaluate the model's generalizability by evaluating it on various benchmark
meme datasets, offering a thorough insight into the effectiveness of our
approach across different datasets.

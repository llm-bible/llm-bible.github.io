ChatGPT, powered by a large language model (LLM), has revolutionized everyday
human-computer interaction (HCI) since its 2022 release. While now used by
millions around the world, a coherent pathway for evaluating the user
experience (UX) ChatGPT offers remains missing. In this rapid review (N = 58),
I explored how ChatGPT UX has been approached quantitatively so far. I focused
on the independent variables (IVs) manipulated, the dependent variables (DVs)
measured, and the methods used for measurement. Findings reveal trends, gaps,
and emerging consensus in UX assessments. This work offers a first step towards
synthesizing existing approaches to measuring ChatGPT UX, urgent trajectories
to advance standardization and breadth, and two preliminary frameworks aimed at
guiding future research and tool development. I seek to elevate the field of
ChatGPT UX by empowering researchers and practitioners in optimizing user
interactions with ChatGPT and similar LLM-based systems.

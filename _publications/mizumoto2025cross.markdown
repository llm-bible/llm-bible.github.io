Multilingual large language models (LLMs) face an often-overlooked challenge
stemming from intrinsic semantic differences across languages. Linguistic
divergence can sometimes lead to cross-linguistic disagreements--disagreements
purely due to semantic differences about a relevant concept. This paper
identifies such disagreements as conflicts between two fundamental alignment
norms in multilingual LLMs: cross-linguistic consistency (CL-consistency),
which seeks universal concepts across languages, and consistency with folk
judgments (Folk-consistency), which respects language-specific semantic norms.
Through examining responses of conversational multilingual AIs in English and
Japanese with the cases used in philosophy (cases of knowledge-how
attributions), this study demonstrates that even state-of-the-art LLMs provide
divergent and internally inconsistent responses. Such findings reveal a novel
qualitative limitation in crosslingual knowledge transfer, or conceptual
crosslingual knowledge barriers, challenging the assumption that universal
representations and cross-linguistic transfer capabilities are inherently
desirable. Moreover, they reveal conflicts of alignment policies of their
developers, highlighting critical normative questions for LLM researchers and
developers. The implications extend beyond technical alignment challenges,
raising normative, moral-political, and metaphysical questions about the ideals
underlying AI development--questions that are shared with philosophers and
cognitive scientists but for which no one yet has definitive answers, inviting
a multidisciplinary approach to balance the practical benefits of
cross-linguistic consistency and respect for linguistic diversity.

Recent speech language models (SLMs) typically incorporate pre-trained speech
models to extend the capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this
paper, we propose a Descriptive Speech-Text Alignment approach that leverages
speech captioning to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities,
enabling SLMs to interpret and generate comprehensive natural language
descriptions, thereby facilitating the capability to understand both linguistic
and non-linguistic features in speech. Enhanced with the proposed approach, our
model demonstrates superior performance on the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark,
particularly in generalizing to unseen tasks. Moreover, we discover that the
aligned model exhibits a zero-shot instruction-following capability without
explicit speech instruction tuning. These findings highlight the potential to
reshape instruction-following SLMs by incorporating rich, descriptive speech
captions.

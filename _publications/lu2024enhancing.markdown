Recent speech language models (SLMs) typically incorporate pre45;trained speech models to extend the capabilities from large language models (LLMs). In this paper we propose a Descriptive Speech45;Text Alignment approach that leverages speech captioning to bridge the gap between speech and text modalities enabling SLMs to interpret and generate comprehensive natural language descriptions thereby facilitating the capability to understand both linguistic and non45;linguistic features in speech. Enhanced with the proposed approach our model demonstrates superior performance on the Dynamic45;SUPERB benchmark particularly in generalizing to unseen tasks. Moreover we discover that the aligned model exhibits a zero45;shot instruction45;following capability without explicit speech instruction tuning. These findings highlight the potential to reshape instruction45;following SLMs by incorporating rich descriptive speech captions.

Multi45;hop reading comprehension (MHRC) requires not only to predict the correct answer span in the given passage but also to provide a chain of supporting evidences for reasoning interpretability. It is natural to model such a process into graph structure by understanding multi45;hop reasoning as jumping over entity nodes which has made graph modelling dominant on this task. Recently there have been dissenting voices about whether graph modelling is indispensable due to the inconvenience of the graph building however existing state45;of45;the45;art graph45;free attempts suffer from huge performance gap compared to graph45;based ones. This work presents a novel graph45;free alternative which firstly outperform all graph models on MHRC. In detail we exploit a select45;to45;guide (S2G) strategy to accurately retrieve evidence paragraphs in a coarse45;to45;fine manner incorporated with two novel attention mechanisms which surprisingly shows conforming to the nature of multi45;hop reasoning. Our graph45;free model achieves significant and consistent performance gain over strong baselines and the current new state45;of45;the45;art on the MHRC benchmark HotpotQA among all the published works.

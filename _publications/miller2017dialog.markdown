We introduce ParlAI (pronounced "par-lay"), an open-source software platform
for dialog research implemented in Python, available at http://parl.ai. Its
goal is to provide a unified framework for sharing, training and testing of
dialog models, integration of Amazon Mechanical Turk for data collection, human
evaluation, and online/reinforcement learning; and a repository of machine
learning models for comparing with others' models, and improving upon existing
architectures. Over 20 tasks are supported in the first release, including
popular datasets such as SQuAD, bAbI tasks, MCTest, WikiQA, QACNN, QADailyMail,
CBT, bAbI Dialog, Ubuntu, OpenSubtitles and VQA. Several models are integrated,
including neural models such as memory networks, seq2seq and attentive LSTMs.

The robotic intervention for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
has generally used pre-defined scripts to deliver verbal content during
one-to-one therapy sessions. This practice restricts the use of robots to
limited, pre-mediated instructional curricula. In this paper, we increase robot
autonomy in one such robotic intervention for children with ASD by implementing
perspective-taking teaching. Our approach uses large language models (LLM) to
generate verbal content as texts and then deliver it to the child via robotic
speech. In the proposed pipeline, we teach perspective-taking through which our
robot takes up three roles: initiator, prompter, and reinforcer. We adopted the
GPT-2 + BART pipelines to generate social situations, ask questions (as
initiator), and give options (as prompter) when required. The robot encourages
the child by giving positive reinforcement for correct answers (as a
reinforcer). In addition to our technical contribution, we conducted ten-minute
sessions with domain experts simulating an actual perspective teaching session,
with the researcher acting as a child participant. These sessions validated our
robotic intervention pipeline through surveys, including those from NASA TLX
and GodSpeed. We used BERTScore to compare our GPT-2 + BART pipeline with an
all GPT-2 and found the performance of the former to be better. Based on the
responses by the domain experts, the robot session demonstrated higher
performance with no additional increase in mental or physical demand, temporal
demand, effort, or frustration compared to a no-robot session. We also
concluded that the domain experts perceived the robot as ideally safe, likable,
and reliable.

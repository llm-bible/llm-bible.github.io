The Incomplete Utterance Rewriting (IUR) task has garnered significant
attention in recent years. Its goal is to reconstruct conversational utterances
to better align with the current context, thereby enhancing comprehension. In
this paper, we introduce a novel and versatile lightweight method,
Rewritten-Sampled MLP (RSMLP). By employing an MLP based architecture with a
carefully designed down-sampling strategy, RSMLP effectively extracts latent
semantic information between utterances and makes appropriate edits to restore
incomplete utterances. Due to its simple yet efficient structure, our method
achieves competitive performance on public IUR datasets and in real-world
applications.

In the era of artificial intelligence data is gold but costly to annotate. The paper demonstrates a groundbreaking solution to this dilemma using ChatGPT for text augmentation in sentiment analysis. We leverage ChatGPTs generative capabilities to create synthetic training data that significantly improves the performance of smaller models making them competitive with or even outperforming their larger counterparts. This innovation enables models to be both efficient and effective thereby reducing computational cost inference time and memory usage without compromising on quality. Our work marks a key advancement in the cost-effective development and deployment of robust sentiment analysis models.

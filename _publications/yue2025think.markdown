Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable embodied agents to follow
natural language instructions and reach target locations in real-world
environments. While prior methods often rely on either global scene
representations or object-level features, these approaches are insufficient for
capturing the complex interactions across modalities required for accurate
navigation. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level Fusion and Reasoning
Architecture (MFRA) to enhance the agent's ability to reason over visual
observations, language instructions and navigation history. Specifically, MFRA
introduces a hierarchical fusion mechanism that aggregates multi-level
features-ranging from low-level visual cues to high-level semantic
concepts-across multiple modalities. We further design a reasoning module that
leverages fused representations to infer navigation actions through
instruction-guided attention and dynamic context integration. By selectively
capturing and combining relevant visual, linguistic, and temporal signals, MFRA
improves decision-making accuracy in complex navigation scenarios. Extensive
experiments on benchmark VLN datasets including REVERIE, R2R, and SOON
demonstrate that MFRA achieves superior performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of multi-level modal
fusion for embodied navigation.

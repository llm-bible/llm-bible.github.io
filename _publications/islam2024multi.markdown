Code synthesis which requires a deep understanding of complex natural language problem descriptions generation of code instructions for complex algorithms and data structures and the successful execution of comprehensive unit tests presents a significant challenge. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive proficiency in natural language processing their performance in code generation tasks remains limited. In this paper we introduce a new approach to code generation tasks leveraging multi45;agent prompting that uniquely replicates the full cycle of program synthesis as observed in human developers. Our framework MapCoder consists of four LLM agents specifically designed to emulate the stages of this cycle recalling relevant examples planning code generation and debugging. After conducting thorough experiments with multiple LLM ablations and analyses across eight challenging competitive problem45;solving and program synthesis benchmarks MapCoder showcases remarkable code generation capabilities achieving new state45;of45;the45;art results (pass35;64;1) on HumanEval (93.937;) MBPP (83.137;) APPS (22.037;) CodeContests (28.537;) and xCodeEval (45.337;). Moreover our method consistently delivers superior performance across various programming languages and varying problem difficulties.

Recently various methods have been proposed to create open45;domain conversational agents with Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are able to answer user queries but in a one45;way Qamp;A format rather than a true conversation. Fine45;tuning on particular datasets is the usual way to modify their style to increase conversational ability but this is expensive and usually only available in a few languages. In this study we explore role45;play zero45;shot prompting as an efficient and cost45;effective solution for open45;domain conversation using capable multilingual LLMs (Beeching et al. 2023) trained to obey instructions. We design a prompting system that when combined with an instruction45;following model 45; here Vicuna (Chiang et al. 2023) 45; produces conversational agents that match and even surpass fine45;tuned models in human evaluation in French in two different tasks.

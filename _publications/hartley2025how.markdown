Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
necessitating a deeper understanding of their decision-making behaviour under
risk. This study investigates the relationship between LLMs' personality traits
and risk propensity, employing cumulative prospect theory (CPT) and the Big
Five personality framework. We focus on GPT-4o, comparing its behaviour to
human baselines and earlier models. Our findings reveal that GPT-4o exhibits
higher Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits compared to human averages,
while functioning as a risk-neutral rational agent in prospect selection.
Interventions on GPT-4o's Big Five traits, particularly Openness, significantly
influence its risk propensity, mirroring patterns observed in human studies.
Notably, Openness emerges as the most influential factor in GPT-4o's risk
propensity, aligning with human findings. In contrast, legacy models like
GPT-4-Turbo demonstrate inconsistent generalization of the personality-risk
relationship. This research advances our understanding of LLM behaviour under
risk and elucidates the potential and limitations of personality-based
interventions in shaping LLM decision-making. Our findings have implications
for the development of more robust and predictable AI systems such as financial
modelling.

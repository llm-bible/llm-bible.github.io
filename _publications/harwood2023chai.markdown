This paper explores the potential for utilizing generative AI models in group-focused co-creative frameworks to enhance problem solving and ideation in business innovation and co-creation contexts and proposes a novel prompting technique for conversational generative AI agents which employ methods inspired by traditional human-to-human facilitation and instruction to enable active contribution to Design Thinking a co-creative framework. Through experiments using this prompting technique we gather evidence that conversational generative transformers (i.e. ChatGPT) have the capability to contribute context-specific useful and creative input into Design Thinking activities. We also discuss the potential benefits limitations and risks associated with using generative AI models in co-creative ideation and provide recommendations for future research.

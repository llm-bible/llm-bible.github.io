This paper explores the potential for utilizing generative AI models in group45;focused co45;creative frameworks to enhance problem solving and ideation in business innovation and co45;creation contexts and proposes a novel prompting technique for conversational generative AI agents which employ methods inspired by traditional human45;to45;human facilitation and instruction to enable active contribution to Design Thinking a co45;creative framework. Through experiments using this prompting technique we gather evidence that conversational generative transformers (i.e. ChatGPT) have the capability to contribute context45;specific useful and creative input into Design Thinking activities. We also discuss the potential benefits limitations and risks associated with using generative AI models in co45;creative ideation and provide recommendations for future research.

The success of transformer models trained with a language modeling objective brings a promising opportunity to the reinforcement learning framework. Decision Transformer is a step towards this direction showing how to train transformers with a similar next45;step prediction objective on offline data. Another important development in this area is the recent emergence of large45;scale datasets collected from the internet such as the ones composed of tutorial videos with captions where people talk about what they are doing. To take advantage of this language component we propose a novel method for unifying language reasoning with actions in a single policy. Specifically we augment a transformer policy with word outputs so it can generate textual captions interleaved with actions. When tested on the most challenging task in BabyAI with captions describing next subgoals our reasoning policy consistently outperforms the caption45;free baseline.

Large language models of artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, find
remarkable but controversial applicability in science and research. This paper
reviews epistemological challenges, ethical and integrity risks in science
conduct in the advent of generative AI. This is with the aim to lay new timely
foundations for a high-quality research ethics review. The role of AI language
models as a research instrument and subject is scrutinized along with ethical
implications for scientists, participants and reviewers. New emerging practices
for research ethics review are discussed, concluding with ten recommendations
that shape a response for a more responsible research conduct in the era of AI.

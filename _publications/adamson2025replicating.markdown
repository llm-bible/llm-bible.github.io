Validating Large Language Models with ReLM explores the application of formal
languages to evaluate and control Large Language Models (LLMs) for
memorization, bias, and zero-shot performance. Current approaches for
evaluating these types behavior are often slow, imprecise, costly, or introduce
biases of their own, but are necessary due to the importance of this behavior
when productionizing LLMs. This project reproduces key results from the
original ReLM paper and expounds on the approach and applications with an
emphasis on the relevance to the field of systems for machine learning.

Large language models are limited by challenges in factuality and hallucinations to be directly employed off45;the45;shelf for judging the veracity of news articles where factual accuracy is paramount. In this work we propose DELL that identifies three key stages in misinformation detection where LLMs could be incorporated as part of the pipeline 1) LLMs could emph123;generate news reactions125; to represent diverse perspectives and simulate user45;news interaction networks; 2) LLMs could emph123;generate explanations125; for proxy tasks (e.g. sentiment stance) to enrich the contexts of news articles and produce experts specializing in various aspects of news understanding; 3) LLMs could emph123;merge task45;specific experts125; and provide an overall prediction by incorporating the predictions and confidence scores of varying experts. Extensive experiments on seven datasets with three LLMs demonstrate that DELL outperforms state45;of45;the45;art baselines by up to 16.837; in macro f145;score. Further analysis reveals that the generated reactions and explanations are greatly helpful in misinformation detection while our proposed LLM45;guided expert merging helps produce better45;calibrated predictions.

While large language models exhibit remarkable performance in the Question Answering task they are susceptible to hallucinations. Challenges arise when these models grapple with understanding multi45;hop relations in complex questions or lack the necessary knowledge for a comprehensive response. To address this issue we introduce the Decompose45;and45;Query framework (Damp;Q). This framework guides the model to think and utilize external knowledge similar to ReAct while also restricting its thinking to reliable information effectively mitigating the risk of hallucinations. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of Damp;Q On our ChitChatQA dataset Damp;Q does not lose to ChatGPT in 6737; of cases; on the HotPotQA question45;only setting Damp;Q achieved an F1 score of 59.637;. Our code is available at https://github.com/alkaidpku/DQ&#45;ToolQA.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) with relevant retrieved passages reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks. However contemporary RAG approaches suffer from irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues in complex domain questions (e.g. HotPot QA) due to the lack of corresponding domain knowledge leading to low-quality generations. To address this issue we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally we demonstrate DuetRAG s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.

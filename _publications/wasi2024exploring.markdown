Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is crucial for improving safety,
reliability, and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM
designs often lack this integration, resulting in systems that may not fully
align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. This oversight
exacerbates biases in LLM outputs and leads to suboptimal user experiences due
to inconsistent application of user-centered design principles. Researchers are
increasingly leveraging NLP, particularly LLMs, to model and understand human
behavior across social sciences, psychology, psychiatry, health, and
neuroscience. Our position paper explores the need to integrate cognitive
ergonomics into LLM design, providing a comprehensive framework and practical
guidelines for ethical development. By addressing these challenges, we aim to
advance safer, more reliable, and ethically sound human-AI interactions.

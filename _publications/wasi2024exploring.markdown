Integrating cognitive ergonomics with LLMs is essential for enhancing safety reliability and user satisfaction in human-AI interactions. Current LLM design often lacks this integration leading to systems that may not fully align with human cognitive capabilities and limitations. Insufficient focus on incorporating cognitive science methods exacerbates biases in LLM outputs while inconsistent application of user-centered design principles results in sub-optimal user experiences. To address these challenges our position paper explores the critical integration of cognitive ergonomics principles into LLM design aiming to provide a comprehensive framework and practical guidelines for ethical LLM development. Through our contributions we seek to advance understanding and practice in integrating cognitive ergonomics into LLM systems fostering safer more reliable and ethically sound human-AI interactions.

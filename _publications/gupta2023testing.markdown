With the recent developments in large language models (LLMs) and their widespread availability through open source models and/or low-cost APIs several exciting products and applications are emerging many of which are in the field of STEM educational technology for K-12 and university students. There is a need to evaluate these powerful language models on several benchmarks in order to understand their risks and limitations. In this short paper we summarize and analyze the performance of Bard a popular LLM-based conversational service made available by Google on the standardized Physics GRE examination.

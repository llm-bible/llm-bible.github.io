This paper presents the design and initial assessment of a novel device that
uses generative AI to facilitate creative ideation, inspiration, and reflective
thought. Inspired by magnetic poetry, which was originally designed to help
overcome writer's block, the device allows participants to compose short poetic
texts from a limited vocabulary by physically placing words on the device's
surface. Upon composing the text, the system employs a large language model
(LLM) to generate a response, displayed on an e-ink screen. We explored various
strategies for internally sequencing prompts to foster creative thinking,
including analogy, allegorical interpretations, and ideation. We installed the
device in our research laboratory for two weeks and held a focus group at the
conclusion to evaluate the design. The design choice to limit interactions with
the LLM to poetic text, coupled with the tactile experience of assembling the
poem, fostered a deeper and more enjoyable engagement with the LLM compared to
traditional chatbot or screen-based interactions. This approach gives users the
opportunity to reflect on the AI-generated responses in a manner conducive to
creative thought.

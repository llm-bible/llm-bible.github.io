Machine translation (MT) models are known to suffer from gender bias especially when translating into languages with extensive gendered morphology. Accordingly they still fall short in using gender45;inclusive language also representative of non45;binary identities. In this paper we look at gender45;inclusive neomorphemes neologistic elements that avoid binary gender markings as an approach towards fairer MT. In this direction we explore prompting techniques with large language models (LLMs) to translate from English into Italian using neomorphemes. So far this area has been under45;explored due to its novelty and the lack of publicly available evaluation resources. We fill this gap by releasing Neo45;GATE a resource designed to evaluate gender45;inclusive en45;it translation with neomorphemes. With Neo45;GATE we assess four LLMs of different families and sizes and different prompt formats identifying strengths and weaknesses of each on this novel task for MT.

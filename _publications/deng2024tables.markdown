In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of various LLMs in interpreting tabular data through different prompting strategies and data formats. Our analyses extend across six benchmarks for table45;related tasks such as question45;answering and fact45;checking. We introduce for the first time the assessment of LLMs performance on image45;based table representations. Specifically we compare five text45;based and three image45;based table representations demonstrating the role of representation and prompting on LLM performance. Our study provides insights into the effective use of LLMs on table45;related tasks.

Learning effective fusion of multi45;modality features is at the heart of visual question answering. We propose a novel method of dynamically fusing multi45;modal features with intra45; and inter45;modality information flow which alternatively pass dynamic information between and across the visual and language modalities. It can robustly capture the high45;level interactions between language and vision domains thus significantly improves the performance of visual question answering. We also show that the proposed dynamic intra45;modality attention flow conditioned on the other modality can dynamically modulate the intra45;modality attention of the target modality which is vital for multimodality feature fusion. Experimental evaluations on the VQA 2.0 dataset show that the proposed method achieves state45;of45;the45;art VQA performance. Extensive ablation studies are carried out for the comprehensive analysis of the proposed method.

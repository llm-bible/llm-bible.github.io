Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT45;3 have emerged as general45;purpose language models capable of addressing many natural language generation or understanding tasks. On the task of Machine Translation (MT) multiple works have investigated few45;shot prompting mechanisms to elicit better translations from LLMs. However there has been relatively little investigation on how such translations differ qualitatively from the translations generated by standard Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models. In this work we investigate these differences in terms of the literalness of translations produced by the two systems. Using literalness measures involving word alignment and monotonicity we find that translations out of English (E45;X) from GPTs tend to be less literal while exhibiting similar or better scores on MT quality metrics. We demonstrate that this finding is borne out in human evaluations as well. We then show that these differences are especially pronounced when translating sentences that contain idiomatic expressions.

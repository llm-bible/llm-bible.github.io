This study explores how the Large Language Models (LLMs) adjust linguistic
features to create personalized persuasive outputs. While research showed that
LLMs personalize outputs, a gap remains in understanding the linguistic
features of their persuasive capabilities. We identified 13 linguistic features
crucial for influencing personalities across different levels of the Big Five
model of personality. We analyzed how prompts with personality trait
information influenced the output of 19 LLMs across five model families. The
findings show that models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism,
increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer
cognitive processes words for openness to experience. Some model families excel
at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness,
while only one model adapts language for neuroticism. Our findings show how
LLMs tailor responses based on personality cues in prompts, indicating their
potential to create persuasive content affecting the mind and well-being of the
recipients.

We present an open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (NMT). The new toolkit is mainly based on vaulted Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) along with many other improvements detailed below in order to create a self-contained simple to use consistent and comprehensive framework for Machine Translation tasks of various domains. It is tooled to support both bilingual and multilingual translation tasks starting from building the model from respective corpora to inferring new predictions or packaging the model to serving-capable JIT format.

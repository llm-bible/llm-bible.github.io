In this paper we propose an interactive matching network (IMN) for the multi45;turn response selection task. First IMN constructs word representations from three aspects to address the challenge of out45;of45;vocabulary (OOV) words. Second an attentive hierarchical recurrent encoder (AHRE) which is capable of encoding sentences hierarchically and generating more descriptive representations by aggregating with an attention mechanism is designed. Finally the bidirectional interactions between whole multi45;turn contexts and response candidates are calculated to derive the matching information between them. Experiments on four public datasets show that IMN outperforms the baseline models on all metrics achieving a new state45;of45;the45;art performance and demonstrating compatibility across domains for multi45;turn response selection.

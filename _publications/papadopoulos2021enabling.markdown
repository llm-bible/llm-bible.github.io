In this paper we present our submission for the EACL 2021 SRW; a methodology that aims at bridging the gap between high and low-resource languages in the context of Open Information Extraction showcasing it on the Greek language. The goals of this paper are twofold First we build Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models for English-to-Greek and Greek-to-English based on the Transformer architecture. Second we leverage these NMT models to produce English translations of Greek text as input for our NLP pipeline to which we apply a series of pre-processing and triple extraction tasks. Finally we back-translate the extracted triples to Greek. We conduct an evaluation of both our NMT and OIE methods on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art for the Greek natural language.

Web agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in planning and executing multi45;step interactions within complex web45;based environments fulfilling a wide range of web navigation tasks. Despite these advancements the potential for LLM45;powered agents to effectively engage with sequential user instructions in real45;world scenarios has not been fully explored. In this work we introduce a new task of Conversational Web Navigation which necessitates sophisticated interactions that span multiple turns with both the users and the environment supported by a specially developed dataset named Multi45;Turn Mind2Web (MT45;Mind2Web). To tackle the limited context length of LLMs and the context45;dependency issue of the conversational tasks we further propose a novel framework named self45;reflective memory45;augmented planning (Self45;MAP) which employs memory utilization and self45;reflection techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark the MT45;Mind2Web dataset and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

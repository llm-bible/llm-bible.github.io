We introduce Lemur and Lemur45;Chat openly accessible language models optimized for both natural language and coding capabilities to serve as the backbone of versatile language agents. The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction reasoning and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur45;Chat are proposed to address this necessity demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains unlike existing open45;source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pre45;training using a code45;intensive corpus and instruction fine45;tuning on text and code data our models achieve state45;of45;the45;art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks among open45;source models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemurs superiority over existing open45;source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication tool usage and interaction under fully45; and partially45; observable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur45;Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities providing key insights into developing advanced open45;source agents adept at reasoning planning and operating seamlessly across environments. https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur

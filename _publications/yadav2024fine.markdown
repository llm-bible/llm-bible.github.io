Improving mental health support in developing countries is a pressing need. One potential solution is the development of scalable automated systems to conduct diagnostic screenings which could help alleviate the burden on mental health professionals. In this work we evaluate several state45;of45;the45;art Large Language Models (LLMs) with and without fine45;tuning on our custom dataset for generating concise summaries from mental state examinations. We rigorously evaluate four different models for summary generation using established ROUGE metrics and input from human evaluators. The results highlight that our top45;performing fine45;tuned model outperforms existing models achieving ROUGE45;1 and ROUGE45;L values of 0.810 and 0.764 respectively. Furthermore we assessed the fine45;tuned models generalizability on a publicly available D4 dataset and the outcomes were promising indicating its potential applicability beyond our custom dataset.

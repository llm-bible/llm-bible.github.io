Recent studies have integrated large language models (LLMs) into diverse educational contexts including providing adaptive programming hints a type of feedback focuses on helping students move forward during problem45;solving. However most existing LLM45;based hint systems are limited to one single hint type. To investigate whether and how different levels of hints can support students problem45;solving and learning we conducted a think45;aloud study with 12 novices using the LLM Hint Factory a system providing four levels of hints from general natural language guidance to concrete code assistance varying in format and granularity. We discovered that high45;level natural language hints alone can be helpless or even misleading especially when addressing next45;step or syntax45;related help requests. Adding lower45;level hints like code examples with in45;line comments can better support students. The findings open up future work on customizing help responses from content format and granularity levels to accurately identify and meet students learning needs.

Recent studies have integrated large language models (LLMs) into diverse
educational contexts, including providing adaptive programming hints, a type of
feedback focuses on helping students move forward during problem-solving.
However, most existing LLM-based hint systems are limited to one single hint
type. To investigate whether and how different levels of hints can support
students' problem-solving and learning, we conducted a think-aloud study with
12 novices using the LLM Hint Factory, a system providing four levels of hints
from general natural language guidance to concrete code assistance, varying in
format and granularity. We discovered that high-level natural language hints
alone can be helpless or even misleading, especially when addressing next-step
or syntax-related help requests. Adding lower-level hints, like code examples
with in-line comments, can better support students. The findings open up future
work on customizing help responses from content, format, and granularity levels
to accurately identify and meet students' learning needs.

In this work we explore utilizing LLMs for data augmentation for
manufacturing task guidance system. The dataset consists of representative
samples of interactions with technicians working in an advanced manufacturing
setting. The purpose of this work to explore the task, data augmentation for
the supported tasks and evaluating the performance of the existing LLMs. We
observe that that task is complex requiring understanding from procedure
specification documents, actions and objects sequenced temporally. The dataset
consists of 200,000+ question/answer pairs that refer to the spec document and
are grounded in narrations and/or video demonstrations. We compared the
performance of several popular open-sourced LLMs by developing a baseline using
each LLM and then compared the responses in a reference-free setting using
LLM-as-a-judge and compared the ratings with crowd-workers whilst validating
the ratings with experts.

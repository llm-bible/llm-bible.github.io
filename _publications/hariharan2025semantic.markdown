Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved their capability in
performing NLP tasks. However, deeper semantic understanding, contextual
coherence, and more subtle reasoning are still difficult to obtain. The paper
discusses state-of-the-art methodologies that advance LLMs with more advanced
NLU techniques, such as semantic parsing, knowledge integration, and contextual
reinforcement learning. We analyze the use of structured knowledge graphs,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and fine-tuning strategies that match
models with human-level understanding. Furthermore, we address the
incorporation of transformer-based architectures, contrastive learning, and
hybrid symbolic-neural methods that address problems like hallucinations,
ambiguity, and inconsistency in the factual perspectives involved in performing
complex NLP tasks, such as question-answering text summarization and dialogue
generation. Our findings show the importance of semantic precision for
enhancing AI-driven language systems and suggest future research directions to
bridge the gap between statistical language models and true natural language
understanding.

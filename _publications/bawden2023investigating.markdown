The NLP community recently saw the release of a new large open45;access multilingual language model BLOOM (BigScience et al. 2022) covering 46 languages. We focus on BLOOMs multilingual ability by evaluating its machine translation performance across several datasets (WMT Flores45;101 and DiaBLa) and language pairs (high45; and low45;resourced). Our results show that 045;shot performance suffers from overgeneration and generating in the wrong language but this is greatly improved in the few45;shot setting with very good results for a number of language pairs. We study several aspects including prompt design model sizes cross45;lingual transfer and the use of discursive context.

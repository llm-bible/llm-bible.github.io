Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in multi-hop question-answering
(M-QA) due to their advanced reasoning abilities. However, the impact of the
inherent reasoning structures on LLM M-QA performance remains unclear, largely
due to the absence of QA datasets that provide fine-grained reasoning
structures. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Reasoning-Structured
Question Answering Dataset (GRS-QA), which includes both semantic contexts and
reasoning structures for QA pairs. Unlike existing M-QA datasets, where
different reasoning structures are entangled together, GRS-QA explicitly
captures intricate reasoning pathways by constructing reasoning graphs, where
nodes represent textual contexts and edges denote logical flows. These
reasoning graphs of different structures enable a fine-grained evaluation of
LLM reasoning capabilities across various reasoning structures. Our empirical
analysis reveals that LLMs perform differently when handling questions with
varying reasoning structures. This finding facilitates the exploration of
textual structures as compared with semantics.

Grading short answer questions automatically with interpretable reasoning behind the grading decision is a challenging goal for current transformer approaches. Justification cue detection in combination with logical reasoners has shown a promising direction for neuro45;symbolic architectures in ASAG. But one of the main challenges is the requirement of annotated justification cues in the students responses which only exist for a few ASAG datasets. To overcome this challenge we contribute (1) a weakly supervised annotation procedure for justification cues in ASAG datasets and (2) a neuro45;symbolic model for explainable ASAG based on justification cues. Our approach improves upon the RMSE by 0.24 to 0.3 compared to the state45;of45;the45;art on the Short Answer Feedback dataset in a bilingual multi45;domain and multi45;question training setup. This result shows that our approach provides a promising direction for generating high45;quality grades and accompanying explanations for future research in ASAG and educational NLP.

Modern natural language generation systems with Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit the capability to generate a plausible summary of multiple documents; however it is uncertain if they truly possess the capability of information consolidation to generate summaries especially on documents with opinionated information. We focus on meta45;review generation a form of sentiment summarisation for the scientific domain. To make scientific sentiment summarization more grounded we hypothesize that human meta45;reviewers follow a three45;layer framework of sentiment consolidation to write meta45;reviews. Based on the framework we propose novel prompting methods for LLMs to generate meta45;reviews and evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated meta45;reviews. Our framework is validated empirically as we find that prompting LLMs based on the framework 45;45; compared with prompting them with simple instructions 45;45; generates better meta45;reviews.

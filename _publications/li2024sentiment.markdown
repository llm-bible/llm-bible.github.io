Modern natural language generation systems with Large Language Models (LLMs)
exhibit the capability to generate a plausible summary of multiple documents;
however, it is uncertain if they truly possess the capability of information
consolidation to generate summaries, especially on documents with opinionated
information. We focus on meta-review generation, a form of sentiment
summarisation for the scientific domain. To make scientific sentiment
summarization more grounded, we hypothesize that human meta-reviewers follow a
three-layer framework of sentiment consolidation to write meta-reviews. Based
on the framework, we propose novel prompting methods for LLMs to generate
meta-reviews and evaluation metrics to assess the quality of generated
meta-reviews. Our framework is validated empirically as we find that prompting
LLMs based on the framework -- compared with prompting them with simple
instructions -- generates better meta-reviews.

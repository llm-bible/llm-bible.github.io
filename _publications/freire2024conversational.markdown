Conversational Assistants (CA) are increasingly supporting human workers in knowledge management. Traditionally CAs respond in specific ways to predefined user intents and conversation patterns. However this rigidness does not handle the diversity of natural language well. Recent advances in natural language processing namely Large Language Models (LLMs) enable CAs to converse in a more flexible human45;like manner extracting relevant information from texts and capturing information from expert humans but introducing new challenges such as hallucinations. To assess the potential of using LLMs for knowledge management tasks we conducted a user study comparing an LLM45;based CA to an intent45;based system regarding interaction efficiency user experience workload and usability. This revealed that LLM45;based CAs exhibited better user experience task completion rate usability and perceived performance than intent45;based systems suggesting that switching NLP techniques can be beneficial in the context of knowledge management.

Safety45;aligned large language models (LLMs) sometimes falsely refuse pseudo45;harmful prompts like how to kill a mosquito which are actually harmless. Frequent false refusals not only frustrate users but also provoke a public backlash against the very values alignment seeks to protect. In this paper we propose the first method to auto45;generate diverse content45;controlled and model45;dependent pseudo45;harmful prompts. Using this method we construct an evaluation dataset called PHTest which is ten times larger than existing datasets covers more false refusal patterns and separately labels controversial prompts. We evaluate 20 LLMs on PHTest uncovering new insights due to its scale and labeling. Our findings reveal a trade45;off between minimizing false refusals and improving safety against jailbreak attacks. Moreover we show that many jailbreak defenses significantly increase the false refusal rates thereby undermining usability. Our method and dataset can help developers evaluate and fine45;tune safer and more usable LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/umd&#45;huang&#45;lab/FalseRefusal

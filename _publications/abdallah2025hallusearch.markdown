In this paper, we present HalluSearch, a multilingual pipeline designed to
detect fabricated text spans in Large Language Model (LLM) outputs. Developed
as part of Mu-SHROOM, the Multilingual Shared-task on Hallucinations and
Related Observable Overgeneration Mistakes, HalluSearch couples
retrieval-augmented verification with fine-grained factual splitting to
identify and localize hallucinations in fourteen different languages. Empirical
evaluations show that HalluSearch performs competitively, placing fourth in
both English (within the top ten percent) and Czech. While the system's
retrieval-based strategy generally proves robust, it faces challenges in
languages with limited online coverage, underscoring the need for further
research to ensure consistent hallucination detection across diverse linguistic
contexts.

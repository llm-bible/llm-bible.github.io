Electronic Health Record (EHR) tables pose unique challenges among which is
the presence of hidden contextual dependencies between medical features with a
high level of data dimensionality and sparsity. This study presents the first
investigation into the abilities of LLMs to comprehend EHRs for patient data
extraction and retrieval. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMICSQL
dataset to explore the impact of the prompt structure, instruction, context,
and demonstration, of two backbone LLMs, Llama2 and Meditron, based on task
performance. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, our findings show
that optimal feature selection and serialization methods can enhance task
performance by up to 26.79% compared to naive approaches. Similarly, in-context
learning setups with relevant example selection improve data extraction
performance by 5.95%. Based on our study findings, we propose guidelines that
we believe would help the design of LLM-based models to support health search.

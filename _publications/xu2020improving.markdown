Fine45;tuning pre45;trained language models like BERT has become an effective way in NLP and yields state45;of45;the45;art results on many downstream tasks. Recent studies on adapting BERT to new tasks mainly focus on modifying the model structure re45;designing the pre45;train tasks and leveraging external data and knowledge. The fine45;tuning strategy itself has yet to be fully explored. In this paper we improve the fine45;tuning of BERT with two effective mechanisms self45;ensemble and self45;distillation. The experiments on text classification and natural language inference tasks show our proposed methods can significantly improve the adaption of BERT without any external data or knowledge.

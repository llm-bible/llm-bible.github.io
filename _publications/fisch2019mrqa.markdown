We present the results of the Machine Reading for Question Answering (MRQA) 2019 shared task on evaluating the generalization capabilities of reading comprehension systems. In this task we adapted and unified 18 distinct question answering datasets into the same format. Among them six datasets were made available for training six datasets were made available for development and the final six were hidden for final evaluation. Ten teams submitted systems which explored various ideas including data sampling multi-task learning adversarial training and ensembling. The best system achieved an average F1 score of 72.5 on the 12 held-out datasets 10.7 absolute points higher than our initial baseline based on BERT.

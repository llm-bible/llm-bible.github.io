This study investigates the transformative potential of Large Language Models
(LLMs), such as OpenAI ChatGPT, in medical imaging. With the aid of public
data, these models, which possess remarkable language understanding and
generation capabilities, are augmenting the interpretive skills of
radiologists, enhancing patient-physician communication, and streamlining
clinical workflows. The paper introduces an analytic framework for presenting
the complex interactions between LLMs and the broader ecosystem of medical
imaging stakeholders, including businesses, insurance entities, governments,
research institutions, and hospitals (nicknamed BIGR-H). Through detailed
analyses, illustrative use cases, and discussions on the broader implications
and future directions, this perspective seeks to raise discussion in strategic
planning and decision-making in the era of AI-enabled healthcare.

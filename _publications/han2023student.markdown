The integration of generative AI in education is expanding yet empirical analyses of large45;scale real45;world interactions between students and AI systems still remain limited. In this study we present ChEDDAR ChatGPT amp; EFL Learners Dialogue Dataset As Revising an essay which is collected from a semester45;long longitudinal experiment involving 212 college students enrolled in English as Foreign Langauge (EFL) writing courses. The students were asked to revise their essays through dialogues with ChatGPT. ChEDDAR includes a conversation log utterance45;level essay edit history self45;rated satisfaction and students intent in addition to session45;level pre45;and45;post surveys documenting their objectives and overall experiences. We analyze students usage patterns and perceptions regarding generative AI with respect to their intent and satisfaction. As a foundational step we establish baseline results for two pivotal tasks in task45;oriented dialogue systems within educational contexts intent detection and satisfaction estimation. We finally suggest further research to refine the integration of generative AI into education settings outlining potential scenarios utilizing ChEDDAR. ChEDDAR is publicly available at https://github.com/zeunie/ChEDDAR.

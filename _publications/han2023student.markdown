The integration of generative AI in education is expanding, yet empirical
analyses of large-scale, real-world interactions between students and AI
systems still remain limited. In this study, we present ChEDDAR, ChatGPT & EFL
Learner's Dialogue Dataset As Revising an essay, which is collected from a
semester-long longitudinal experiment involving 212 college students enrolled
in English as Foreign Langauge (EFL) writing courses. The students were asked
to revise their essays through dialogues with ChatGPT. ChEDDAR includes a
conversation log, utterance-level essay edit history, self-rated satisfaction,
and students' intent, in addition to session-level pre-and-post surveys
documenting their objectives and overall experiences. We analyze students'
usage patterns and perceptions regarding generative AI with respect to their
intent and satisfaction. As a foundational step, we establish baseline results
for two pivotal tasks in task-oriented dialogue systems within educational
contexts: intent detection and satisfaction estimation. We finally suggest
further research to refine the integration of generative AI into education
settings, outlining potential scenarios utilizing ChEDDAR. ChEDDAR is publicly
available at https://github.com/zeunie/ChEDDAR.

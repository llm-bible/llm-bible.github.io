We present AI-VERDE, a unified LLM-as-a-platform service designed to
facilitate seamless integration of commercial, cloud-hosted, and on-premise
open LLMs in academic settings. AI-VERDE streamlines access management for
instructional and research groups by providing features such as robust access
control, privacy-preserving mechanisms, native Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) support, budget management for third-party LLM services, and both a
conversational web interface and API access. In a pilot deployment at a large
public university, AI-VERDE demonstrated significant engagement across diverse
educational and research groups, enabling activities that would typically
require substantial budgets for commercial LLM services with limited user and
team management capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, AI-Verde is the
first platform to address both academic and research needs for LLMs within an
higher education institutional framework.

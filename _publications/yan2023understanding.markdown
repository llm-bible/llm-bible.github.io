This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in45;context learning in Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work provides a novel perspective by examining in45;context learning via the lens of surface repetitions. We quantitatively investigate the role of surface features in text generation and empirically establish the existence of emph123;token co45;occurrence reinforcement125; a principle that strengthens the relationship between two tokens based on their contextual co45;occurrences. By investigating the dual impacts of these features our research illuminates the internal workings of in45;context learning and expounds on the reasons for its failures. This paper provides an essential contribution to the understanding of in45;context learning and its potential limitations providing a fresh perspective on this exciting capability.

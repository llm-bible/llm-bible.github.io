This paper explores the elusive mechanism underpinning in-context learning in
Large Language Models (LLMs). Our work provides a novel perspective by
examining in-context learning via the lens of surface repetitions. We
quantitatively investigate the role of surface features in text generation, and
empirically establish the existence of *token co-occurrence
reinforcement*, a principle that strengthens the relationship between two
tokens based on their contextual co-occurrences. By investigating the dual
impacts of these features, our research illuminates the internal workings of
in-context learning and expounds on the reasons for its failures. This paper
provides an essential contribution to the understanding of in-context learning
and its potential limitations, providing a fresh perspective on this exciting
capability.

Multilingualism in Large Language Models (LLMs) is an yet under-explored area. In this paper we conduct an in-depth analysis of the multilingual capabilities of a family of a Large Language Model examining its architecture activation patterns and processing mechanisms across languages. We introduce novel metrics to probe the models multilingual behaviour at different layers and shed light on the impact of architectural choices on multilingual processing. Our findings reveal different patterns of multilinugal processing in the sublayers of Feed-Forward Networks of the models. Furthermore we uncover the phenomenon of over-layerization in certain model configurations where increasing layer depth without corresponding adjustments to other parameters may degrade model performance. Through comparisons within and across languages we demonstrate the interplay between model architecture layer depth and multilingual processing capabilities of LLMs trained on multiple languages.

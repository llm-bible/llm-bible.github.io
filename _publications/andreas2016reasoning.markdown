We present a model for pragmatically describing scenes, in which contrastive
behavior results from a combination of inference-driven pragmatics and learned
semantics. Like previous learned approaches to language generation, our model
uses a simple feature-driven architecture (here a pair of neural "listener" and
"speaker" models) to ground language in the world. Like inference-driven
approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior
when selecting utterances. For training, our approach requires only ordinary
captions, annotated _without_ demonstration of the pragmatic behavior the model
ultimately exhibits. In human evaluations on a referring expression game, our
approach succeeds 81% of the time, compared to a 69% success rate using
existing techniques.

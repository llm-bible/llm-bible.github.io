We present a knowledge-grounded dialog system developed for the ninth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC9) Track 1 - Beyond Domain APIs Task-oriented Conversational Modeling with Unstructured Knowledge Access. We leverage transfer learning with existing language models to accomplish the tasks in this challenge track. Specifically we divided the task into four sub-tasks and fine-tuned several Transformer models on each of the sub-tasks. We made additional changes that yielded gains in both performance and efficiency including the combination of the model with traditional entity-matching techniques and the addition of a pointer network to the output layer of the language model.

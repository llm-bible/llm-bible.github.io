In the rapidly evolving landscape of online recipe sharing within a globalized context there has been a notable surge in research towards comprehending and generating food recipes. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) like GPT45;2 and LLaVA have paved the way for Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to delve deeper into various facets of food45;related tasks encompassing ingredient recognition and comprehensive recipe generation. Despite impressive performance and multi45;modal adaptability of LLMs domain45;specific training remains paramount for their effective application. This work evaluates existing LLMs for recipe generation and proposes LLaVA45;Chef a novel model trained on a curated dataset of diverse recipe prompts in a multi45;stage approach. First we refine the mapping of visual food image embeddings to the language space. Second we adapt LLaVA to the food domain by fine45;tuning it on relevant recipe data. Third we utilize diverse prompts to enhance the models recipe comprehension. Finally we improve the linguistic quality of generated recipes by penalizing the model with a custom loss function. LLaVA45;Chef demonstrates impressive improvements over pretrained LLMs and prior works. A detailed qualitative analysis reveals that LLaVA45;Chef generates more detailed recipes with precise ingredient mentions compared to existing approaches.

Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT45;4 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various generative tasks. However their performance is often hampered by limitations in accessing and leveraging long45;term memory leading to specific vulnerabilities and biases especially during long interactions. This paper introduces ChatLogic an innovative framework specifically targeted at LLM reasoning tasks that can enhance the performance of LLMs in multi45;step deductive reasoning tasks by integrating logic programming. In ChatLogic the language model plays a central role acting as a controller and participating in every system operation stage. We propose a novel method of converting logic problems into symbolic integration with an inference engine. This approach leverages large language models situational understanding and imitation skills and uses symbolic memory to enhance multi45;step deductive reasoning capabilities. Our results show that the ChatLogic framework significantly improves the multi45;step reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The source code and data are available at url123;https://github.com/Strong&#45;AI&#45;Lab/ChatLogic&#125;

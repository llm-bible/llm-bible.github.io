We present a simple sequential sentence encoder for multi45;domain natural language inference. Our encoder is based on stacked bidirectional LSTM45;RNNs with shortcut connections and fine45;tuning of word embeddings. The overall supervised model uses the above encoder to encode two input sentences into two vectors and then uses a classifier over the vector combination to label the relationship between these two sentences as that of entailment contradiction or neural. Our Shortcut45;Stacked sentence encoders achieve strong improvements over existing encoders on matched and mismatched multi45;domain natural language inference (top non45;ensemble single45;model result in the EMNLP RepEval 2017 Shared Task (Nangia et al. 2017)). Moreover they achieve the new state45;of45;the45;art encoding result on the original SNLI dataset (Bowman et al. 2015).

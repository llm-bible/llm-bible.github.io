Efforts have been made to make machines converse like humans in the past few
decades. The recent techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs) make it possible
to have human-like conversations with machines, but LLM's flaws of lacking
understanding and reliability are well documented. We believe that the best way
to eliminate this problem is to use LLMs only as parsers to translate text to
knowledge and vice versa and carry out the conversation by reasoning over this
knowledge using the answer set programming. I have been developing a framework
based on LLMs and ASP to realize reliable chatbots that "understand" human
conversation. This framework has been used to develop task-specific chatbots as
well as socialbots. My future research is focused on making these chatbots
scalable and trainable.

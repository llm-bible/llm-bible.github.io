Recent advances in LLM-based role-playing language agents (RPLAs) have
attracted broad attention in various applications. While chain-of-thought
reasoning has shown importance in many tasks for LLMs, the internal thinking
processes of RPLAs remain unexplored. Understanding characters' inner thoughts
is crucial for developing advanced RPLAs. In this paper, we introduce
ROLETHINK, a novel benchmark constructed from literature for evaluating
character thought generation. We propose the task of inner thought reasoning,
which includes two sets: the gold set that compares generated thoughts with
original character monologues, and the silver set that uses expert synthesized
character analyses as references. To address this challenge, we propose MIRROR,
a chain-of-thought approach that generates character thoughts by retrieving
memories, predicting character reactions, and synthesizing motivations. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate the importance of inner thought reasoning
for RPLAs, and MIRROR consistently outperforms existing methods. Resources are

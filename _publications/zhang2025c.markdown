Despite the rapid advancement of large language models, they remain highly
susceptible to generating hallucinations, which significantly hinders their
widespread application. Hallucination research requires dynamic and
fine-grained evaluation. However, most existing hallucination benchmarks
(especially in Chinese language) rely on human annotations, making automatical
and cost-effective hallucination evaluation challenging. To address this, we
introduce HaluAgent, an agentic framework that automatically constructs
fine-grained QA dataset based on some knowledge documents. Our experiments
demonstrate that the manually designed rules and prompt optimization can
improve the quality of generated data. Using HaluAgent, we construct C-FAITH, a
Chinese QA hallucination benchmark created from 1,399 knowledge documents
obtained from web scraping, totaling 60,702 entries. We comprehensively
evaluate 16 mainstream LLMs with our proposed C-FAITH, providing detailed
experimental results and analysis.

Given the advancements in conversational artificial intelligence, the
evaluation and assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role
in ensuring optimal performance across various conversational tasks. In this
paper, we present a comprehensive study that thoroughly evaluates the
capabilities and limitations of five prevalent LLMs: Llama, OPT, Falcon,
Alpaca, and MPT. The study encompasses various conversational tasks, including
reservation, empathetic response generation, mental health and legal
counseling, persuasion, and negotiation. To conduct the evaluation, an
extensive test setup is employed, utilizing multiple evaluation criteria that
span from automatic to human evaluation. This includes using generic and
task-specific metrics to gauge the LMs' performance accurately. From our
evaluation, no single model emerges as universally optimal for all tasks.
Instead, their performance varies significantly depending on the specific
requirements of each task. While some models excel in certain tasks, they may
demonstrate comparatively poorer performance in others. These findings
emphasize the importance of considering task-specific requirements and
characteristics when selecting the most suitable LM for conversational
applications.

Recommender systems have become integral to our digital experiences from online shopping to streaming platforms. Still the rationale behind their suggestions often remains opaque to users. While some systems employ a graph-based approach offering inherent explainability through paths associating recommended items and seed items non-experts could not easily understand these explanations. A popular alternative is to convert graph-based explanations into textual ones using a template and an algorithm which we denote here as template-based explanations. Yet these can sometimes come across as impersonal or uninspiring. A novel method would be to employ large language models (LLMs) for this purpose which we denote as LLM-based. To assess the effectiveness of LLMs in generating more resonant explanations we conducted a pilot study with 25 participants. They were presented with three explanations (1) traditional template-based (2) LLM-based rephrasing of the template output and (3) purely LLM-based explanations derived from the graph-based explanations. Although subject to high variance preliminary findings suggest that LLM-based explanations may provide a richer and more engaging user experience further aligning with user expectations. This study sheds light on the potential limitations of current explanation methods and offers promising directions for leveraging large language models to improve user satisfaction and trust in recommender systems.

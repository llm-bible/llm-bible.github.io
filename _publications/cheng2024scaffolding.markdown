Programmers frequently engage with machine learning tutorials in
computational notebooks and have been adopting code generation technologies
based on large language models (LLMs). However, they encounter difficulties in
understanding and working with code produced by LLMs. To mitigate these
challenges, we introduce a novel workflow into computational notebooks that
augments LLM-based code generation with an additional ephemeral UI step,
offering users UI scaffolds as an intermediate stage between user prompts and
code generation. We present this workflow in BISCUIT, an extension for
JupyterLab that provides users with ephemeral UIs generated by LLMs based on
the context of their code and intentions, scaffolding users to understand,
guide, and explore with LLM-generated code. Through a user study where 10
novices used BISCUIT for machine learning tutorials, we found that BISCUIT
offers users representations of code to aid their understanding, reduces the
complexity of prompt engineering, and creates a playground for users to explore
different variables and iterate on their ideas.

Architects adopt visual scripting and parametric design tools to explore more
expansive design spaces (Coates, 2010), refine their thinking about the
geometric logic of their design (Woodbury, 2010), and overcome conventional
software limitations (Burry, 2011). Despite two decades of effort to make
design scripting more accessible, a disconnect between a designer's free ways
of thinking and the rigidity of algorithms remains (Burry, 2011). Recent
developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest this might soon change, as
LLMs encode a general understanding of human context and exhibit the capacity
to produce geometric logic. This project speculates that if LLMs can
effectively mediate between user intent and algorithms, they become a powerful
tool to make scripting in design more widespread and fun. We explore if such
systems can interpret natural language prompts to assemble geometric operations
relevant to computational design scripting. In the system, multiple layers of
LLM agents are configured with specific context to infer the user intent and
construct a sequential logic. Given a user's high-level text prompt, a
geometric description is created, distilled into a sequence of logic
operations, and mapped to software-specific commands. The completed script is
constructed in the user's visual programming interface. The system succeeds in
generating complete visual scripts up to a certain complexity but fails beyond
this complexity threshold. It shows how LLMs can make design scripting much
more aligned with human creativity and thought. Future research should explore
conversational interactions, expand to multimodal inputs and outputs, and
assess the performance of these tools.

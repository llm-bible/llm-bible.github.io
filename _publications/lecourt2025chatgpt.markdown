This work investigates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
detecting and understanding human emotions through text. Drawing upon emotion
models from psychology, we adopt an interdisciplinary perspective that
integrates computational and affective sciences insights. The main goal is to
assess how accurately they can identify emotions expressed in textual
interactions and compare different models on this specific task. This research
contributes to broader efforts to enhance human-computer interaction, making
artificial intelligence technologies more responsive and sensitive to users'
emotional nuances. By employing a methodology that involves comparisons with a
state-of-the-art model on the GoEmotions dataset, we aim to gauge LLMs'
effectiveness as a system for emotional analysis, paving the way for potential
applications in various fields that require a nuanced understanding of human
language.

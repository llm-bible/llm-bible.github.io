Retrieval45;augmented language models have exhibited promising performance across various areas of natural language processing (NLP) including fact45;critical tasks. However due to the black45;box nature of advanced large language models (LLMs) and the non45;retrieval45;oriented supervision signal of specific tasks the training of retrieval model faces significant challenges under the setting of black45;box LLM. We propose an approach leveraging Fine45;grained Feedback with Reinforcement Retrieval (FFRR) to enhance fact45;checking on news claims by using black45;box LLM. FFRR adopts a two45;level strategy to gather fine45;grained feedback from the LLM which serves as a reward for optimizing the retrieval policy by rating the retrieved documents based on the non45;retrieval ground truth of the task. We evaluate our model on two public datasets for real45;world news claim verification and the results demonstrate that FFRR achieves significant improvements over strong LLM45;enabled and non45;LLM baselines.

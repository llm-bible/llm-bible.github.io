Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked wide interest in validating and comprehending the human-like cognitive-behavioral traits LLMs may have. These cognitive-behavioral traits include typically Attitudes Opinions Values (AOV). However measuring AOV embedded within LLMs remains opaque and different evaluation methods may yield different results. This has led to a lack of clarity on how different studies are related to each other and how they can be interpreted. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing an overview of recent works on the evaluation of AOV in LLMs. Moreover we survey related approaches in different stages of the evaluation pipeline in these works. By doing so we address the potential and challenges with respect to understanding the model human-AI alignment and downstream application in social sciences. Finally we provide practical insights into evaluation methods model enhancement and interdisciplinary collaboration thereby contributing to the evolving landscape of evaluating AOV in LLMs.

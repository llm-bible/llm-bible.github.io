Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked wide interest in
validating and comprehending the human-like cognitive-behavioral traits LLMs
may capture and convey. These cognitive-behavioral traits include typically
Attitudes, Opinions, Values (AOVs). However, measuring AOVs embedded within
LLMs remains opaque, and different evaluation methods may yield different
results. This has led to a lack of clarity on how different studies are related
to each other and how they can be interpreted. This paper aims to bridge this
gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent works on the evaluation of
AOVs in LLMs. Moreover, we survey related approaches in different stages of the
evaluation pipeline in these works. By doing so, we address the potential and
challenges with respect to understanding the model, human-AI alignment, and
downstream application in social sciences. Finally, we provide practical
insights into evaluation methods, model enhancement, and interdisciplinary
collaboration, thereby contributing to the evolving landscape of evaluating
AOVs in LLMs.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but their
English-centric training data limits performance in non-English languages,
highlighting the need for enhancements in their multilingual capabilities.
While some work on multilingual prompting methods handles non-English queries
by utilizing English translations or restructuring them to more closely align
with LLM reasoning patterns, these works often overlook the importance of
cultural context, limiting their effectiveness. To address this limitation, we
propose EMCEI, a simple yet effective approach that improves LLMs' multilingual
capabilities by incorporating cultural context for more accurate and
appropriate responses. Specifically, EMCEI follows a two-step process that
first extracts relevant cultural context from the LLM's parametric knowledge
via prompting. Then, EMCEI employs an LLM-as-Judge mechanism to select the most
appropriate response by balancing cultural relevance and reasoning ability.
Experiments on diverse multilingual benchmarks show that EMCEI outperforms
existing baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling multilingual
queries with LLMs.

Large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a wide variety of rhetorical
styles and generate text that expresses a broad spectrum of sentiments. This
capacity, now available at low cost, makes them powerful tools for manipulation
and control. In this paper, we consider a set of underestimated societal harms
made possible by the rapid and largely unregulated adoption of LLMs. Rather
than consider LLMs as isolated digital artefacts used to displace this or that
area of work, we focus on the large-scale computational infrastructure upon
which they are instrumentalised across domains. We begin with discussion on how
LLMs may be used to both pollute and uniformize information environments and
how these modalities may be leveraged as mechanisms of control. We then draw
attention to several areas of emerging research, each of which compounds the
capabilities of LLMs as instruments of power. These include (i) persuasion
through the real-time design of choice architectures in conversational
interfaces (e.g., via "AI personas"), (ii) the use of LLM-agents as
computational models of human agents (e.g., "silicon subjects"), (iii) the use
of LLM-agents as computational models of human agent populations (e.g.,
"silicon societies") and finally, (iv) the combination of LLMs with
reinforcement learning to produce controllable and steerable strategic dialogue
models. We draw these strands together to discuss how these areas may be
combined to build LLM-based systems that serve as powerful instruments of
individual, social and political control via the simulation and disingenuous
"prediction" of human behaviour, intent, and action.

Hallucinations pose a significant challenge to the reliability and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) limiting their widespread acceptance beyond chatbot applications. Despite ongoing efforts hallucinations remain a prevalent challenge in LLMs. The detection of hallucinations itself is also a formidable task frequently requiring manual labeling or constrained evaluations. This paper introduces an automated scalable framework that combines benchmarking LLMs hallucination tendencies with efficient hallucination detection. We leverage LLMs to generate challenging tasks related to hypothetical phenomena subsequently employing them as agents for efficient hallucination detection. The framework is domain-agnostic allowing the use of any language model for benchmark creation or evaluation in any domain. We introduce the publicly available HypoTermQA Benchmarking Dataset on which state-of-the-art models performance ranged between 3 and 11 and evaluator agents demonstrated a 6 error rate in hallucination prediction. The proposed framework provides opportunities to test and improve LLMs. Additionally it has the potential to generate benchmarking datasets tailored to specific domains such as law health and finance.

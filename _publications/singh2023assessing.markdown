Multi-modality promises to unlock further uses for large language models.
Recently, the state-of-the-art language model GPT-4 was enhanced with vision
capabilities. We carry out a prompting evaluation of GPT-4V and five other
baselines on structured reasoning tasks, such as mathematical reasoning, visual
data analysis, and code generation. We show that visual Chain-of-Thought, an
extension of Chain-of-Thought to multi-modal LLMs, yields significant
improvements over the vanilla model. We also present a categorized analysis of
scenarios where these models perform well and where they struggle, highlighting
challenges associated with coherent multimodal reasoning.

Multi45;modality promises to unlock further uses for large language models. Recently the state45;of45;the45;art language model GPT45;4 was enhanced with vision capabilities. We carry out a prompting evaluation of GPT45;4V and five other baselines on structured reasoning tasks such as mathematical reasoning visual data analysis and code generation. We show that visual Chain45;of45;Thought an extension of Chain45;of45;Thought to multi45;modal LLMs yields significant improvements over the vanilla model. We also present a categorized analysis of scenarios where these models perform well and where they struggle highlighting challenges associated with coherent multimodal reasoning.

Instruction tuning aligns the response of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Despite such efforts in human45;45;LLM alignment we find that instruction tuning does not always make LLMs human45;like from a cognitive modeling perspective. More specifically next45;word probabilities estimated by instruction45;tuned LLMs are often worse at simulating human reading behavior than those estimated by base LLMs. In addition we explore prompting methodologies for simulating human reading behavior with LLMs. Our results show that prompts reflecting a particular linguistic hypothesis improve psychometric predictive power but are still inferior to small base models. These findings highlight that recent advancements in LLMs i.e. instruction tuning and prompting do not offer better estimates than direct probability measurements from base LLMs in cognitive modeling. In other words pure next45;word probability remains a strong predictor for human reading behavior even in the age of LLMs.

This work investigates a challenging task named open45;domain interleaved image45;text generation which generates interleaved texts and images following an input query. We propose a new interleaved generation framework based on prompting large45;language models (LLMs) and pre45;trained text45;to45;image (T2I) models namely OpenLEAF. In OpenLEAF the LLM generates textual descriptions coordinates T2I models creates visual prompts for generating images and incorporates global contexts into the T2I models. This global context improves the entity and style consistencies of images in the interleaved generation. For model assessment we first propose to use large multi45;modal models (LMMs) to evaluate the entity and style consistencies of open45;domain interleaved image45;text sequences. According to the LMM evaluation on our constructed evaluation set the proposed interleaved generation framework can generate high45;quality image45;text content for various domains and applications such as how45;to question answering storytelling graphical story rewriting and webpage/poster generation tasks. Moreover we validate the effectiveness of the proposed LMM evaluation technique with human assessment. We hope our proposed framework benchmark and LMM evaluation could help establish the intriguing interleaved image45;text generation task.

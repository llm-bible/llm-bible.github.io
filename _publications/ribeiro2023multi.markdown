We introduce STREET a unified multi45;task and multi45;domain natural language reasoning and explanation benchmark. Unlike most existing question45;answering (QA) datasets we expect models to not only answer questions but also produce step45;by45;step structured explanations describing how premises in the question are used to produce intermediate conclusions that can prove the correctness of a certain answer. We perform extensive evaluation with popular language models such as few45;shot prompting GPT45;3 and fine45;tuned T5. We find that these models still lag behind human performance when producing such structured reasoning steps. We believe this work will provide a way for the community to better train and test systems on multi45;step reasoning and explanations in natural language.

We introduce STREET, a unified multi-task and multi-domain natural language
reasoning and explanation benchmark. Unlike most existing question-answering
(QA) datasets, we expect models to not only answer questions, but also produce
step-by-step structured explanations describing how premises in the question
are used to produce intermediate conclusions that can prove the correctness of
a certain answer. We perform extensive evaluation with popular language models
such as few-shot prompting GPT-3 and fine-tuned T5. We find that these models
still lag behind human performance when producing such structured reasoning
steps. We believe this work will provide a way for the community to better
train and test systems on multi-step reasoning and explanations in natural
language.

ChatGPTa cutting45;edge AI45;powered Chatbotcan quickly generate responses on given commands. While it was reported that ChatGPT had the capacity to deliver useful feedback it is still unclear about its effectiveness compared with conventional feedback approachessuch as teacher feedback (TF) and self45;feedback (SF). To address this issue this study compared the revised Chinese to English translation texts produced by Chinese Master of Translation and Interpretation (MTI) studentswho learned English as a Second/Foreign Language (ESL/EFL) based on three feedback types (i.e. ChatGPT45;based feedback TF and SF). The data was analyzed using BLEU score to gauge the overall translation quality as well as Coh45;Metrix to examine linguistic features across three dimensions lexicon syntax and cohesion.The findings revealed that TF45; and SF45;guided translation texts surpassed those with ChatGPT45;based feedback as indicated by the BLEU score. In terms of linguistic featuresChatGPT45;based feedback demonstrated superiority particularly in enhancing lexical capability and referential cohesion in the translation texts. However TF and SF proved more effective in developing syntax45;related skillsas it addressed instances of incorrect usage of the passive voice. These diverse outcomes indicate ChatGPTs potential as a supplementary resource complementing traditional teacher45;led methods in translation practice.

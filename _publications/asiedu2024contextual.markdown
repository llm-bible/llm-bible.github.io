While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for medical question
answering, there is limited work focused on tropical and infectious
disease-specific exploration. We build on an opensource tropical and infectious
diseases (TRINDs) dataset, expanding it to include demographic and semantic
clinical and consumer augmentations yielding 11000+ prompts. We evaluate LLM
performance on these, comparing generalist and medical LLMs, as well as LLM
outcomes to human experts. We demonstrate through systematic experimentation,
the benefit of contextual information such as demographics, location, gender,
risk factors for optimal LLM response. Finally we develop a prototype of
TRINDs-LM, a research tool that provides a playground to navigate how context
impacts LLM outputs for health.

Recent advancements in large language models have revolutionized information
access, as these models harness data available on the web to address complex
queries, becoming the preferred information source for many users. In certain
cases, queries are about publicly available data, which can be effectively
answered with data visualizations. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
large language models to provide accurate data and relevant visualizations in
response to such queries. Specifically, we investigate the ability of GPT-3 and
GPT-4 to generate visualizations with dataless prompts, where no data
accompanies the query. We evaluate the results of the models by comparing them
to visualization cheat sheets created by visualization experts.

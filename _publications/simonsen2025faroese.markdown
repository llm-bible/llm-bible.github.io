We present FoQA, a Faroese extractive question-answering (QA) dataset with
2,000 samples, created using a semi-automated approach combining Large Language
Models (LLMs) and human validation. The dataset was generated from Faroese
Wikipedia articles using GPT-4-turbo for initial QA generation, followed by
question rephrasing to increase complexity and native speaker validation to
ensure quality. We provide baseline performance metrics for FoQA across
multiple models, including LLMs and BERT, demonstrating its effectiveness in
evaluating Faroese QA performance. The dataset is released in three versions: a
validated set of 2,000 samples, a complete set of all 10,001 generated samples,
and a set of 2,395 rejected samples for error analysis.

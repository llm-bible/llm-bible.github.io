In recent times large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance on various document45;level tasks such as document classification summarization and question45;answering. However research on understanding their capabilities on the task of self45;contradictions in long documents has been very limited. In this work we introduce ContraDoc the first human45;annotated dataset to study self45;contradictions in long documents across multiple domains varying document lengths self45;contradictions types and scope. We then analyze the current capabilities of four state45;of45;the45;art open45;source and commercially available LLMs GPT3.5 GPT4 PaLM2 and LLaMAv2 on this dataset. While GPT4 performs the best and can outperform humans on this task we find that it is still unreliable and struggles with self45;contradictions that require more nuance and context. We release the dataset and all the code associated with the experiments (https://github.com/ddhruvkr/CONTRADOC).

The primary limitation of large language models (LLMs) is their restricted understanding of the world. This poses significant difficulties for LLM-based agents particularly in domains where pre-trained LLMs lack sufficient knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel framework called AutoGuide that bridges the knowledge gap in pre-trained LLMs by leveraging implicit knowledge in offline experiences. Specifically AutoGuide effectively extracts knowledge embedded in offline data by extracting a set of state-aware guidelines. Importantly each state-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows a conditional structure clearly describing the state where it is applicable. As such the resulting guidelines enable a principled way to provide helpful knowledge pertinent to an agents current decision-making process. We show that our approach outperforms competitive LLM-based baselines by a large margin in sequential decision-making benchmarks.

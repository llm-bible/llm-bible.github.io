Automated long45;form story generation typically employs long45;context large language models (LLMs) for one45;shot creation which can produce cohesive but not necessarily engaging content. We introduce Storytelling With Action Guidance (SWAG) a novel approach to storytelling with LLMs. Our approach reduces story writing to a search problem through a two45;model feedback loop one LLM generates story content and another auxiliary LLM is used to choose the next best action to steer the storys future direction. Our results show that SWAG can substantially outperform previous end45;to45;end story generation techniques when evaluated by GPT45;4 and through human evaluation and our SWAG pipeline using only open45;source models surpasses GPT45;3.545;Turbo.

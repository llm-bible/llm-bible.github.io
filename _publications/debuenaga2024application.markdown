The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language models are an
artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology that enables
automatic text generation. There is a growing interest in applying GPT language
models to university teaching in various dimensions. From the perspective of
innovation in student and teacher activities, they can provide support in
understanding and generating content, problem-solving, as well as
personalization and test correction, among others. From the dimension of
internationalization, the misuse of these models represents a global problem
that requires taking a series of common measures in universities from different
geographical areas. In several countries, there has been a review of assessment
tools to ensure that work is done by students and not by AI. To this end, we
have conducted a detailed experiment in a representative subject of Computer
Science such as Software Engineering, which has focused on evaluating the use
of ChatGPT as an assistant in theory activities, exercises, and laboratory
practices, assessing its potential use as a support tool for both students and
teachers.

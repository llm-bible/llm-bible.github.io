Utility and topical relevance are critical measures in information retrieval (IR) reflecting system and user perspectives respectively. While topical relevance has long been emphasized utility is a higher standard of relevance and is more useful for facilitating downstream tasks e.g. in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). When we incorporate utility judgments into RAG we realize that the topical relevance utility and answering in RAG are closely related to the three types of relevance that Schutz discussed from a philosophical perspective. They are topical relevance interpretational relevance and motivational relevance respectively. Inspired by the dynamic iterations of the three types of relevance we propose an Iterative utiliTy judgmEnt fraMework (ITEM) to promote each step of the cycle of RAG. We conducted extensive experiments on multi-grade passage retrieval and factoid question-answering datasets (i.e. TREC DL WebAP and NQ). Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in utility judgments ranking of topical relevance and answer generation upon representative baselines including multiple single-shot utility judging approaches. Our code and benchmark can be found at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ITEM-B486/."

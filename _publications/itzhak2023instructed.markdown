Recent studies show that instruction tuning (IT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) improve the abilities of large language models (LMs) dramatically. While these tuning methods can help align models with human objectives and generate high45;quality text not much is known about their potential adverse effects. In this work we investigate the effect of IT and RLHF on decision making and reasoning in LMs focusing on three cognitive biases 45; the decoy effect the certainty effect and the belief bias 45; all of which are known to influence human decision45;making and reasoning. Our findings highlight the presence of these biases in various models from the GPT45;3 Mistral and T5 families. Notably we find a stronger presence of biases in models that have undergone instruction tuning such as Flan45;T5 Mistral45;Instruct GPT3.5 and GPT4. Our work constitutes a step toward comprehending cognitive biases in instruction45;tuned LMs which is crucial for the development of more reliable and unbiased language models.

How to incorporate external knowledge into a neural dialogue model is critically important for dialogue systems to behave like real humans. To handle this problem memory networks are usually a great choice and a promising way. However existing memory networks do not perform well when leveraging heterogeneous information from different sources. In this paper we propose a novel and versatile external memory networks called Heterogeneous Memory Networks (HMNs) to simultaneously utilize user utterances dialogue history and background knowledge tuples. In our method historical sequential dialogues are encoded and stored into the context45;aware memory enhanced by gating mechanism while grounding knowledge tuples are encoded and stored into the context45;free memory. During decoding the decoder augmented with HMNs recurrently selects each word in one response utterance from these two memories and a general vocabulary. Experimental results on multiple real45;world datasets show that HMNs significantly outperform the state45;of45;the45;art data45;driven task45;oriented dialogue models in most domains.

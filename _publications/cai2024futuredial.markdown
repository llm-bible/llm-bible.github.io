Recently, increasing research interests have focused on retrieval augmented
generation (RAG) to mitigate hallucination for large language models (LLMs).
Following this trend, we launch the FutureDial-RAG challenge at SLT 2024, which
aims at promoting the study of RAG for dialog systems. The challenge builds
upon the MobileCS2 dataset, a real-life customer service datasets with nearly
3000 high-quality dialogs containing annotations for knowledge base query and
corresponding results. Over the dataset, we define two tasks, track 1 for
knowledge retrieval and track 2 for response generation, which are core
research questions in dialog systems with RAG. We build baseline systems for
the two tracks and design metrics to measure whether the systems can perform
accurate retrieval and generate informative and coherent response. The baseline
results show that it is very challenging to perform well on the two tasks,
which encourages the participating teams and the community to study how to make
better use of RAG for real-life dialog systems.

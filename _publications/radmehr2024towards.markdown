There has been a growing interest in developing learner models to enhance learning and teaching experiences in educational environments. However existing works have primarily focused on structured environments relying on meticulously crafted representations of tasks thereby limiting the agents ability to generalize skills across tasks. In this paper we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of agents in open45;ended text45;based learning environments by integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Large Language Models (LLMs). We investigate three types of agents (i) RL45;based agents that utilize natural language for state and action representations to find the best interaction strategy (ii) LLM45;based agents that leverage the models general knowledge and reasoning through prompting and (iii) hybrid LLM45;assisted RL agents that combine these two strategies to improve agents performance and generalization. To support the development and evaluation of these agents we introduce PharmaSimText a novel benchmark derived from the PharmaSim virtual pharmacy environment designed for practicing diagnostic conversations. Our results show that RL45;based agents excel in task completion but lack in asking quality diagnostic questions. In contrast LLM45;based agents perform better in asking diagnostic questions but fall short of completing the task. Finally hybrid LLM45;assisted RL agents enable us to overcome these limitations highlighting the potential of combining RL and LLMs to develop high45;performing agents for open45;ended learning environments.

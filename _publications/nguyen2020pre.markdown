We present PhoBERT with two versions, PhoBERT-base and PhoBERT-large, the
first public large-scale monolingual language models pre-trained for
Vietnamese. Experimental results show that PhoBERT consistently outperforms the
recent best pre-trained multilingual model XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) and
improves the state-of-the-art in multiple Vietnamese-specific NLP tasks
including Part-of-speech tagging, Dependency parsing, Named-entity recognition
and Natural language inference. We release PhoBERT to facilitate future
research and downstream applications for Vietnamese NLP. Our PhoBERT models are
available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/PhoBERT

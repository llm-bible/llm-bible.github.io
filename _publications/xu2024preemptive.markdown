Large language models (LLMs) showcase impressive reasoning capabilities when coupled with Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) prompting. However the robustness of this approach warrants further investigation. In this paper we introduce a novel scenario termed preemptive answers where the LLM obtains an answer before engaging in reasoning. This situation can arise inadvertently or induced by malicious users by prompt injection attacks. Experiments reveal that preemptive answers significantly impair the models reasoning capability across various CoT methods and a broad spectrum of datasets. To bolster the robustness of reasoning we propose two measures aimed at mitigating this issue to some extent.

The recent emergence of deep learning methods has enabled the research community to achieve state-of-the art results in several domains including natural language processing. However the current robocall system remains unstable and inaccurate text generator and chat-bots can be tedious and misunderstand human-like dialogue. In this work we study the performance of two models able to enhance an intelligent conversational agent through adversarial conversational shaping a generative adversarial network with policy gradient (GANPG) and a generative adversarial network with reward for every generation step (REGS) based on the REGS model presented in Li et al. 18 . This model is able to assign rewards to both partially and fully generated text sequences. We discuss performance with different training details seq2seq 36 and transformers 37 in a reinforcement learning framework.

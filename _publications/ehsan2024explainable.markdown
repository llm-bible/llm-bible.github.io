When the initial vision of Explainable (XAI) was articulated the most popular framing was to open the (proverbial) black45;box of AI so that we could understand the inner workings. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) the very ability to open the black45;box is increasingly limited especially when it comes to non45;AI expert end45;users. In this paper we challenge the assumption of opening the black45;box in the LLM era and argue for a shift in our XAI expectations. Highlighting the epistemic blind spots of an algorithm45;centered XAI view we argue that a human45;centered perspective can be a path forward. We operationalize the argument by synthesizing XAI research along three dimensions explainability outside the black45;box explainability around the edges of the black box and explainability that leverages infrastructural seams. We conclude with takeaways that reflexively inform XAI as a domain.

This study explores the use of Generative AI chatbots for transforming public
science exhibits into virtual experiences that can extend the engagement of
exhibits into the classroom. The broader goal is to increase accessibility of
science exhibits, especially for those marginalized in STEM due to various
factors, including cultural barriers. We hypothesize that turning exhibits into
first-person anthropomorphized chatbots with a personality, like quirky-talking
asteroids or comets, can increase engagement and learning. The paper mainly
explores if such techniques are possible using Generative AI (e.g. GPT) via
prompt engineering alone. The research includes an investigation into the
possibility of integrating interactive assessment via question-generation using
Bloom's Taxonomy. Initial results indicate that it is possible to combine these
techniques. As such, it lays a foundation for future classroom evaluations of
such chatbots to gauge their overall efficacy in extending the reach of science
exhibitions. The paper concludes by discussing extensions of the research to
fully evaluate effectiveness in virtual field-trips. We also include a brief
examination of additional ways to enhance student motivation towards learning
via chatbots.

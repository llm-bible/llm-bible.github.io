This paper presents Megadiff, a dataset of source code diffs. It focuses on Java, with strict inclusion criteria based on commit message and diff size. Megadiff contains 663 029 Java diffs that can be used for research on commit comprehension, fault localization, automated program repair, and machine learning on code changes.

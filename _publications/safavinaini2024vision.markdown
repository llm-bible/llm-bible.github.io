Background and Aims This study evaluates the medical reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in gastroenterology. Methods We used 300 gastroenterology board exam-style multiple-choice questions 138 of which contain images to systematically assess the impact of model configurations and parameters and prompt engineering strategies utilizing GPT-3.5. Next we assessed the performance of proprietary and open-source LLMs (versions) including GPT (3.5 4 4o 4omini) Claude (3 3.5) Gemini (1.0) Mistral Llama (2 3 3.1) Mixtral and Phi (3) across different interfaces (web and API) computing environments (cloud and local) and model precisions (with and without quantization). Finally we assessed accuracy using a semiautomated pipeline. Results Among the proprietary models GPT-4o (73.7) and Claude3.5-Sonnet (74.0) achieved the highest accuracy outperforming the top open-source models Llama3.1-405b (64) Llama3.1-70b (58.3) and Mixtral-8x7b (54.3). Among the quantized open-source models the 6-bit quantized Phi3-14b (48.7) performed best. The scores of the quantized models were comparable to those of the full-precision models Llama2-7b Llama2--13b and Gemma2-9b. Notably VLM performance on image-containing questions did not improve when the images were provided and worsened when LLM-generated captions were provided. In contrast a 10 increase in accuracy was observed when images were accompanied by human-crafted image descriptions. Conclusion In conclusion while LLMs exhibit robust zero-shot performance in medical reasoning the integration of visual data remains a challenge for VLMs. Effective deployment involves carefully determining optimal model configurations encouraging users to consider either the high performance of proprietary models or the flexible adaptability of open-source models.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM applications across various domains including hardware design security intrusion detection software engineering design verification cyber threat intelligence malware detection and phishing detection. We present an overview of LLM evolution and its current state focusing on advancements in models such as GPT-4 GPT-3.5 Mixtral-8x7B BERT Falcon2 and LLaMA. Our analysis extends to LLM vulnerabilities such as prompt injection insecure output handling data poisoning DDoS attacks and adversarial instructions. We delve into mitigation strategies to protect these models providing a comprehensive look at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore we evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and hardware security highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing covering the lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research. In addition we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs including techniques like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ) Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) Quantized Low-Rank Adapters (QLoRA) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into future cybersecurity frameworks emphasizing innovation and robust model deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.

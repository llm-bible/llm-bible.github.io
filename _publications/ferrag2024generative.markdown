This paper provides a comprehensive review of the future of cybersecurity
through Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). We explore LLM
applications across various domains, including hardware design security,
intrusion detection, software engineering, design verification, cyber threat
intelligence, malware detection, and phishing detection. We present an overview
of LLM evolution and its current state, focusing on advancements in models such
as GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Mixtral-8x7B, BERT, Falcon2, and LLaMA. Our analysis extends
to LLM vulnerabilities, such as prompt injection, insecure output handling,
data poisoning, DDoS attacks, and adversarial instructions. We delve into
mitigation strategies to protect these models, providing a comprehensive look
at potential attack scenarios and prevention techniques. Furthermore, we
evaluate the performance of 42 LLM models in cybersecurity knowledge and
hardware security, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We thoroughly
evaluate cybersecurity datasets for LLM training and testing, covering the
lifecycle from data creation to usage and identifying gaps for future research.
In addition, we review new strategies for leveraging LLMs, including techniques
like Half-Quadratic Quantization (HQQ), Reinforcement Learning with Human
Feedback (RLHF), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Quantized Low-Rank
Adapters (QLoRA), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These insights aim
to enhance real-time cybersecurity defenses and improve the sophistication of
LLM applications in threat detection and response. Our paper provides a
foundational understanding and strategic direction for integrating LLMs into
future cybersecurity frameworks, emphasizing innovation and robust model
deployment to safeguard against evolving cyber threats.

Recently Large Language Models (LLM) have demonstrated impressive capability to solve a wide range of tasks. However despite their success across various tasks no prior work has investigated their capability in the biomedical domain yet. To this end this paper aims to evaluate the performance of LLMs on benchmark biomedical tasks. For this purpose we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 4 popular LLMs in 6 diverse biomedical tasks across 26 datasets. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that conducts an extensive evaluation and comparison of various LLMs in the biomedical domain. Interestingly we find based on our evaluation that in biomedical datasets that have smaller training sets zero45;shot LLMs even outperform the current state45;of45;the45;art fine45;tuned biomedical models. This suggests that pretraining on large text corpora makes LLMs quite specialized even in the biomedical domain. We also find that not a single LLM can outperform other LLMs in all tasks with the performance of different LLMs may vary depending on the task. While their performance is still quite poor in comparison to the biomedical models that were fine45;tuned on large training sets our findings demonstrate that LLMs have the potential to be a valuable tool for various biomedical tasks that lack large annotated data.

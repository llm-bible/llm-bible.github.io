This paper explores the nuanced landscape of generative AI (genAI),
particularly focusing on neural network-based models like Large Language Models
(LLMs). While genAI garners both optimistic enthusiasm and sceptical criticism,
this work seeks to provide a balanced examination of its capabilities,
limitations, and the profound impact it may have on societal functions and
personal interactions. The first section demystifies language-based genAI
through detailed discussions on how LLMs learn, their computational needs,
distinguishing features from supporting technologies, and the inherent
limitations in their accuracy and reliability. Real-world examples illustrate
the practical applications and implications of these technologies. The latter
part of the paper adopts a systems perspective, evaluating how the integration
of LLMs with existing technologies can enhance productivity and address
emerging concerns. It highlights the need for significant investment to
understand the implications of recent advancements, advocating for a
well-informed dialogue to ethically and responsibly integrate genAI into
diverse sectors. The paper concludes with prospective developments and
recommendations, emphasizing a forward-looking approach to harnessing genAI`s
potential while mitigating its risks.

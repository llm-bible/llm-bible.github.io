Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
mainstream academic disciplines such as mathematics, physics, and computer
science. However, human knowledge encompasses over 200 specialized disciplines,
far exceeding the scope of existing benchmarks. The capabilities of LLMs in
many of these specialized fields-particularly in light industry, agriculture,
and service-oriented disciplines-remain inadequately evaluated. To address this
gap, we present SuperGPQA, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates
graduate-level knowledge and reasoning capabilities across 285 disciplines. Our
benchmark employs a novel Human-LLM collaborative filtering mechanism to
eliminate trivial or ambiguous questions through iterative refinement based on
both LLM responses and expert feedback. Our experimental results reveal
significant room for improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art
LLMs across diverse knowledge domains (e.g., the reasoning-focused model
DeepSeek-R1 achieved the highest accuracy of 61.82% on SuperGPQA), highlighting
the considerable gap between current model capabilities and artificial general
intelligence. Additionally, we present comprehensive insights from our
management of a large-scale annotation process, involving over 80 expert
annotators and an interactive Human-LLM collaborative system, offering valuable
methodological guidance for future research initiatives of comparable scope.

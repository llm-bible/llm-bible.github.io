This paper delves into the realm of ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that
utilizes topic modeling and reinforcement learning to generate natural
responses. Although ChatGPT holds immense promise across various industries,
such as customer service, education, mental health treatment, personal
productivity, and content creation, it is essential to address its security,
privacy, and ethical implications. By exploring the upgrade path from GPT-1 to
GPT-4, discussing the model's features, limitations, and potential
applications, this study aims to shed light on the potential risks of
integrating ChatGPT into our daily lives. Focusing on security, privacy, and
ethics issues, we highlight the challenges these concerns pose for widespread
adoption. Finally, we analyze the open problems in these areas, calling for
concerted efforts to ensure the development of secure and ethically sound large
language models.

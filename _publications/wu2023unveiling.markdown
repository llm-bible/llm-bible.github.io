Although ChatGPT holds immense promise across various industries such as customer service education mental health treatment personal productivity and content creation it is essential to address its security privacy and ethical implications. By exploring the upgrade path from GPT-1 to GPT-4 discussing the models features limitations and potential applications this study aims to shed light on the potential risks of integrating ChatGPT into our daily lives. Focusing on security privacy and ethics issues we highlight the challenges these concerns pose for widespread adoption. Finally we analyze the open problems in these areas calling for concerted efforts to ensure the development of secure and ethically sound large language models.

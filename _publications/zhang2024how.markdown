Vision45;Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT45;4V have recently demonstrated incredible strides on diverse vision language tasks. We dig into vision45;based deductive reasoning a more sophisticated but less explored realm and find previously unexposed blindspots in the current SOTA VLMs. Specifically we leverage Ravens Progressive Matrices (RPMs) to assess VLMs abilities to perform multi45;hop relational and deductive reasoning relying solely on visual clues. We perform comprehensive evaluations of several popular VLMs employing standard strategies such as in45;context learning self45;consistency and Chain45;of45;thoughts (CoT) on three diverse datasets including the Mensa IQ test IntelligenceTest and RAVEN. The results reveal that despite the impressive capabilities of LLMs in text45;based reasoning we are still far from achieving comparable proficiency in visual deductive reasoning. We found that certain standard strategies that are effective when applied to LLMs do not seamlessly translate to the challenges presented by visual reasoning tasks. Moreover a detailed analysis reveals that VLMs struggle to solve these tasks mainly because they are unable to perceive and comprehend multiple confounding abstract patterns in RPM examples.

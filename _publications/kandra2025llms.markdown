It has been frequently observed that human speakers align their language use
with each other during conversations. In this paper, we study empirically
whether large language models (LLMs) exhibit the same behavior of
conversational adaptation. We construct a corpus of conversations between LLMs
and find that two LLM agents end up making more similar syntactic choices as
conversations go on, confirming that modern LLMs adapt their language use to
their conversational partners in at least a rudimentary way.

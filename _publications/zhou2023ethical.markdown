Large language models e.g. ChatGPT are currently contributing enormously to make artificial intelligence even more popular especially among the general population. However such chatbot models were developed as tools to support natural language communication between humans. Problematically it is very much a statistical correlation machine (correlation instead of causality) and there are indeed ethical concerns associated with the use of AI language models such as ChatGPT such as Bias Privacy and Abuse. This paper highlights specific ethical concerns on ChatGPT and articulates key challenges when ChatGPT is used in various applications. Practical commandments for different stakeholders of ChatGPT are also proposed that can serve as checklist guidelines for those applying ChatGPT in their applications. These commandment examples are expected to motivate the ethical use of ChatGPT.

Large language models, e.g. ChatGPT are currently contributing enormously to
make artificial intelligence even more popular, especially among the general
population. However, such chatbot models were developed as tools to support
natural language communication between humans. Problematically, it is very much
a ``statistical correlation machine" (correlation instead of causality) and
there are indeed ethical concerns associated with the use of AI language models
such as ChatGPT, such as Bias, Privacy, and Abuse. This paper highlights
specific ethical concerns on ChatGPT and articulates key challenges when
ChatGPT is used in various applications. Practical commandments for different
stakeholders of ChatGPT are also proposed that can serve as checklist
guidelines for those applying ChatGPT in their applications. These commandment
examples are expected to motivate the ethical use of ChatGPT.

Open-ended question answering requires models to find appropriate evidence to
form wellreasoned, comprehensive and helpful answers. In practical
applications, models also need to engage in extended discussions on potential
scenarios closely relevant to the question. With augmentation of retrieval
module, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce coherent answers
often with different focuses, but are still sub-optimal in terms of reliable
evidence selection and in-depth question analysis. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-ofDiscussion framework to leverage the synergy among multiple
open-source LLMs aiming to provide more correct and more comprehensive answers
for open-ended QA, although they are not strong enough individually. Our
experiments show that discussions among multiple LLMs play a vital role in
enhancing the quality of answers.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enhances large language models (LLMs) by
decomposing complex problems into step-by-step solutions, improving performance
on reasoning tasks. However, current CoT disclosure policies vary widely across
different models in frontend visibility, API access, and pricing strategies,
lacking a unified policy framework. This paper analyzes the dual-edged
implications of full CoT disclosure: while it empowers small-model
distillation, fosters trust, and enables error diagnosis, it also risks
violating intellectual property, enabling misuse, and incurring operational
costs. We propose a tiered-access policy framework that balances transparency,
accountability, and security by tailoring CoT availability to academic,
business, and general users through ethical licensing, structured reasoning
outputs, and cross-tier safeguards. By harmonizing accessibility with ethical
and operational considerations, this framework aims to advance responsible AI
deployment while mitigating risks of misuse or misinterpretation.

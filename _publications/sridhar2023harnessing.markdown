We evaluated the capability of a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT-4) to automatically generate high-quality learning objectives (LOs) in the context of a practically oriented university course on Artificial Intelligence. Discussions of opportunities (e.g. content generation explanation) and risks (e.g. cheating) of this emerging technology in education have intensified but to date there has not been a study of the models capabilities in supporting the course design and authoring of LOs. LOs articulate the knowledge and skills learners are intended to acquire by engaging with a course. To be effective LOs must focus on what students are intended to achieve focus on specific cognitive processes and be measurable. Thus authoring high-quality LOs is a challenging and time consuming (i.e. expensive) effort. We evaluated 127 LOs that were automatically generated based on a carefully crafted prompt (detailed guidelines on high-quality LOs authoring) submitted to GPT-4 for conceptual modules and projects of an AI Practitioner course. We analyzed the generated LOs if they follow certain best practices such as beginning with action verbs from Blooms taxonomy in regards to the level of sophistication intended. Our analysis showed that the generated LOs are sensible properly expressed (e.g. starting with an action verb) and that they largely operate at the appropriate level of Blooms taxonomy respecting the different nature of the conceptual modules (lower levels) and projects (higher levels). Our results can be leveraged by instructors and curricular designers wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support their curricular and course design efforts.

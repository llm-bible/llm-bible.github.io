Understanding the internal mechanisms by which multi-modal large language models (LLMs) interpret different modalities and integrate cross-modal representations is becoming increasingly critical for continuous improvements in both academia and industry. In this paper we propose a novel method to identify key neurons for interpretability -- how multi-modal LLMs bridge visual and textual concepts for captioning. Our method improves conventional works upon efficiency and applied range by removing needs of costly gradient computation. Based on those identified neurons we further design a multi-modal knowledge editing method beneficial to mitigate sensitive words or hallucination. For rationale of our design we provide theoretical assumption. For empirical evaluation we have conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments. The results not only validate the effectiveness of our methods but also offer insightful findings that highlight three key properties of multi-modal neurons sensitivity specificity and causal-effect to shed light for future research.

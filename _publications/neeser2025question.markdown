We present QuOTE (Question-Oriented Text Embeddings), a novel enhancement to
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, aimed at improving document
representation for accurate and nuanced retrieval. Unlike traditional RAG
pipelines, which rely on embedding raw text chunks, QuOTE augments chunks with
hypothetical questions that the chunk can potentially answer, enriching the
representation space. This better aligns document embeddings with user query
semantics, and helps address issues such as ambiguity and context-dependent
relevance. Through extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks, we
demonstrate that QuOTE significantly enhances retrieval accuracy, including in
multi-hop question-answering tasks. Our findings highlight the versatility of
question generation as a fundamental indexing strategy, opening new avenues for
integrating question generation into retrieval-based AI pipelines.

Extended sequence generation often leads to degradation in contextual
consistency due to the inability of conventional self-attention mechanisms to
effectively retain long-range dependencies. Existing approaches, including
memory compression and retrieval-augmented conditioning, introduce
computational trade-offs that either increase inference latency or impose
additional storage overhead. Structured Context Recomposition (SCR) introduces
a probabilistic layer realignment strategy that dynamically adjusts learned
representations within transformer layers, ensuring that semantically relevant
embeddings persist throughout extended transformations. The proposed method
enhances coherence retention through a recursive weighting function that
redistributes representational emphasis based on inferred contextual relevance
rather than relying on fixed token-level attention scores. Empirical results
indicate that probabilistic realignment mitigates abrupt topic shifts and
logical inconsistencies, particularly in scenarios where sequences exceed
standard attention window constraints. Sequence-level entropy analysis further
reveals that SCR moderates representational variability without introducing
excessive output regularization, allowing models to sustain generative
diversity while preserving contextual alignment. Attention head deviation
measurements confirm that hierarchical reweighting contributes to smoother
token dependency transitions across transformer layers, reinforcing the
stability of multi-turn interactions and document-level reasoning.
Computational resource assessments show that while SCR incurs a moderate
increase in processing time, memory overhead remains within feasible limits,
making it suitable for practical deployment in autoregressive generative
applications.

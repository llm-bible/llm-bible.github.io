The recent success of general-domain large language models (LLMs) has significantly changed the natural language processing paradigm towards a unified foundation model across domains and applications. In this paper we focus on assessing the performance of GPT-4 the most capable LLM so far on the text-based applications for radiology reports comparing against state-of-the-art (SOTA) radiology-specific models. Exploring various prompting strategies we evaluated GPT-4 on a diverse range of common radiology tasks and we found GPT-4 either outperforms or is on par with current SOTA radiology models. With zero-shot prompting GPT-4 already obtains substantial gains (≈ 1037; absolute improvement) over radiology models in temporal sentence similarity classification (accuracy) and natural language inference (F_1). For tasks that require learning dataset-specific style or schema (e.g. findings summarisation) GPT-4 improves with example-based prompting and matches supervised SOTA. Our extensive error analysis with a board-certified radiologist shows GPT-4 has a sufficient level of radiology knowledge with only occasional errors in complex context that require nuanced domain knowledge. For findings summarisation GPT-4 outputs are found to be overall comparable with existing manually-written impressions.

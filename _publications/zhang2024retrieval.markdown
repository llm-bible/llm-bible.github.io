Open-domain semantic parsing remains a challenging task, as models often rely
on heuristics and struggle to handle unseen concepts. In this paper, we
investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) for this task and
introduce Retrieval-Augmented Semantic Parsing (RASP), a simple yet effective
approach that integrates external lexical knowledge into the parsing process.
Our experiments not only show that LLMs outperform previous encoder-decoder
baselines for semantic parsing, but that RASP further enhances their ability to
predict unseen concepts, nearly doubling the performance of previous models on
out-of-distribution concepts. These findings highlight the promise of
leveraging large language models and retrieval mechanisms for robust and
open-domain semantic parsing.

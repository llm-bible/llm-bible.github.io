We introduce LAMBADA, a dataset to evaluate the capabilities of computational
models for text understanding by means of a word prediction task. LAMBADA is a
collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects
are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but
not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on
LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be
able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that
LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of
several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this
novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to
encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of
broad context in natural language text.

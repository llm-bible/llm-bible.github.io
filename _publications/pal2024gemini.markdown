Large language models have the potential to be valuable in the healthcare
industry, but it's crucial to verify their safety and effectiveness through
rigorous evaluation. For this purpose, we comprehensively evaluated both
open-source LLMs and Google's new multimodal LLM called Gemini across Medical
reasoning, hallucination detection, and Medical Visual Question Answering
tasks. While Gemini showed competence, it lagged behind state-of-the-art models
like MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in diagnostic accuracy. Additionally, Gemini achieved
an accuracy of 61.45% on the medical VQA dataset, significantly lower than
GPT-4V's score of 88%. Our analysis revealed that Gemini is highly susceptible
to hallucinations, overconfidence, and knowledge gaps, which indicate risks if
deployed uncritically. We also performed a detailed analysis by medical subject
and test type, providing actionable feedback for developers and clinicians. To
mitigate risks, we applied prompting strategies that improved performance.
Additionally, we facilitated future research and development by releasing a
Python module for medical LLM evaluation and establishing a dedicated
leaderboard on Hugging Face for medical domain LLMs. Python module can be found

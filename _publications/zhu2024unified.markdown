In the multi45;modal domain the dependence of various models on specific input formats leads to user confusion and hinders progress. To address this challenge we introduce textbf123;LLMBind125; a novel framework designed to unify a diverse array of multi45;modal tasks. By harnessing a Mixture45;of45;Experts (MoE) Large Language Model (LLM) LLMBind processes multi45;modal inputs and generates task45;specific tokens enabling the invocation of corresponding models to accomplish tasks. This unique approach empowers LLMBind to interpret inputs and generate outputs across various modalities including image text video and audio. Furthermore we have constructed an interaction dataset comprising 400k instructions which unlocks the ability of LLMBind for interactive visual generation and editing tasks. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that LLMBind achieves very superior performance across diverse tasks and outperforms existing models in user evaluations conducted in real45;world scenarios. Moreover the adaptability of LLMBind allows for seamless integration with the latest models and extension to new modality tasks highlighting its potential to serve as a unified AI agent for modeling universal modalities.

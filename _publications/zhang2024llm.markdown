This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current status and opportunities for Large Language Models (LLMs) in strategic reasoning a sophisticated form of reasoning that necessitates understanding and predicting adversary actions in multi45;agent settings while adjusting strategies accordingly. Strategic reasoning is distinguished by its focus on the dynamic and uncertain nature of interactions among multi45;agents where comprehending the environment and anticipating the behavior of others is crucial. We explore the scopes applications methodologies and evaluation metrics related to strategic reasoning with LLMs highlighting the burgeoning development in this area and the interdisciplinary approaches enhancing their decision45;making performance. It aims to systematize and clarify the scattered literature on this subject providing a systematic review that underscores the importance of strategic reasoning as a critical cognitive capability and offers insights into future research directions and potential improvements.

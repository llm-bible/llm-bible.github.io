This study presents an innovative enhancement to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems by seamlessly integrating fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) with vector databases. This integration capitalizes on the combined strengths of structured data retrieval and the nuanced comprehension provided by advanced LLMs. Central to our approach are the LoRA and QLoRA methodologies which stand at the forefront of model refinement through parameter-efficient fine-tuning and memory optimization. A novel feature of our research is the incorporation of user feedback directly into the training process ensuring the models continuous adaptation to user expectations and thus improving its performance and applicability. Additionally we introduce a Quantized Influence Measure (QIM) as an innovative AI Judge mechanism to enhance the precision of result selection further refining the systems accuracy. Accompanied by an executive diagram and a detailed algorithm for fine-tuning QLoRA our work provides a comprehensive framework for implementing these advancements within chatbot technologies. This research contributes significant insights into LLM optimization for specific uses and heralds new directions for further development in retrieval-augmented models. Through extensive experimentation and analysis our findings lay a robust foundation for future advancements in chatbot technology and retrieval systems marking a significant step forward in the creation of more sophisticated precise and user-centric conversational AI systems.

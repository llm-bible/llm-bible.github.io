We consider enhancing large language models (LLMs) for complex planning
tasks. While existing methods allow LLMs to explore intermediate steps to make
plans, they either depend on unreliable self-verification or external verifiers
to evaluate these steps, which demand significant data and computations. Here,
we propose automated heuristics discovery (AutoHD), a novel approach that
enables LLMs to explicitly generate heuristic functions to guide inference-time
search, allowing accurate evaluation of intermediate states. These heuristic
functions are further refined through a heuristic evolution process, improving
their robustness and effectiveness. Our proposed method requires no additional
model training or fine-tuning, and the explicit definition of heuristic
functions generated by the LLMs provides interpretability and insights into the
reasoning process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate
significant gains over multiple baselines, including nearly twice the accuracy
on some datasets, establishing our approach as a reliable and interpretable
solution for complex planning tasks.

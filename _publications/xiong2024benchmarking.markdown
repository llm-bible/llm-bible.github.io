While large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on a wide range of medical question answering (QA) tasks, they still face
challenges with hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) is a promising solution and has been widely adopted. However,
a RAG system can involve multiple flexible components, and there is a lack of
best practices regarding the optimal RAG setting for various medical purposes.
To systematically evaluate such systems, we propose the Medical Information
Retrieval-Augmented Generation Evaluation (MIRAGE), a first-of-its-kind
benchmark including 7,663 questions from five medical QA datasets. Using
MIRAGE, we conducted large-scale experiments with over 1.8 trillion prompt
tokens on 41 combinations of different corpora, retrievers, and backbone LLMs
through the MedRAG toolkit introduced in this work. Overall, MedRAG improves
the accuracy of six different LLMs by up to 18% over chain-of-thought
prompting, elevating the performance of GPT-3.5 and Mixtral to GPT-4-level. Our
results show that the combination of various medical corpora and retrievers
achieves the best performance. In addition, we discovered a log-linear scaling
property and the "lost-in-the-middle" effects in medical RAG. We believe our
comprehensive evaluations can serve as practical guidelines for implementing
RAG systems for medicine.

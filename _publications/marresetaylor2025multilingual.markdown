In this paper, we propose the first multilingual study on definition modeling. We use monolingual dictionary data for four new languages (Spanish, French, Portuguese, and German) and perform an in-depth empirical study to test the performance of pre-trained multilingual language models on definition modeling of monosemic words when finetuned on this data. Furthermore, we use a zero-shot approach to test the multilingual capabilities of two popular chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) in the task. Results show that multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

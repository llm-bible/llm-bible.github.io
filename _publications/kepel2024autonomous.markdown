Prompt engineering is a crucial yet challenging task for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs) on customized tasks. This pioneering research introduces the Automatic Prompt Engineering Toolbox (APET) which enables GPT-4 to autonomously apply prompt engineering techniques. By leveraging sophisticated strategies such as Expert Prompting Chain of Thought and Tree of Thoughts APET empowers GPT-4 to dynamically optimize prompts resulting in substantial improvements in tasks like Word Sorting (4.437; increase) and Geometric Shapes (6.837; increase). Despite encountering challenges in complex tasks such as Checkmate in One (-14.837;) these findings demonstrate the transformative potential of APET in automating complex prompt optimization processes without the use of external data. Overall this research represents a significant leap in AI development presenting a robust framework for future innovations in autonomous AI systems and highlighting the ability of GPT-4 to bring prompt engineering theory to practice. It establishes a foundation for enhancing performance in complex task performance and broadening the practical applications of these techniques in real-world scenarios.

While large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown impressive capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks a systematic investigation of their potential in this field remains largely unexplored. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the following questions (1) How are LLMs currently applied to NLP tasks in the literature (2) Have traditional NLP tasks already been solved with LLMs (3) What is the future of the LLMs for NLP To answer these questions we take the first step to provide a comprehensive overview of LLMs in NLP. Specifically we first introduce a unified taxonomy including (1) parameter-frozen application and (2) parameter-tuning application to offer a unified perspective for understanding the current progress of LLMs in NLP. Furthermore we summarize the new frontiers and the associated challenges aiming to inspire further groundbreaking advancements. We hope this work offers valuable insights into the potential and limitations of LLMs in NLP while also serving as a practical guide for building effective LLMs in NLP.

Large language models show a surprising in45;context learning ability 45;45; being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query yet without additional training in stark contrast to old45;fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real45;valued spins where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre45;training and most importantly why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without training. Our theory reveals that for single instance learning increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of the in45;context learning by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre45;trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed spin glass model thus establishes a foundation to understand the empirical success of large language models.

Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next45;generation educational technologies for introductory programming. Recent works have studied these models for different scenarios relevant to programming education; however these works are limited for several reasons as they typically consider already outdated models or only specific scenario(s). Consequently there is a lack of a systematic study that benchmarks state45;of45;the45;art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work we systematically evaluate two models ChatGPT (based on GPT45;3.5) and GPT45;4 and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios. We evaluate using five introductory Python programming problems and real45;world buggy programs from an online platform and assess performance using expert45;based annotations. Our results show that GPT45;4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT45;3.5) and comes close to human tutors performance for several scenarios. These results also highlight settings where GPT45;4 still struggles providing exciting future directions on developing techniques to improve the performance of these models.

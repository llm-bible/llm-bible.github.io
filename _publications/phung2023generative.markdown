Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing computing education by powering next-generation educational technologies for introductory programming. Recent works have studied these models for different scenarios relevant to programming education; however these works are limited for several reasons as they typically consider already outdated models or only specific scenario(s). Consequently there is a lack of a systematic study that benchmarks state-of-the-art models for a comprehensive set of programming education scenarios. In our work we systematically evaluate two models ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and GPT-4 and compare their performance with human tutors for a variety of scenarios. We evaluate using five introductory Python programming problems and real-world buggy programs from an online platform and assess performance using expert-based annotations. Our results show that GPT-4 drastically outperforms ChatGPT (based on GPT-3.5) and comes close to human tutors performance for several scenarios. These results also highlight settings where GPT-4 still struggles providing exciting future directions on developing techniques to improve the performance of these models.

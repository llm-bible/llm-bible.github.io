We introduce EQ45;Bench a novel benchmark designed to evaluate aspects of emotional intelligence in Large Language Models (LLMs). We assess the ability of LLMs to understand complex emotions and social interactions by asking them to predict the intensity of emotional states of characters in a dialogue. The benchmark is able to discriminate effectively between a wide range of models. We find that EQ45;Bench correlates strongly with comprehensive multi45;domain benchmarks like MMLU (Hendrycks et al. 2020) (r=0.97) indicating that we may be capturing similar aspects of broad intelligence. Our benchmark produces highly repeatable results using a set of 60 English45;language questions. We also provide open45;source code for an automated benchmarking pipeline at https://github.com/EQ&#45;bench/EQ&#45;Bench and a leaderboard at https://eqbench.com

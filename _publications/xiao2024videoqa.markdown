Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are flourishing and has advanced many video-language tasks. As a golden testbed Video Question Answering (VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a timely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs behavior in VideoQA aiming to elucidate their success and failure modes and provide insights towards more human-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate that Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and generate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However models falter in handling video temporality both in reasoning about temporal content ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover the models behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video perturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers and questions. Also they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings demonstrate Video-LLMs QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their severe deficiency in robustness and interpretability suggesting the urgent need on rationales in Video-LLM developing.

As large language models (LLMs) grow increasingly adept at processing
unstructured text data, they offer new opportunities to enhance data curation
workflows. This paper explores the evolution of LLM adoption among
practitioners at a large technology company, evaluating the impact of LLMs in
data curation tasks through participants' perceptions, integration strategies,
and reported usage scenarios. Through a series of surveys, interviews, and user
studies, we provide a timely snapshot of how organizations are navigating a
pivotal moment in LLM evolution. In Q2 2023, we conducted a survey to assess
LLM adoption in industry for development tasks (N=84), and facilitated expert
interviews to assess evolving data needs (N=10) in Q3 2023. In Q2 2024, we
explored practitioners' current and anticipated LLM usage through a user study
involving two LLM-based prototypes (N=12). While each study addressed distinct
research goals, they revealed a broader narrative about evolving LLM usage in
aggregate. We discovered an emerging shift in data understanding from
heuristic-first, bottom-up approaches to insights-first, top-down workflows
supported by LLMs. Furthermore, to respond to a more complex data landscape,
data practitioners now supplement traditional subject-expert-created 'golden
datasets' with LLM-generated 'silver' datasets and rigorously validated 'super
golden' datasets curated by diverse experts. This research sheds light on the
transformative role of LLMs in large-scale analysis of unstructured data and
highlights opportunities for further tool development.

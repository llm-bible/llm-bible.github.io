Logs are an essential part  of  the  development  and
maintenance  of  large  and  complex  software  systems  as  they
contain rich information pertaining to the dynamic content and
state  of  the  system.  As  such,  developers  and  practitioners  rely
heavily  on  the  logs  to  monitor  their  systems.  In  parallel,  the
increasing  volume  and  scale  of  the  logs,  due  to  the  growing
complexity  of  modern  software  systems,  renders  the  traditional
way  of  manual  log  inspection  insurmountable.  Consequently,  to
handle  large  volumes  of  logs  efficiently  and  effectively,  various
prior research aims to automate the analysis of log files. Thus, in
this paper, we begin with the hypothesis that log files are natural
and local and these attributes can be applied for automating log
analysis tasks. We guide our research with six research questions
with regards to the naturalness and localness of the log files, and
present  a  case  study  on  anomaly  detection  and  introduce  a  tool
for anomaly detection, called ANALOG, to demonstrate how our
new  findings  facilitate  the  automated  analysis  of  logs.

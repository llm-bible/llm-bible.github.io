This study demonstrates the application of instruction finetuning of
pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of AI
research leaderboards, extracting (Task, Dataset, Metric, Score) quadruples
from articles. It aims to streamline the dissemination of advancements in AI
research by transitioning from traditional, manual community curation, or
otherwise taxonomy-constrained natural language inference (NLI) models, to an
automated, generative LLM-based approach. Utilizing the FLAN-T5 model, this
research enhances LLMs' adaptability and reliability in information extraction,
offering a novel method for structured knowledge representation.

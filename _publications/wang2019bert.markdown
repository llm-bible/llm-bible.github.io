We show that BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) is a Markov random field language
model. This formulation gives way to a natural procedure to sample sentences
from BERT. We generate from BERT and find that it can produce high-quality,
fluent generations. Compared to the generations of a traditional left-to-right
language model, BERT generates sentences that are more diverse but of slightly
worse quality.

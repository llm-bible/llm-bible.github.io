Objective Most existing fine-tuned biomedical large language models (LLMs) focus on enhancing performance in monolingual biomedical question answering and conversation tasks. To investigate the effectiveness of the fine-tuned LLMs on diverse biomedical NLP tasks in different languages We present Taiyi a bilingual fine-tuned LLM for diverse biomedical tasks. Materials and Methods We first curated a comprehensive collection of 140 existing biomedical text mining datasets (102 English and 38 Chinese datasets) across over 10 task types. Subsequently a two-stage strategy is proposed for supervised fine-tuning to optimize the model performance across varied tasks. Results Experimental results on 13 test sets covering named entity recognition relation extraction text classification question answering tasks demonstrate that Taiyi achieves superior performance compared to general LLMs. The case study involving additional biomedical NLP tasks further shows Taiyis considerable potential for bilingual biomedical multi-tasking. Conclusion Leveraging rich high-quality biomedical corpora and developing effective fine-tuning strategies can significantly improve the performance of LLMs within the biomedical domain. Taiyi shows the bilingual multi-tasking capability through supervised fine-tuning. However those tasks such as information extraction that are not generation tasks in nature remain challenging for LLM-based generative approaches and they still underperform the conventional discriminative approaches of smaller language models.

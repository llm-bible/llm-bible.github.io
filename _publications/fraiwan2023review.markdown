ChatGPT is a type of artificial intelligence language model that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human45;like responses to text45;based prompts. The introduction of the latest ChatGPT version in November of 2022 has caused shockwaves in the industrial and academic communities for its powerful capabilities plethora of possible applications and the great possibility for abuse. At the time of writing this work several other language models (e.g. Google Bard and Meta LLaMA) just came out in an attempt to get a foothold in the vast possible market. These models have the ability to revolutionize the way we interact with computers and have potential applications in many fields including education software engineering healthcare and marketing. In this paper we will discuss the possible applications drawbacks and research directions using advanced language Chatbots (e.g. ChatGPT) in each of these fields. We first start with a brief introduction and the development timeline of artificial intelligence based language models then we go through possible applications of such models after that we discuss the limitations and drawbacks of the current technological state of the art and finally we point out future possible research directions.

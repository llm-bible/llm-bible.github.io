The development of chatbots requires collecting a large number of
human-chatbot dialogues to reflect the breadth of users' sociodemographic
backgrounds and conversational goals. However, the resource requirements to
conduct the respective user studies can be prohibitively high and often only
allow for a narrow analysis of specific dialogue goals and participant
demographics. In this paper, we propose LLM Roleplay: a goal-oriented,
persona-based method to automatically generate diverse multi-turn dialogues
simulating human-chatbot interaction. LLM Roleplay can be applied to generate
dialogues with any type of chatbot and uses large language models (LLMs) to
play the role of textually described personas. To validate our method, we
collect natural human-chatbot dialogues from different sociodemographic groups
and conduct a user study to compare these with our generated dialogues. We
evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs in maintaining a
conversation during their embodiment of a specific persona and find that our
method can simulate human-chatbot dialogues with a high indistinguishability
rate.

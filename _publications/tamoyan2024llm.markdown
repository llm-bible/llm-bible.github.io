The development of chatbots requires collecting a large number of human45;chatbot dialogues to reflect the breadth of users sociodemographic backgrounds and conversational goals. However the resource requirements to conduct the respective user studies can be prohibitively high and often only allow for a narrow analysis of specific dialogue goals and participant demographics. In this paper we propose LLM45;Roleplay a goal45;oriented persona45;based method to automatically generate diverse multi45;turn dialogues simulating human45;chatbot interaction. LLM45;Roleplay can be applied to generate dialogues with any type of chatbot and uses large language models (LLMs) to play the role of textually described personas. To validate our method we collect natural human45;chatbot dialogues from different sociodemographic groups and conduct a human evaluation to compare real human45;chatbot dialogues with our generated dialogues. We compare the abilities of state45;of45;the45;art LLMs in embodying personas and holding a conversation and find that our method can simulate human45;chatbot dialogues with a high indistinguishability rate.

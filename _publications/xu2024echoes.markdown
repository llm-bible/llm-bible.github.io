With rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), there has been an
increasing application of LLMs in creative content ideation and generation. A
critical question emerges: can current LLMs provide ideas that are diverse
enough to truly bolster the collective creativity? We examine two
state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and LLaMA-3, on story generation and discover that
LLM-generated stories often consist of plot elements that are echoed across a
number of generations. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce the Sui
Generis score, which estimates how unlikely a plot element is to appear in
alternative storylines generated by the same LLM. Evaluating on 100 short
stories, we find that LLM-generated stories often contain combinations of
idiosyncratic plot elements echoed frequently across generations, while the
original human-written stories are rarely recreated or even echoed in pieces.
Moreover, our human evaluation shows that the ranking of Sui Generis scores
among story segments correlates moderately with human judgment of surprise
level, even though score computation is completely automatic without relying on
human judgment.

This paper introduces the Conversational Factor Information Retrieval Method
(ConFIRM), a novel approach to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for
domain-specific retrieval tasks. ConFIRM leverages the Five-Factor Model of
personality to generate synthetic datasets that accurately reflect target
population characteristics, addressing data scarcity in specialized domains. We
demonstrate ConFIRM's effectiveness through a case study in the finance sector,
fine-tuning a Llama-2-7b model using personality-aligned data from the
PolyU-Asklora Fintech Adoption Index. The resulting model achieved 91% accuracy
in classifying financial queries, with an average inference time of 0.61
seconds on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. ConFIRM shows promise for creating more accurate
and personalized AI-driven information retrieval systems across various
domains, potentially mitigating issues of hallucinations and outdated
information in LLMs deployed

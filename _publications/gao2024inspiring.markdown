With the advent of large language models(LLMs) enhanced by the chain45;of45;thought(CoT) methodology visual reasoning problem is usually decomposed into manageable sub45;tasks and tackled sequentially with various external tools. However such a paradigm faces the challenge of the potential determining hallucinations in decision45;making due to insufficient visual information and the limitation of low45;level perception tools that fail to provide abstract summaries necessary for comprehensive reasoning. We argue that converging visual context acquisition and logical reasoning is pivotal for tackling visual reasoning tasks. This paper delves into the realm of multimodal CoT to solve intricate visual reasoning tasks with multimodal large language models(MLLMs) and their cognitive capability. To this end we propose an innovative multimodal CoT framework termed Cantor characterized by a perception45;decision architecture. Cantor first acts as a decision generator and integrates visual inputs to analyze the image and problem ensuring a closer alignment with the actual context. Furthermore Cantor leverages the advanced cognitive functions of MLLMs to perform as multifaceted experts for deriving higher45;level information enhancing the CoT generation process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework showing significant improvements in multimodal CoT performance across two complex visual reasoning datasets without necessitating fine45;tuning or ground45;truth rationales.

Despite the rapid development of video Large Language Models (LLMs) a comprehensive evaluation is still absent. In this paper we introduce a unified evaluation that encompasses multiple video tasks including captioning question and answering retrieval and action recognition. In addition to conventional metrics we showcase how GPT45;based evaluation can match human45;like performance in assessing response quality across multiple aspects. We propose a simple baseline Video45;LLaVA which uses a single linear projection and outperforms existing video LLMs. Finally we evaluate video LLMs beyond academic datasets which show encouraging recognition and reasoning capabilities in driving scenarios with only hundreds of video45;instruction pairs for fine45;tuning. We hope our work can serve as a unified evaluation for video LLMs and help expand more practical scenarios. The evaluation code will be available soon.

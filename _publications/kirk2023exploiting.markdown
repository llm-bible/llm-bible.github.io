Large language models (LLMs) provide capabilities far beyond sentence
completion, including question answering, summarization, and natural-language
inference. While many of these capabilities have potential application to
cognitive systems, our research is exploiting language models as a source of
task knowledge for cognitive agents, that is, agents realized via a cognitive
architecture. We identify challenges and opportunities for using language
models as an external knowledge source for cognitive systems and possible ways
to improve the effectiveness of knowledge extraction by integrating extraction
with cognitive architecture capabilities, highlighting with examples from our
recent work in this area.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question-answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM-based autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information establish reasoning chains and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this we introduce textscFinMem a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making. It encompasses three core modules Profiling to customize the agents characteristics; Memory with layered message processing to aid the agent in assimilating hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably textscFinMems memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge react agilely to new investment cues and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare textscFinMem with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks. We then fine-tuned the agents perceptual span and character setting to achieve a significantly enhanced trading performance. Collectively textscFinMem presents a cutting-edge LLM agent framework for automated trading boosting cumulative investment returns.

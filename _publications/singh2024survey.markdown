Text-to-SQL systems facilitate smooth interaction with databases by
translating natural language queries into Structured Query Language (SQL),
bridging the gap between non-technical users and complex database management
systems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of
AI-driven text-to-SQL systems, highlighting their foundational components,
advancements in large language model (LLM) architectures, and the critical role
of datasets such as Spider, WikiSQL, and CoSQL in driving progress. We examine
the applications of text-to-SQL in domains like healthcare, education, and
finance, emphasizing their transformative potential for improving data
accessibility. Additionally, we analyze persistent challenges, including domain
generalization, query optimization, support for multi-turn conversational
interactions, and the limited availability of datasets tailored for NoSQL
databases and dynamic real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we
outline future research directions, such as extending text-to-SQL capabilities
to support NoSQL databases, designing datasets for dynamic multi-turn
interactions, and optimizing systems for real-world scalability and robustness.
By surveying current advancements and identifying key gaps, this paper aims to
guide the next generation of research and applications in LLM-based text-to-SQL
systems.

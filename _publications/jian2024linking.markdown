Understanding the connections between artificial and biological intelligent systems can reveal fundamental principles underlying general intelligence. While many artificial intelligence (AI) models have a neuroscience counterpart such connections are largely missing in Transformer models and the self45;attention mechanism. Here we examine the relationship between attention heads and human episodic memory. We focus on the induction heads which contribute to the in45;context learning capabilities of Transformer45;based large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that induction heads are behaviorally functionally and mechanistically similar to the contextual maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model of human episodic memory. Our analyses of LLMs pre45;trained on extensive text data show that CMR45;like heads often emerge in the intermediate model layers and that their behavior qualitatively mirrors the memory biases seen in humans. Our findings uncover a parallel between the computational mechanisms of LLMs and human memory offering valuable insights into both research fields.

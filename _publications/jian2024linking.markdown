Understanding connections between artificial and biological intelligent
systems can reveal fundamental principles of general intelligence. While many
artificial intelligence models have a neuroscience counterpart, such
connections are largely missing in Transformer models and the self-attention
mechanism. Here, we examine the relationship between interacting attention
heads and human episodic memory. We focus on induction heads, which contribute
to in-context learning in Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). We
demonstrate that induction heads are behaviorally, functionally, and
mechanistically similar to the contextual maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model
of human episodic memory. Our analyses of LLMs pre-trained on extensive text
data show that CMR-like heads often emerge in the intermediate and late layers,
qualitatively mirroring human memory biases. The ablation of CMR-like heads
suggests their causal role in in-context learning. Our findings uncover a
parallel between the computational mechanisms of LLMs and human memory,
offering valuable insights into both research fields.

As labeling cost for different modules in task45;oriented dialog (ToD) systems is high a major challenge in practice is to learn different tasks with the least amount of labeled data. Recently prompting methods over pre45;trained language models (PLMs) have shown promising results for few45;shot learning in ToD. To better utilize the power of PLMs this paper proposes Comprehensive Instruction (CINS) that exploits PLMs with extra task45;specific instructions. We design a schema (definition constraint prompt) of instructions and their customized realizations for three important downstream tasks in ToD i.e. intent classification dialog state tracking and natural language generation. A sequence45;to45;sequence model (T5) is adopted to solve these three tasks in a unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on these ToD tasks in realistic few45;shot learning scenarios with small validation data. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed CINS approach consistently improves techniques that finetune PLMs with raw input or short prompts.

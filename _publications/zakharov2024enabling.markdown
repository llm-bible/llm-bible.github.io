Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents are transforming the programming
language landscape by facilitating learning for beginners, enabling code
generation, and optimizing documentation workflows. Hardware Description
Languages (HDLs), with their smaller user community, stand to benefit
significantly from the application of LLMs as tools for learning new HDLs. This
paper investigates the challenges and solutions of enabling LLMs for HDLs,
particularly for HDLs that LLMs have not been previously trained on. This work
introduces HDLAgent, an AI agent optimized for LLMs with limited knowledge of
various HDLs. It significantly enhances off-the-shelf LLMs.

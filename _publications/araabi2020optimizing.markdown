Language pairs with limited amounts of parallel data also known as low45;resource languages remain a challenge for neural machine translation. While the Transformer model has achieved significant improvements for many language pairs and has become the de facto mainstream architecture its capability under low45;resource conditions has not been fully investigated yet. Our experiments on different subsets of the IWSLT14 training data show that the effectiveness of Transformer under low45;resource conditions is highly dependent on the hyper45;parameter settings. Our experiments show that using an optimized Transformer for low45;resource conditions improves the translation quality up to 7.3 BLEU points compared to using the Transformer default settings.

This study comprehensively evaluates the translation quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) specifically GPT45;4 against human translators of varying expertise levels across multiple language pairs and domains. Through carefully designed annotation rounds we find that GPT45;4 performs comparably to junior translators in terms of total errors made but lags behind medium and senior translators. We also observe the imbalanced performance across different languages and domains with GPT45;4s translation capability gradually weakening from resource45;rich to resource45;poor directions. In addition we qualitatively study the translation given by GPT45;4 and human translators and find that GPT45;4 translator suffers from literal translations but human translators sometimes overthink the background information. To our knowledge this study is the first to evaluate LLMs against human translators and analyze the systematic differences between their outputs providing valuable insights into the current state of LLM45;based translation and its potential limitations.

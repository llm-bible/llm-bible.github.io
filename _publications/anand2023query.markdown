Querying conversing and controlling search and information-seeking interfaces using natural language are fast becoming ubiquitous with the rise and adoption of large-language models (LLM). In this position paper we describe a generic framework for interactive query-rewriting using LLMs. Our proposal aims to unfold new opportunities for improved and transparent intent understanding while building high-performance retrieval systems using LLMs. A key aspect of our framework is the ability of the rewriter to fully specify the machine intent by the search engine in natural language that can be further refined controlled and edited before the final retrieval phase. The ability to present interact and reason over the underlying machine intent in natural language has profound implications on transparency ranking performance and a departure from the traditional way in which supervised signals were collected for understanding intents. We detail the concept backed by initial experiments along with open questions for this interactive query understanding framework.

Gradient45;free prompt optimization methods have made significant strides in enhancing the performance of closed45;source Large Language Models (LLMs) across a wide range of tasks. However existing approaches make light of the importance of high45;quality prompt initialization and the identification of effective optimization directions thus resulting in substantial optimization steps to obtain satisfactory performance. In this light we aim to accelerate prompt optimization process to tackle the challenge of low convergence rate. We propose a dual45;phase approach which starts with generating high45;quality initial prompts by adopting a well45;designed meta45;instruction to delve into task45;specific information and iteratively optimize the prompts at the sentence level leveraging previous tuning experience to expand prompt candidates and accept effective ones. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method achieving a consistent accuracy gain over baselines with less than five optimization steps.

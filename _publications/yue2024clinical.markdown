Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have shown impressive
capabilities in natural language tasks but face challenges in clinical trial
applications, primarily due to limited access to external knowledge.
Recognizing the potential of advanced clinical trial tools that aggregate and
predict based on the latest medical data, we propose an integrated solution to
enhance their accessibility and utility. We introduce Clinical Agent System
(ClinicalAgent), a clinical multi-agent system designed for clinical trial
tasks, leveraging GPT-4, multi-agent architectures, LEAST-TO-MOST, and ReAct
reasoning technology. This integration not only boosts LLM performance in
clinical contexts but also introduces novel functionalities. The proposed
method achieves competitive predictive performance in clinical trial outcome
prediction (0.7908 PR-AUC), obtaining a 0.3326 improvement over the standard
prompt Method. Publicly available code can be found at

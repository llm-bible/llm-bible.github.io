This study presents a comparative evaluation of 22 large language models LLMs
on the Spanish Medical Intern Resident MIR examinations for 2024 and 2025 with
a focus on clinical reasoning domain specific expertise and multimodal
processing capabilities The MIR exam consisting of 210 multiple choice
questions some requiring image interpretation serves as a stringent benchmark
for assessing both factual recall and complex clinical problem solving skills
Our investigation encompasses general purpose models such as GPT4 Claude LLaMA
and Gemini as well as specialized fine tuned systems like Miri Pro which
leverages proprietary Spanish healthcare data to excel in medical contexts
  Recent market entries Deepseek and Grok have further enriched the evaluation
landscape particularly for tasks that demand advanced visual and semantic
analysis The findings indicate that while general purpose LLMs perform robustly
overall fine tuned models consistently achieve superior accuracy especially in
addressing nuanced domain specific challenges A modest performance decline
observed between the two exam cycles appears attributable to the implementation
of modified questions designed to mitigate reliance on memorization
  The results underscore the transformative potential of domain specific fine
tuning and multimodal integration in advancing medical AI applications They
also highlight critical implications for the future integration of LLMs into
medical education training and clinical decision making emphasizing the
importance of balancing automated reasoning with ethical and context aware
judgment

Designing dialog tutors has been challenging as it involves modeling the diverse and complex pedagogical strategies employed by human tutors. Although there have been significant recent advances in neural conversational systems using large language models (LLMs) and growth in available dialog corpora dialog tutoring has largely remained unaffected by these advances. In this paper we rigorously analyze various generative language models on two dialog tutoring datasets for language learning using automatic and human evaluations to understand the new opportunities brought by these advances as well as the challenges we must overcome to build models that would be usable in real educational settings. We find that although current approaches can model tutoring in constrained learning scenarios when the number of concepts to be taught and possible teacher strategies are small they perform poorly in less constrained scenarios. Our human quality evaluation shows that both models and ground45;truth annotations exhibit low performance in terms of equitable tutoring which measures learning opportunities for students and how engaging the dialog is. To understand the behavior of our models in a real tutoring setting we conduct a user study using expert annotators and find a significantly large number of model reasoning errors in 4537; of conversations. Finally we connect our findings to outline future work.

Text45;to45;image generation model is able to generate images across a diverse range of subjects and styles based on a single prompt. Recent works have proposed a variety of interaction methods that help users understand the capabilities of models and utilize them. However how to support users to efficiently explore the models capability and to create effective prompts are still open45;ended research questions. In this paper we present PromptCrafter a novel mixed45;initiative system that allows step45;by45;step crafting of text45;to45;image prompt. Through the iterative process users can efficiently explore the models capability and clarify their intent. PromptCrafter also supports users to refine prompts by answering various responses to clarifying questions generated by a Large Language Model. Lastly users can revert to a desired step by reviewing the work history. In this workshop paper we discuss the design process of PromptCrafter and our plans for follow45;up studies.

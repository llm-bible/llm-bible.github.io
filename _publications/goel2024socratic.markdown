Reframing a negative into a positive thought is at the crux of several
cognitive approaches to mental health and psychotherapy that could be made more
accessible by large language model-based solutions. Such reframing is typically
non-trivial and requires multiple rationalization steps to uncover the
underlying issue of a negative thought and transform it to be more positive.
However, this rationalization process is currently neglected by both datasets
and models which reframe thoughts in one step. In this work, we address this
gap by augmenting open-source datasets for positive text rewriting with
synthetically-generated Socratic rationales using a novel framework called
\textsc\{SocraticReframe\}. SocraticReframe uses a sequence of question-answer
pairs to rationalize the thought rewriting process. We show that such Socratic
rationales significantly improve positive text rewriting for different
open-source LLMs according to both automatic and human evaluations guided by
criteria from psychotherapy research. We validate our framework and the
synthetic rationalizations with expert judgements from domain experts and
psychology students in an IRB-approved annotation study. Our findings highlight
the potential of utilizing the synergy between LLM reasoning and established
psychotherapy techniques to build assistive solutions for reframing negative
thoughts.

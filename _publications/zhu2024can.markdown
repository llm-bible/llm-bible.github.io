Understanding context is key to understanding human language an ability which Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly seen to demonstrate to an impressive extent. However though the evaluation of LLMs encompasses various domains within the realm of Natural Language Processing limited attention has been paid to probing their linguistic capability of understanding contextual features. This paper introduces a context understanding benchmark by adapting existing datasets to suit the evaluation of generative models. This benchmark comprises of four distinct tasks and nine datasets all featuring prompts designed to assess the models ability to understand context. First we evaluate the performance of LLMs under the in45;context learning pretraining scenario. Experimental results indicate that pre45;trained dense models struggle with understanding more nuanced contextual features when compared to state45;of45;the45;art fine45;tuned models. Second as LLM compression holds growing significance in both research and real45;world applications we assess the context understanding of quantized models under in45;context45;learning settings. We find that 345;bit post45;training quantization leads to varying degrees of performance reduction on our benchmark. We conduct an extensive analysis of these scenarios to substantiate our experimental results.

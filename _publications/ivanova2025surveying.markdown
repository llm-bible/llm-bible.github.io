The rapid development of AI-driven tools, particularly large language models
(LLMs), is reshaping professional writing. Still, key aspects of their adoption
such as languages support, ethics, and long-term impact on writers voice and
creativity remain underexplored. In this work, we conducted a questionnaire (N
= 301) and an interactive survey (N = 36) targeting professional writers
regularly using AI. We examined LLM-assisted writing practices across 25+
languages, ethical concerns, and user expectations. The findings of the survey
demonstrate important insights, reflecting upon the importance of: LLMs
adoption for non-English speakers; the degree of misinformation, domain and
style adaptation; usability and key features of LLMs. These insights can guide
further development, benefiting both writers and a broader user base.

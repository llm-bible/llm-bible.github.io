Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance by following natural language instructions without fine45;tuning them on domain45;specific tasks and data. However leveraging LLMs for domain45;specific question answering suffers from severe limitations. The generated answer tends to hallucinate due to the training data collection time (when using off45;the45;shelf) complex user utterance and wrong retrieval (in retrieval45;augmented generation). Furthermore due to the lack of awareness about the domain and expected output such LLMs may generate unexpected and unsafe answers that are not tailored to the target domain. In this paper we propose CarExpert an in45;car retrieval45;augmented conversational question45;answering system leveraging LLMs for different tasks. Specifically CarExpert employs LLMs to control the input provide domain45;specific documents to the extractive and generative answering components and controls the output to ensure safe and domain45;specific answers. A comprehensive empirical evaluation exhibits that CarExpert outperforms state45;of45;the45;art LLMs in generating natural safe and car45;specific answers.

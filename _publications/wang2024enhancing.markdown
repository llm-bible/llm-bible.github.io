Large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering hold significant potential for advancing computer programming education through personalized instruction. This paper explores this potential by investigating three critical research questions the systematic categorization of prompt engineering strategies tailored to diverse educational needs the empowerment of LLMs to solve complex problems beyond their inherent capabilities and the establishment of a robust framework for evaluating and implementing these strategies. Our methodology involves categorizing programming questions based on educational requirements applying various prompt engineering strategies and assessing the effectiveness of LLM-generated responses. Experiments with GPT-4 GPT-4o Llama3-8b and Mixtral-8x7b models on datasets such as LeetCode and USACO reveal that GPT-4o consistently outperforms others particularly with the multi-step prompt strategy. The results show that tailored prompt strategies significantly enhance LLM performance with specific strategies recommended for foundational learning competition preparation and advanced problem-solving. This study underscores the crucial role of prompt engineering in maximizing the educational benefits of LLMs. By systematically categorizing and testing these strategies we provide a comprehensive framework for both educators and students to optimize LLM-based learning experiences. Future research should focus on refining these strategies and addressing current LLM limitations to further enhance educational outcomes in computer programming instruction.

Embeddings extracted by pre45;trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have significant potential to improve information retrieval and search. Beyond the zero45;shot setup in which they are being conventionally used being able to take advantage of the information from the relevant query45;corpus paired data can further boost the LLM capabilities. In this paper we propose a novel method Search45;Adaptor for customizing LLMs for information retrieval in an efficient and robust way. Search45;Adaptor modifies the embeddings generated by pre45;trained LLMs and can be integrated with any LLM including those only available via prediction APIs. On multiple English multilingual and multimodal retrieval datasets we show consistent and significant performance benefits for Search45;Adaptor 45;45; e.g. more than 537; improvements for Google Embedding APIs in nDCG35;64;10 averaged over 14 BEIR datasets.

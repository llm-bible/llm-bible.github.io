GPT-3 and several other language models (LMs) can effectively address various natural language processing (NLP) tasks including machine translation and text summarization. Recently they have also been successfully employed in the business process management (BPM) domain e.g. for predictive process monitoring and process extraction from text. This however typically requires fine-tuning the employed LM which among others necessitates large amounts of suitable training data. A possible solution to this problem is the use of prompt engineering which leverages pre-trained LMs without fine-tuning them. Recognizing this we argue that prompt engineering can help bring the capabilities of LMs to BPM research. We use this position paper to develop a research agenda for the use of prompt engineering for BPM research by identifying the associated potentials and challenges.

Using proprietary Large Language Models on legal tasks poses challenges due to data privacy issues domain data heterogeneity domain knowledge sophistication and domain objectives uniqueness. We created Aalalp a fine-tuned Mistral 7B model on instructions data related to specific Indian legal tasks. The performance of Aalap is better than gpt-3.5-turbo in 3137; of our test data and obtains an equivalent score in 3437; of the test data as evaluated by GPT4. Training Aalap mainly focuses on teaching legal reasoning rather than legal recall. Aalap is definitely helpful for the day-to-day activities of lawyers judges or anyone working in legal systems.

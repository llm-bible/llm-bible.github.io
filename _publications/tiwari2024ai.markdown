Using proprietary Large Language Models on legal tasks poses challenges due
to data privacy issues, domain data heterogeneity, domain knowledge
sophistication, and domain objectives uniqueness. We created Aalalp, a
fine-tuned Mistral 7B model on instructions data related to specific Indian
legal tasks. The performance of Aalap is better than gpt-3.5-turbo in 31% of
our test data and obtains an equivalent score in 34% of the test data as
evaluated by GPT4. Training Aalap mainly focuses on teaching legal reasoning
rather than legal recall. Aalap is definitely helpful for the day-to-day
activities of lawyers, judges, or anyone working in legal systems.

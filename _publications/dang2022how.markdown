Deep generative models have the potential to fundamentally change the way we
create high-fidelity digital content but are often hard to control. Prompting a
generative model is a promising recent development that in principle enables
end-users to creatively leverage zero-shot and few-shot learning to assign new
tasks to an AI ad-hoc, simply by writing them down. However, for the majority
of end-users writing effective prompts is currently largely a trial and error
process. To address this, we discuss the key opportunities and challenges for
interactive creative applications that use prompting as a new paradigm for
Human-AI interaction. Based on our analysis, we propose four design goals for
user interfaces that support prompting. We illustrate these with concrete UI
design sketches, focusing on the use case of creative writing. The research
community in HCI and AI can take these as starting points to develop adequate
user interfaces for models capable of zero- and few-shot learning.

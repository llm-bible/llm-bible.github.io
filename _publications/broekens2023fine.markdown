Large language models in particular generative pre45;trained transformers (GPTs) show impressive results on a wide variety of language45;related tasks. In this paper we explore ChatGPTs zero45;shot ability to perform affective computing tasks using prompting alone. We show that ChatGPT a) performs meaningful sentiment analysis in the Valence Arousal and Dominance dimensions b) has meaningful emotion representations in terms of emotion categories and these affective dimensions and c) can perform basic appraisal45;based emotion elicitation of situations based on a prompt45;based computational implementation of the OCC appraisal model. These findings are highly relevant First they show that the ability to solve complex affect processing tasks emerges from language45;based token prediction trained on extensive data sets. Second they show the potential of large language models for simulating processing and analyzing human emotions which has important implications for various applications such as sentiment analysis socially interactive agents and social robotics.

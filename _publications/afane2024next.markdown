The escalating threat of phishing emails has become increasingly
sophisticated with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). As attackers
exploit LLMs to craft more convincing and evasive phishing emails, it is
crucial to assess the resilience of current phishing defenses. In this study we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of traditional phishing detectors, such as
Gmail Spam Filter, Apache SpamAssassin, and Proofpoint, as well as machine
learning models like SVM, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes, in identifying
both traditional and LLM-rephrased phishing emails. We also explore the
emerging role of LLMs as phishing detection tools, a method already adopted by
companies like NTT Security Holdings and JPMorgan Chase. Our results reveal
notable declines in detection accuracy for rephrased emails across all
detectors, highlighting critical weaknesses in current phishing defenses. As
the threat landscape evolves, our findings underscore the need for stronger
security controls and regulatory oversight on LLM-generated content to prevent
its misuse in creating advanced phishing attacks. This study contributes to the
development of more effective Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) by leveraging
LLMs to generate diverse phishing variants that can be used for data
augmentation, harnessing the power of LLMs to enhance phishing detection, and
paving the way for more robust and adaptable threat detection systems.

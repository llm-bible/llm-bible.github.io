Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential for assisting developers in their daily development. However most research focuses on generating correct code how to use LLMs to generate personalized code has seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap we proposed MPCoder (Multi-user Personalized Code Generator) to generate personalized code for multiple users. To better learn coding style features we utilize explicit coding style residual learning to capture the syntax code style standards and implicit style learning to capture the semantic code style conventions. We train a multi-user style adapter to better differentiate the implicit feature representations of different users through contrastive learning ultimately enabling personalized code generation for multiple users. We further propose a novel evaluation metric for estimating similarities between codes of different coding styles. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach for this novel task.

Larger language models such as GPT45;3 have shown to be excellent in many tasks. However we demonstrate that out45;of45;ordinary questions can throw the model off guard. This work focuses on finding answers to negated complementary questions in commonsense scenarios. We illustrate how such questions adversely affect the model responses. We propose a model45;agnostic methodology to improve the performance in negated complementary scenarios. Our method outperforms few45;shot generation from GPT45;3 (by more than 11 points) and more importantly highlights the significance of studying the response of large language models in negated complementary questions. The code data and experiments are available under https://github.com/navidre/negated&#95;complementary&#95;commonsense.

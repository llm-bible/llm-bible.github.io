Translating knowledge-intensive and entity-rich text between English and
Korean requires transcreation to preserve language-specific and cultural
nuances beyond literal, phonetic or word-for-word conversion. We evaluate 13
models (LLMs and MT models) using automatic metrics and human assessment by
bilingual annotators. Our findings show LLMs outperform traditional MT systems
but struggle with entity translation requiring cultural adaptation. By
constructing an error taxonomy, we identify incorrect responses and entity name
errors as key issues, with performance varying by entity type and popularity
level. This work exposes gaps in automatic evaluation metrics and hope to
enable future work in completing culturally-nuanced machine translation.

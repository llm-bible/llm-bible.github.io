Reasoning methods best exemplified by the well45;known Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) empower the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by eliciting them to solve complex tasks in a step45;by45;step manner. Although they are achieving significant success the ability to deliver multi45;step reasoning remains limited to English because of the imbalance in the distribution of pre45;training data which makes other languages a barrier. In this paper we propose Cross45;lingual Tree45;of45;Thoughts (Cross45;ToT) a method for aligning Cross45;lingual CoT reasoning across languages. The proposed method through a self45;consistent cross45;lingual prompting mechanism inspired by the Tree45;of45;Thoughts approach provides multi45;step reasoning paths in different languages that during the steps lead to the final solution. Experimental evaluations show that our method significantly outperforms existing prompting methods by reducing the number of interactions and achieving state45;of45;the45;art performance.

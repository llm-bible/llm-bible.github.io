Achieving universal translation between all human language pairs is the holy45;grail of machine translation (MT) research. While recent progress in massively multilingual MT is one step closer to reaching this goal it is becoming evident that extending a multilingual MT system simply by training on more parallel data is unscalable since the availability of labeled data for low45;resource and non45;English45;centric language pairs is forbiddingly limited. To this end we present a pragmatic approach towards building a multilingual MT model that covers hundreds of languages using a mixture of supervised and self45;supervised objectives depending on the data availability for different language pairs. We demonstrate that the synergy between these two training paradigms enables the model to produce high45;quality translations in the zero45;resource setting even surpassing supervised translation quality for low45; and mid45;resource languages. We conduct a wide array of experiments to understand the effect of the degree of multilingual supervision domain mismatches and amounts of parallel and monolingual data on the quality of our self45;supervised multilingual models. To demonstrate the scalability of the approach we train models with over 200 languages and demonstrate high performance on zero45;resource translation on several previously under45;studied languages. We hope our findings will serve as a stepping stone towards enabling translation for the next thousand languages.

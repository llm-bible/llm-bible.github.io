Large language models (LLMs) have enhanced the capacity of vision-language models to caption visual text. This generative approach to image caption enrichment further makes textual captions more descriptive improving alignment with the visual context. However while many studies focus on benefits of generative caption enrichment (GCE) are there any negative side effects We compare standard-format captions and recent GCE processes from the perspectives of gender bias and hallucination showing that enriched captions suffer from increased gender bias and hallucination. Furthermore models trained on these enriched captions amplify gender bias by an average of 30.937; and increase hallucination by 59.537;. This study serves as a caution against the trend of making captions more descriptive.

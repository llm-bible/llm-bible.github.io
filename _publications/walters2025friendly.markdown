AI Agent, powered by large language models (LLMs) as its cognitive core, is
an intelligent agentic system capable of autonomously controlling and
determining the execution paths under user's instructions. With the burst of
capabilities of LLMs and various plugins, such as RAG, text-to-image/video/3D,
etc., the potential of AI Agents has been vastly expanded, with their
capabilities growing stronger by the day. However, at the intersection between
AI and web3, there is currently no ideal agentic framework that can seamlessly
integrate web3 applications into AI agent functionalities. In this paper, we
propose Eliza, the first open-source web3-friendly Agentic framework that makes
the deployment of web3 applications effortless. We emphasize that every aspect
of Eliza is a regular Typescript program under the full control of its user,
and it seamlessly integrates with web3 (i.e., reading and writing blockchain
data, interacting with smart contracts, etc.). Furthermore, we show how stable
performance is achieved through the pragmatic implementation of the key
components of Eliza's runtime. Our code is publicly available at

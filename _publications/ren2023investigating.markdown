Knowledge45;intensive tasks (e.g. open45;domain question answering (QA)) require a substantial amount of factual knowledge and often rely on external information for assistance. Recently large language models (LLMs) (e.g. ChatGPT) have demonstrated impressive prowess in solving a wide range of tasks with world knowledge including knowledge45;intensive tasks. However it remains unclear how well LLMs are able to perceive their factual knowledge boundaries particularly how they behave when incorporating retrieval augmentation. In this study we present an initial analysis of the factual knowledge boundaries of LLMs and how retrieval augmentation affects LLMs on open45;domain QA. Specially we focus on three primary research questions and analyze them by examining QA performance priori judgement and posteriori judgement of LLMs. We show evidence that LLMs possess unwavering confidence in their capabilities to respond to questions and the accuracy of their responses. Furthermore retrieval augmentation proves to be an effective approach in enhancing LLMs awareness of knowledge boundaries thereby improving their judgemental abilities. Additionally we also find that LLMs have a propensity to rely on the provided retrieval results when formulating answers while the quality of these results significantly impacts their reliance.

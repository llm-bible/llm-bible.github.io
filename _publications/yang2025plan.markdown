Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in answering
questions across various domains, but they often encounter hallucination issues
on questions that require professional and up-to-date knowledge. To address
this limitation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have been
proposed, which retrieve relevant information from external sources to inform
their responses. However, existing RAG methods typically focus on a single type
of external data, such as vectorized text database or knowledge graphs, and
cannot well handle real-world questions on semi-structured data containing both
text and relational information. To bridge this gap, we introduce PASemiQA, a
novel approach that jointly leverages text and relational information in
semi-structured data to answer questions. PASemiQA first generates a plan to
identify relevant text and relational information to answer the question in
semi-structured data, and then uses an LLM agent to traverse the
semi-structured data and extract necessary information. Our empirical results
demonstrate the effectiveness of PASemiQA across different semi-structured
datasets from various domains, showcasing its potential to improve the accuracy
and reliability of question answering systems on semi-structured data.

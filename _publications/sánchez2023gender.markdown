While machine translation (MT) systems have seen significant improvements it is still common for translations to reflect societal biases such as gender bias. Decoder45;only Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in MT albeit with performance slightly lagging behind traditional encoder45;decoder Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems. However LLMs offer a unique advantage the ability to control the properties of the output through prompts. In this study we leverage this flexibility to explore LLaMas capability to produce gender45;specific translations. Our results indicate that LLaMa can generate gender45;specific translations with translation accuracy and gender bias comparable to NLLB a state45;of45;the45;art multilingual NMT system. Furthermore our experiments reveal that LLaMas gender45;specific translations rely on coreference resolution to determine gender showing higher gender variance in gender45;ambiguous datasets but maintaining consistency in less ambiguous contexts. This research investigates the potential and challenges of using LLMs for gender45;specific translations as an instance of the controllability of outputs offered by LLMs.

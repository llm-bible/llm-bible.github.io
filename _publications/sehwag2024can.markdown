Despite the importance of developing generative AI models that can
effectively resist scams, current literature lacks a structured framework for
evaluating their vulnerability to such threats. In this work, we address this
gap by constructing a benchmark based on the FINRA taxonomy and systematically
assessing Large Language Models' (LLMs') vulnerability to a variety of scam
tactics. First, we incorporate 37 well-defined base scam scenarios reflecting
the diverse scam categories identified by FINRA taxonomy, providing a focused
evaluation of LLMs' scam detection capabilities. Second, we utilize
representative proprietary (GPT-3.5, GPT-4) and open-source (Llama) models to
analyze their performance in scam detection. Third, our research provides
critical insights into which scam tactics are most effective against LLMs and
how varying persona traits and persuasive techniques influence these
vulnerabilities. We reveal distinct susceptibility patterns across different
models and scenarios, underscoring the need for targeted enhancements in LLM
design and deployment.

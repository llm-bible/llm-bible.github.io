Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can provide personalized and self-paced learning experience. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) further enables better human-machine interaction and facilitates the development of conversational ITSs in various disciplines such as math and language learning. In dialogic teaching recognizing and adapting to individual characteristics can significantly enhance student engagement and learning efficiency. However characterizing and simulating students persona remain challenging in training and evaluating conversational ITSs. In this work we propose a framework to construct profiles of different student groups by refining and integrating both cognitive and noncognitive aspects and leverage LLMs for personality-aware student simulation in a language learning scenario. We further enhance the framework with multi-aspect validation and conduct extensive analysis from both teacher and student perspectives. Our experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can produce diverse student responses according to the given language ability and personality traits and trigger teachers adaptive scaffolding strategies.

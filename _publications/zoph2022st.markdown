Scale has opened new frontiers in natural language processing -- but at a high cost. In response Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) and Switch Transformers have been proposed as an energy efficient path to even larger and more capable language models. But advancing the state-of-the-art across a broad set of natural language tasks has been hindered by training instabilities and uncertain quality during fine-tuning. Our work focuses on these issues and acts as a design guide. We conclude by scaling a sparse model to 269B parameters with a computational cost comparable to a 32B dense encoder-decoder Transformer (Stable and Transferable Mixture-of-Experts or ST-MoE-32B). For the first time a sparse model achieves state-of-the-art performance in transfer learning across a diverse set of tasks including reasoning (SuperGLUE ARC Easy ARC Challenge) summarization (XSum CNN-DM) closed book question answering (WebQA Natural Questions) and adversarially constructed tasks (Winogrande ANLI R3).

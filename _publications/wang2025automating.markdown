Modern recommender systems increasingly leverage large language models (LLMs)
for reranking to improve personalization. However, existing approaches face two
key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on manually crafted prompts that are
difficult to scale, and (2) inadequate handling of unstructured item metadata
that complicates preference inference. We present AGP (Auto-Guided Prompt
Refinement), a novel framework that automatically optimizes user profile
generation prompts for personalized reranking. AGP introduces two key
innovations: (1) position-aware feedback mechanisms for precise ranking
correction, and (2) batched training with aggregated feedback to enhance
generalization.

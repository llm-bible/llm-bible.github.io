Large Language Models (LLMs) are so powerful that they sometimes learn correlations between labels and features that are irrelevant to the task leading to poor generalization on out-of-distribution data. We propose explanation-based finetuning as a general approach to mitigate LLMs reliance on spurious correlations. Unlike standard finetuning where the model only predicts the answer given the input we finetune the model to additionally generate a free-text explanation supporting its answer. To evaluate our method we finetune the model on artificially constructed training sets containing different types of spurious cues and test it on a test set without these cues. Compared to standard finetuning our method makes GPT-3 (davinci) remarkably more robust against spurious cues in terms of accuracy drop across four classification tasks ComVE (+1.2) CREAK (+9.1) e-SNLI (+15.4) and SBIC (+6.5). The efficacy generalizes across multiple model families and scales with greater gains for larger models. Finally our method also works well with explanations generated by the model implying its applicability to more datasets without human-written explanations.

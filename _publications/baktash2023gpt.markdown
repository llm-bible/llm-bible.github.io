Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is the fourth-generation language model in the GPT series developed by OpenAI which promises significant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In this research article we have discussed the features of GPT-4 its potential applications and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared GPT-4 with its predecessor GPT-3. GPT-4 has a larger model size (more than one trillion) better multilingual capabilities improved contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities than GPT-3. Some of the potential applications of GPT-4 include chatbots personal assistants language translation text summarization and question-answering. However GPT-4 poses several challenges and limitations such as computational requirements data requirements and ethical concerns.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is the fourth-generation
language model in the GPT series, developed by OpenAI, which promises
significant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In
this research article, we have discussed the features of GPT-4, its potential
applications, and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared
GPT-4 with its predecessor, GPT-3. GPT-4 has a larger model size (more than one
trillion), better multilingual capabilities, improved contextual understanding,
and reasoning capabilities than GPT-3. Some of the potential applications of
GPT-4 include chatbots, personal assistants, language translation, text
summarization, and question-answering. However, GPT-4 poses several challenges
and limitations such as computational requirements, data requirements, and
ethical concerns.

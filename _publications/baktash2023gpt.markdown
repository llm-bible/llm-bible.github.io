Generative Pre45;trained Transformer 4 (GPT45;4) is the fourth45;generation language model in the GPT series developed by OpenAI which promises significant advancements in the field of natural language processing (NLP). In this research article we have discussed the features of GPT45;4 its potential applications and the challenges that it might face. We have also compared GPT45;4 with its predecessor GPT45;3. GPT45;4 has a larger model size (more than one trillion) better multilingual capabilities improved contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities than GPT45;3. Some of the potential applications of GPT45;4 include chatbots personal assistants language translation text summarization and question45;answering. However GPT45;4 poses several challenges and limitations such as computational requirements data requirements and ethical concerns.

SpeechBrain is an open-source Conversational AI toolkit based on PyTorch,
focused particularly on speech processing tasks such as speech recognition,
speech enhancement, speaker recognition, text-to-speech, and much more. It
promotes transparency and replicability by releasing both the pre-trained
models and the complete "recipes" of code and algorithms required for training
them. This paper presents SpeechBrain 1.0, a significant milestone in the
evolution of the toolkit, which now has over 200 recipes for speech, audio, and
language processing tasks, and more than 100 models available on Hugging Face.
SpeechBrain 1.0 introduces new technologies to support diverse learning
modalities, Large Language Model (LLM) integration, and advanced decoding
strategies, along with novel models, tasks, and modalities. It also includes a
new benchmark repository, offering researchers a unified platform for
evaluating models across diverse tasks.

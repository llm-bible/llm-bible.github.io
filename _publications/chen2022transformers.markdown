We consider the end-to-end abstract-to-title generation problem exploring seven recent transformer based models (including ChatGPT) fine-tuned on more than 30k abstract-title pairs from NLP and machine learning (ML) venues. As an extension we also consider the harder problem of generating humorous paper titles. For the latter we compile the first large-scale humor annotated dataset for scientific papers in the NLP/ML domains comprising almost ~2.6k titles. We evaluate all models using human and automatic metrics. Our human evaluation suggests that our best end-to-end system performs similarly to human authors (but arguably slightly worse). Generating funny titles is more difficult however and our automatic systems clearly underperform relative to humans and often learn dataset artefacts of humor. Finally ChatGPT without any fine-tuning performs on the level of our best fine-tuned system.

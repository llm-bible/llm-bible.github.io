The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized
educational technology, enabling innovative approaches to automated and
personalized content creation. This paper introduces Slide2Text, a system that
leverages LLMs to transform PowerPoint presentations into customized textbooks.
By extracting slide content using OCR, organizing it into a coherent structure,
and generating tailored materials such as explanations, exercises, and
references, Slide2Text streamlines the textbook creation process. Flexible
customization options further enhance its adaptability to diverse educational
needs. The system highlights the potential of LLMs in modernizing textbook
creation and improving educational accessibility. Future developments will
explore multimedia inputs and advanced user customization features.

In the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) accurately discerning commander intent and executing linguistic commands within a visual context presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder45;decoder framework developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context45;Aware Visual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core encoders45;Text Image Context and Cross45;Modal45;with a Multimodal decoder. This integration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and to learn human emotional features augmented by state45;of45;the45;art Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT45;4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the implementation of multi45;head cross45;modal attention mechanisms and a Region45;Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This architectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a range of cross45;modal inputs yielding a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical evaluations on the Talk2Car dataset a real45;world benchmark demonstrate that CAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational efficiency. Notably the model exhibits exceptional performance even with limited training data ranging from 5037; to 7537; of the full dataset. This feature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical AV applications. Moreover CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios including long45;text command interpretation low45;light conditions ambiguous command contexts inclement weather conditions and densely populated urban environments. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.

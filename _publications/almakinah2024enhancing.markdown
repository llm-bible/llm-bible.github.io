Access to mental health support remains limited, particularly in marginalized
communities where structural and cultural barriers hinder timely care. This
paper explores the potential of AI-enabled chatbots as a scalable solution,
focusing on advanced large language models (LLMs)-GPT v4, Mistral Large, and
LLama V3.1-and assessing their ability to deliver empathetic, meaningful
responses in mental health contexts. While these models show promise in
generating structured responses, they fall short in replicating the emotional
depth and adaptability of human therapists. Additionally, trustworthiness,
bias, and privacy challenges persist due to unreliable datasets and limited
collaboration with mental health professionals. To address these limitations,
we propose a federated learning framework that ensures data privacy, reduces
bias, and integrates continuous validation from clinicians to enhance response
quality. This approach aims to develop a secure, evidence-based AI chatbot
capable of offering trustworthy, empathetic, and bias-reduced mental health
support, advancing AI's role in digital mental health care.

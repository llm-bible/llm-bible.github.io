Automatically generating data visualizations in response to human utterances on datasets necessitates a deep semantic understanding of the data utterance including implicit and explicit references to data attributes visualization tasks and necessary data preparation steps. Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) for data visualization have explored ways to infer such information yet challenges persist due to inherent uncertainty in human speech. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) provide an avenue to address these challenges but their ability to extract the relevant semantic information remains unexplored. In this study we evaluate four publicly available LLMs (GPT-4 Gemini-Pro Llama3 and Mixtral) investigating their ability to comprehend utterances even in the presence of uncertainty and identify the relevant data context and visual tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs are sensitive to uncertainties in utterances. Despite this sensitivity they are able to extract the relevant data context. However LLMs struggle with inferring visualization tasks. Based on these results we highlight future research directions on using LLMs for visualization generation.

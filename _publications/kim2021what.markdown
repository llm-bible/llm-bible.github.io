GPT45;3 shows remarkable in45;context learning ability of large45;scale language models (LMs) trained on hundreds of billion scale data. Here we address some remaining issues less reported by the GPT45;3 paper such as a non45;English LM the performances of different sized models and the effect of recently introduced prompt optimization on in45;context learning. To achieve this we introduce HyperCLOVA a Korean variant of 82B GPT45;3 trained on a Korean45;centric corpus of 560B tokens. Enhanced by our Korean45;specific tokenization HyperCLOVA with our training configuration shows state45;of45;the45;art in45;context zero45;shot and few45;shot learning performances on various downstream tasks in Korean. Also we show the performance benefits of prompt45;based learning and demonstrate how it can be integrated into the prompt engineering pipeline. Then we discuss the possibility of materializing the No Code AI paradigm by providing AI prototyping capabilities to non45;experts of ML by introducing HyperCLOVA studio an interactive prompt engineering interface. Lastly we demonstrate the potential of our methods with three successful in45;house applications.

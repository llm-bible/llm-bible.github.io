The ubiquity and widespread use of digital and online technologies have
transformed mental health support, with online mental health communities
(OMHCs) providing safe spaces for peer support. More recently, generative AI
and large language models (LLMs) have introduced new possibilities for
scalable, around-the-clock mental health assistance that could potentially
augment and supplement the capabilities of OMHCs. Although genAI shows promise
in delivering immediate and personalized responses, their effectiveness in
replicating the nuanced, experience-based support of human peers remains an
open question. In this study, we harnessed 24,114 posts and 138,758 online
community (OC) responses from 55 OMHCs on Reddit. We prompted several
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3, and Mistral-7B) with these posts,
and compared their (AI) responses to human-written (OC) responses based on a
variety of linguistic measures across psycholinguistics and lexico-semantics.
Our findings revealed that AI responses are more verbose, readable, and
analytically structured, but lack linguistic diversity and personal narratives
inherent in human-human interactions. Through a qualitative examination, we
found validation as well as complementary insights into the nature of AI
responses, such as its neutrality of stance and the absence of seeking
back-and-forth clarifications. We discuss the ethical and practical
implications of integrating generative AI into OMHCs, advocating for frameworks
that balance AI's scalability and timeliness with the irreplaceable
authenticity, social interactiveness, and expertise of human connections that
form the ethos of online support communities.

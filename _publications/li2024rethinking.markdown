Over the last decade a wide range of training and deployment strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged. Among these the prompting paradigms of Auto45;regressive LLMs (AR45;LLMs) have catalyzed a significant surge in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This paper aims to emphasize the significance of utilizing free45;form modalities (forms of input and output) and verbal free45;form contexts as user45;directed channels (methods for transforming modalities) for downstream deployment. Specifically we analyze the structure of modalities within both two types of LLMs and six task45;specific channels during deployment. From the perspective of users our analysis introduces and applies the analytical metrics of task customizability transparency and complexity to gauge their usability highlighting the superior nature of AR45;LLMs prompting paradigms. Moreover we examine the stimulation of diverse cognitive behaviors in LLMs through the adoption of free45;form text and verbal contexts mirroring human linguistic expressions of such behaviors. We then detail four common cognitive behaviors to underscore how AR45;LLMs prompting successfully imitate human45;like behaviors using this free45;form modality and channel. Lastly the potential for improving LLM deployment both as autonomous agents and within multi45;agent systems is identified via cognitive behavior concepts and principles.

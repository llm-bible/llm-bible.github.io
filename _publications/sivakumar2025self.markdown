This paper introduces a self-learning agent that integrates LLaMA 3.2 with a
Progressive Neural Network (PNN) for continual learning in conversational AI
and code generation. The framework dynamically collects data, fine-tunes tasks
with minimal samples, and leverages Meta-Learning for rapid adaptation. LoRA
optimizes fine-tuning, while Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) enhances
knowledge retention. Experimental results demonstrate improved adaptability and
memory stability, positioning this approach as a scalable step toward
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

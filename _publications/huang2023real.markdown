We introduce a novel method for real-time animation control and generation on rigged models using natural language input. First we embed a large language model (LLM) in Unity to output structured texts that can be parsed into diverse and realistic animations. Second we illustrate LLMs potential to enable flexible state transition between existing animations. We showcase the robustness of our approach through qualitative results on various rigged models and motions.

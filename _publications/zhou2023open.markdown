Recent advances on large language models (LLMs) enable researchers and
developers to build autonomous language agents that can automatically solve
various tasks and interact with environments, humans, and other agents using
natural language interfaces. We consider language agents as a promising
direction towards artificial general intelligence and release Agents, an
open-source library with the goal of opening up these advances to a wider
non-specialist audience. Agents is carefully engineered to support important
features including planning, memory, tool usage, multi-agent communication, and
fine-grained symbolic control. Agents is user-friendly as it enables
non-specialists to build, customize, test, tune, and deploy state-of-the-art
autonomous language agents without much coding. The library is also
research-friendly as its modularized design makes it easily extensible for
researchers. Agents is available at https://github.com/aiwaves-cn/agents.

Recent advances in instruction45;following large language models (LLMs) have led to dramatic improvements in a range of NLP tasks. Unfortunately we find that the same improved capabilities amplify the dual45;use risks for malicious purposes of these models. Dual45;use is difficult to prevent as instruction45;following capabilities now enable standard attacks from computer security. The capabilities of these instruction45;following LLMs provide strong economic incentives for dual45;use by malicious actors. In particular we show that instruction45;following LLMs can produce targeted malicious content including hate speech and scams bypassing in45;the45;wild defenses implemented by LLM API vendors. Our analysis shows that this content can be generated economically and at cost likely lower than with human effort alone. Together our findings suggest that LLMs will increasingly attract more sophisticated adversaries and attacks and addressing these attacks may require new approaches to mitigations.

Developing mechanisms that flexibly adapt dialog systems to unseen tasks and domains is a major challenge in dialog research. Neural models implicitly memorize task45;specific dialog policies from the training data. We posit that this implicit memorization has precluded zero45;shot transfer learning. To this end we leverage the schema45;guided paradigm wherein the task45;specific dialog policy is explicitly provided to the model. We introduce the Schema Attention Model (SAM) and improved schema representations for the STAR corpus. SAM obtains significant improvement in zero45;shot settings with a +22 F1 score improvement over prior work. These results validate the feasibility of zero45;shot generalizability in dialog. Ablation experiments are also presented to demonstrate the efficacy of SAM.

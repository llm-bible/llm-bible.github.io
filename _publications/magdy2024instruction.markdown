Writing has long been considered a hallmark of human intelligence and remains
a pinnacle task for artificial intelligence (AI) due to the intricate cognitive
processes involved. Recently, rapid advancements in generative AI, particularly
through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), have significantly
transformed the landscape of writing assistance. However, underrepresented
languages like Arabic encounter significant challenges in the development of
advanced AI writing tools, largely due to the limited availability of data.
This scarcity constrains the training of effective models, impeding the
creation of sophisticated writing assistance technologies. To address these
issues, we present Gazelle, a comprehensive dataset for Arabic writing
assistance. In addition, we offer an evaluation framework designed to enhance
Arabic writing assistance tools. Our human evaluation of leading LLMs,
including GPT-4, GPT-4o, Cohere Command R+, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, highlights
their respective strengths and limitations in addressing the challenges of
Arabic writing. Our findings underscore the need for continuous model training
and dataset enrichment to manage the complexities of Arabic language
processing, paving the way for more effective AI-powered Arabic writing tools.

Large language model (LLM) agents have evolved to intelligently process
information, make decisions, and interact with users or tools. A key capability
is the integration of long-term memory capabilities, enabling these agents to
draw upon historical interactions and knowledge. However, the growing memory
size and need for semantic structuring pose significant challenges. In this
work, we propose an autonomous memory augmentation approach, MemInsight, to
enhance semantic data representation and retrieval mechanisms. By leveraging
autonomous augmentation to historical interactions, LLM agents are shown to
deliver more accurate and contextualized responses. We empirically validate the
efficacy of our proposed approach in three task scenarios; conversational
recommendation, question answering and event summarization. On the LLM-REDIAL
dataset, MemInsight boosts persuasiveness of recommendations by up to 14%.
Moreover, it outperforms a RAG baseline by 34% in recall for LoCoMo retrieval.
Our empirical results show the potential of MemInsight to enhance the
contextual performance of LLM agents across multiple tasks.

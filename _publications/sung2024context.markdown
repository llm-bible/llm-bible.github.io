Translating conversational text, particularly in customer support contexts,
presents unique challenges due to its informal and unstructured nature. We
propose a context-aware LLM translation system that leverages conversation
summarization and dialogue history to enhance translation quality for the
English-Korean language pair. Our approach incorporates the two most recent
dialogues as raw data and a summary of earlier conversations to manage context
length effectively. We demonstrate that this method significantly improves
translation accuracy, maintaining coherence and consistency across
conversations. This system offers a practical solution for customer support
translation tasks, addressing the complexities of conversational text.

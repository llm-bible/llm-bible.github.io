There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains. The most common methods are prompting finetuning and RAG. In this work we explore the possibility of adapting a model using one of the PEFT methods - QLoRA. The experiment aims to simulate human responses based on their interviews. The simulation quality is assessed by comparing the quality of the style and the quality of the generated facts.

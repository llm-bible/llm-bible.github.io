The goal of conversational product search (CPS) is to develop an intelligent,
chat-based shopping assistant that can directly interact with customers to
understand shopping intents, ask clarification questions, and find relevant
products. However, training such assistants is hindered mainly due to the lack
of reliable and large-scale datasets. Prior human-annotated CPS datasets are
extremely small in size and lack integration with real-world product search
systems. We propose a novel approach, TRACER, which leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate realistic and natural conversations for different
shopping domains. TRACER's novelty lies in grounding the generation to dialogue
plans, which are product search trajectories predicted from a decision tree
model, that guarantees relevant product discovery in the shortest number of
search conditions. We also release the first target-oriented CPS dataset Wizard
of Shopping (WoS), containing highly natural and coherent conversations (3.6k)
from three shopping domains. Finally, we demonstrate the quality and
effectiveness of WoS via human evaluations and downstream tasks.

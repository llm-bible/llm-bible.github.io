Motivated by the substantial achievements observed in Large Language Models (LLMs) in the field of natural language processing recent research has commenced investigations into the application of LLMs for complex long-horizon sequential task planning challenges in robotics. LLMs are advantageous in offering the potential to enhance the generalizability as task-agnostic planners and facilitate flexible interaction between human instructors and planning systems. However task plans generated by LLMs often lack feasibility and correctness. To address this challenge we introduce ISR-LLM a novel framework that improves LLM-based planning through an iterative self-refinement process. The framework operates through three sequential steps preprocessing planning and iterative self-refinement. During preprocessing an LLM translator is employed to convert natural language input into a Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) formulation. In the planning phase an LLM planner formulates an initial plan which is then assessed and refined in the iterative self-refinement step by using a validator. We examine the performance of ISR-LLM across three distinct planning domains. The results show that ISR-LLM is able to achieve markedly higher success rates in task accomplishments compared to state-of-the-art LLM-based planners. Moreover it also preserves the broad applicability and generalizability of working with natural language instructions.

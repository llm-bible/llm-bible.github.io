A new trend in the computer vision community is to capture objects of interest following flexible human command represented by a natural language prompt. However the progress of using language prompts in driving scenarios is stuck in a bottleneck due to the scarcity of paired prompt-instance data. To address this challenge we propose the first object-centric language prompt set for driving scenes within 3D multi-view and multi-frame space named NuPrompt. It expands Nuscenes dataset by constructing a total of 35367 language descriptions each referring to an average of 5.3 object tracks. Based on the object-text pairs from the new benchmark we formulate a new prompt-based driving task (ie) employing a language prompt to predict the described object trajectory across views and frames. Furthermore we provide a simple end-to-end baseline model based on Transformer named PromptTrack. Experiments show that our PromptTrack achieves impressive performance on NuPrompt. We hope this work can provide more new insights for the autonomous driving community. Dataset and Code will be made public at (href)https://github.com/wudongming97/Prompt4Driving\}\{https://github.com/wudongming97/Prompt4Driving\}."

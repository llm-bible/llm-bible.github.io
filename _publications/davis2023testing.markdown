This report describes a test of the large language model GPT45;4 with the Wolfram Alpha and the Code Interpreter plug45;ins on 105 original problems in science and math at the high school and college levels carried out in June45;August 2023. Our tests suggest that the plug45;ins significantly enhance GPTs ability to solve these problems. Having said that there are still often interface failures; that is GPT often has trouble formulating problems in a way that elicits useful answers from the plug45;ins. Fixing these interface failures seems like a central challenge in making GPT a reliable tool for college45;level calculation problems.

ChatGPT is an AI language model developed by OpenAI that can understand and
generate human-like text. It can be used for a variety of use cases such as
language generation, question answering, text summarization, chatbot
development, language translation, sentiment analysis, content creation,
personalization, text completion, and storytelling. While ChatGPT has garnered
significant positive attention, it has also generated a sense of apprehension
and uncertainty in academic circles. There is concern that students may
leverage ChatGPT to complete take-home assignments and exams and obtain
favorable grades without genuinely acquiring knowledge. This paper adopts a
quantitative approach to demonstrate ChatGPT's high degree of unreliability in
answering a diverse range of questions pertaining to topics in undergraduate
computer science. Our analysis shows that students may risk self-sabotage by
blindly depending on ChatGPT to complete assignments and exams. We build upon
this analysis to provide constructive recommendations to both students and
instructors.

Large language models~(LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various applications among which role45;playing language agents (RPLAs) have engaged a broad user base. Now there is a growing demand for RPLAs that represent Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) ie Internet celebrities who shape the trends and opinions in their domains. However research in this line remains underexplored. In this paper we hence introduce MINDECHO a comprehensive framework for the development and evaluation of KOL RPLAs. MINDECHO collects KOL data from Internet video transcripts in various professional fields and synthesizes their conversations leveraging GPT45;4. Then the conversations and the transcripts are used for individualized model training and inference45;time retrieval respectively. Our evaluation covers both general dimensions (ie knowledge and tones) and fan45;centric dimensions for KOLs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MINDECHO in developing and evaluating KOL RPLAs.

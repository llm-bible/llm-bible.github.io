'We cast retrosynthesis as a machine translation problem by introducing a special Tensor2Tensor, an entire attention-based and fully data-driven model. Given a data set comprising about 50,000 diverse reactions extracted from USPTO patents, the model significantly outperforms seq2seq model (34.7&#37;) on a top-1 accuracy by achieving 54.1&#37;. For yielding better results, parameters such as batch size and training time are thoroughly investigated to train the model. Additionally, we offer a novel insight into the causes of grammatically invalid SMILES, and conduct a test in which experienced chemists pick out and analyze the wrong predictions that may be chemically plausible but differ from the ground truth. Actually, the effectiveness of our model is un-derestimated and the true top-1 accuracy can reach to 64.6&#37;.'

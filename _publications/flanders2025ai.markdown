This paper explores the use of large language models (LLMs), here represented
by GPT 3.5-Turbo to perform coding for a thematic analysis. Coding is highly
labor intensive, making it infeasible for most researchers to conduct
exhaustive thematic analyses of large corpora. We utilize few-shot prompting
with higher quality codes generated on semantically similar passages to enhance
the quality of the codes while utilizing a cheap, more easily scalable model.

Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable machine translation (MT) abilities via prompting even though they were not explicitly trained for this task. However even given the incredible quantities of data they are trained on LLMs can struggle to translate inputs with rare words which are common in low resource or domain transfer scenarios. We show that LLM prompting can provide an effective solution for rare words as well by using prior knowledge from bilingual dictionaries to provide control hints in the prompts. We propose a novel method DiPMT that provides a set of possible translations for a subset of the input words thereby enabling fine45;grained phrase45;level prompted control of the LLM. Extensive experiments show that DiPMT outperforms the baseline both in low45;resource MT as well as for out45;of45;domain MT. We further provide a qualitative analysis of the benefits and limitations of this approach including the overall level of controllability that is achieved.

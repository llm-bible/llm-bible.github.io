Task45;oriented dialogue focuses on conversational agents that participate in user45;initiated dialogues on domain45;specific topics. In contrast to chatbots which simply seek to sustain open45;ended meaningful discourse existing task45;oriented agents usually explicitly model user intent and belief states. This paper examines bypassing such an explicit representation by depending on a latent neural embedding of state and learning selective attention to dialogue history together with copying to incorporate relevant prior context. We complement recent work by showing the effectiveness of simple sequence45;to45;sequence neural architectures with a copy mechanism. Our model outperforms more complex memory45;augmented models by 737; in per45;response generation and is on par with the current state45;of45;the45;art on DSTC2.

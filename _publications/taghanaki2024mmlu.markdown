Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top45;performing models underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU45;Pro+ an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU45;Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher45;order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains MMLU45;Pro+ tests LLMs ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem45;solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU45;Pro+ maintains MMLU45;Pros difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination particularly in multi45;correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of five state45;of45;the45;art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility. We release the dataset and evaluation codes at url123;https://github.com/asgsaeid/mmlu&#45;pro&#45;plus&#125;.

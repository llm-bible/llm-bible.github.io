Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) increasingly struggle to differentiate between top-performing models underscoring the need for more challenging evaluation frameworks. We introduce MMLU-Pro+ an enhanced benchmark building upon MMLU-Pro to assess shortcut learning and higher-order reasoning in LLMs. By incorporating questions with multiple correct answers across diverse domains MMLU-Pro+ tests LLMs ability to engage in complex reasoning and resist simplistic problem-solving strategies. Our results show that MMLU-Pro+ maintains MMLU-Pros difficulty while providing a more rigorous test of model discrimination particularly in multi-correct answer scenarios. We introduce novel metrics like shortcut selection ratio and correct pair identification ratio offering deeper insights into model behavior and anchoring bias. Evaluations of five state-of-the-art LLMs reveal significant performance gaps highlighting variations in reasoning abilities and bias susceptibility. We release the dataset and evaluation codes at (url)https://github.com/asgsaeid/mmlu-pro-plus\}.

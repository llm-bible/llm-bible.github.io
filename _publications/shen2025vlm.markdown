Recently DeepSeek R1 has shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can
substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) through a simple yet effective design. The core of R1 lies in its
rule-based reward formulation, which leverages tasks with deterministic
ground-truth answers to enable precise and stable reward computation. In the
visual domain, we similarly observe that a wide range of visual understanding
tasks are inherently equipped with well-defined ground-truth annotations. This
property makes them naturally compatible with rule-based reward mechanisms.
Motivated by this observation, we investigate the extension of R1-style
reinforcement learning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), aiming to enhance
their visual reasoning capabilities. To this end, we develop VLM-R1, a
dedicated framework designed to harness RL for improving VLMs' performance on
general vision-language tasks. Using this framework, we further explore the
feasibility of applying RL to visual domain. Experimental results indicate that
the RL-based model not only delivers competitive performance on visual
understanding tasks but also surpasses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in
generalization ability. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies
that uncover a series of noteworthy insights, including the presence of reward
hacking in object detection, the emergence of the "OD aha moment", the impact
of training data quality, and the scaling behavior of RL across different model
sizes. Through these analyses, we aim to deepen the understanding of how
reinforcement learning enhances the capabilities of vision-language models, and
we hope our findings and open-source contributions will support continued
progress in the vision-language RL community. Our code and model are available

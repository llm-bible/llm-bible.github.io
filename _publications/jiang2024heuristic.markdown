Few45;Shot Aspect45;Based Sentiment Analysis (FSABSA) is an indispensable and highly challenging task in natural language processing. However methods based on Pre45;trained Language Models (PLMs) struggle to accommodate multiple sub45;tasks and methods based on Generative Pre45;trained Transformers (GPTs) perform poorly. To address the above issues the paper designs a Heuristic45;enhanced Candidates Selection (HCS) strategy and further proposes All in One (AiO) model based on it. The model works in a two45;stage which simultaneously accommodates the accuracy of PLMs and the generalization capability of GPTs. Specifically in the first stage a backbone model based on PLMs generates rough heuristic candidates for the input sentence. In the second stage AiO leverages LLMs contextual learning capabilities to generate precise predictions. The study conducted comprehensive comparative and ablation experiments on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can better adapt to multiple sub45;tasks and also outperforms the methods that directly utilize GPTs.

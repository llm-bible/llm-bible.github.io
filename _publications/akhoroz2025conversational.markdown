Conversational AI interfaces powered by large language models (LLMs) are
increasingly used as coding assistants. However, questions remain about how
programmers interact with LLM-based conversational agents, the challenges they
encounter, and the factors influencing adoption. This study investigates
programmers' usage patterns, perceptions, and interaction strategies when
engaging with LLM-driven coding assistants. Through a survey, participants
reported both the benefits, such as efficiency and clarity of explanations, and
the limitations, including inaccuracies, lack of contextual awareness, and
concerns about over-reliance. Notably, some programmers actively avoid LLMs due
to a preference for independent learning, distrust in AI-generated code, and
ethical considerations. Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for
improving conversational coding assistants, emphasizing context retention,
transparency, multimodal support, and adaptability to user preferences. These
insights contribute to the broader understanding of how LLM-based
conversational agents can be effectively integrated into software development
workflows while addressing adoption barriers and enhancing usability.

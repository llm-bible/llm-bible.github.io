The shortage of clinical workforce presents significant challenges in mental
healthcare, limiting access to formal diagnostics and services. We aim to
tackle this shortage by integrating a customized large language model (LLM)
into the workflow, thus promoting equity in mental healthcare for the general
population. Although LLMs have showcased their capability in clinical
decision-making, their adaptation to severe conditions like Post-traumatic
Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we collect 411
clinician-administered diagnostic interviews and devise a novel approach to
obtain high-quality data. Moreover, we build a comprehensive framework to
automate PTSD diagnostic assessments based on interview contents by leveraging
two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Llama-2, with potential for broader
clinical diagnoses. Our results illustrate strong promise for LLMs, tested on
our dataset, to aid clinicians in diagnostic validation. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first AI system that fully automates assessments for
mental illness based on clinician-administered interviews.

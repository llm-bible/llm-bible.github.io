The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the
field of Natural Language Processing and has transformed conversational tasks
across various domains because of their widespread integration in applications
and public access. The discussion surrounding the application of LLMs in
education has raised ethical concerns, particularly concerning plagiarism and
policy compliance. Despite the prowess of LLMs in conversational tasks, the
limitations of reliability and hallucinations exacerbate the need to guardrail
conversations, motivating our investigation of RAG in computer science higher
education. We developed Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications for
the two tasks of virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids. In our study,
we collected the ratings and opinions of faculty members in undergraduate and
graduate computer science university courses at various levels, using our
personalized RAG systems for each course. This study is the first to gather
faculty feedback on the application of LLM-based RAG in education. The
investigation revealed that while faculty members acknowledge the potential of
RAG systems as virtual teaching assistants and teaching aids, certain barriers
and features are suggested for their full-scale deployment. These findings
contribute to the ongoing discussion on the integration of advanced language
models in educational settings, highlighting the need for careful consideration
of ethical implications and the development of appropriate safeguards to ensure
responsible and effective implementation.

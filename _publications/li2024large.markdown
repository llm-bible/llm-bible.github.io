Large Language Models (LLMs) AI models trained on massive text corpora with remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities are transforming the field of Autonomous Driving (AD). As AD systems evolve from rule45;based and optimization45;based methods to learning45;based techniques like deep reinforcement learning they are now poised to embrace a third and more advanced category knowledge45;based AD empowered by LLMs. This shift promises to bring AD closer to human45;like AD. However integrating LLMs into AD systems poses challenges in real45;time inference safety assurance and deployment costs. This survey provides a comprehensive and critical review of recent progress in leveraging LLMs for AD focusing on their applications in modular AD pipelines and end45;to45;end AD systems. We highlight key advancements identify pressing challenges and propose promising research directions to bridge the gap between LLMs and AD thereby facilitating the development of more human45;like AD systems. The survey first introduces LLMs key features and common training schemes then delves into their applications in modular AD pipelines and end45;to45;end AD respectively followed by discussions on open challenges and future directions. Through this in45;depth analysis we aim to provide insights and inspiration for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of AI and autonomous vehicles ultimately contributing to safer smarter and more human45;centric AD technologies.

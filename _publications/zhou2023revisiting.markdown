Current literature demonstrates that Large Language Models (LLMs) are great few45;shot learners and prompting significantly increases their performance on a range of downstream tasks in a few45;shot learning setting. An attempt to automate human45;led prompting followed with some progress achieved. In particular subsequent work demonstrates automation can outperform fine45;tuning in certain K45;shot learning scenarios. In this paper we revisit techniques for automated prompting on six different downstream tasks and a larger range of K45;shot learning settings. We find that automated prompting does not consistently outperform simple manual prompts. Our work suggests that in addition to fine45;tuning manual prompts should be used as a baseline in this line of research.

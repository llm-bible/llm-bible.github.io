This paper presents a system for diversity45;aware autonomous conversation leveraging the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The system adapts to diverse populations and individuals considering factors like background personality age gender and culture. The conversation flow is guided by the structure of the systems pre45;established knowledge base while LLMs are tasked with various functions including generating diversity45;aware sentences. Achieving diversity45;awareness involves providing carefully crafted prompts to the models incorporating comprehensive information about users conversation history contextual details and specific guidelines. To assess the systems performance we conducted both controlled and real45;world experiments measuring a wide range of performance indicators.

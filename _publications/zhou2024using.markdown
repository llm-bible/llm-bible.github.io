Our team participated in the BioASQ 2024 Task12b and Synergy tasks to build a system that can answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant articles and snippets from the PubMed database and generating exact and ideal answers. We propose a two45;level information retrieval and question45;answering system based on pre45;trained large language models (LLM) focused on LLM prompt engineering and response post45;processing. We construct prompts with in45;context few45;shot examples and utilize post45;processing techniques like resampling and malformed response detection. We compare the performance of various pre45;trained LLM models on this challenge including Mixtral OpenAI GPT and Llama2. Our best45;performing system achieved 0.14 MAP score on document retrieval 0.05 MAP score on snippet retrieval 0.96 F1 score for yes/no questions 0.38 MRR score for factoid questions and 0.50 F1 score for list questions in Task 12b.

The rise of (multimodal) large language models (LLMs) has shed light on
software agent -- where software can understand and follow user instructions in
natural language. However, existing approaches such as API-based and GUI-based
agents are far from satisfactory at accuracy and efficiency aspects. Instead,
we advocate to endow LLMs with access to the software internals (source code
and runtime context) and the permission to dynamically inject generated code
into software for execution. In such a whitebox setting, one may better
leverage the software context and the coding ability of LLMs. We then present
an overall design architecture and case studies on two popular web-based
desktop applications. We also give in-depth discussion of the challenges and
future directions. We deem that such a new paradigm has the potential to
fundamentally overturn the existing software agent design, and finally creating
a digital world in which software can comprehend, operate, collaborate, and
even think to meet complex user needs.

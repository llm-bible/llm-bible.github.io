In Natural Language Processing (NLP) Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated high text generation quality. However in real45;world applications LLMs must meet increasingly complex requirements. Beyond avoiding misleading or inappropriate content LLMs are also expected to cater to specific user needs such as imitating particular writing styles or generating text with poetic richness. These varied demands have driven the development of Controllable Text Generation (CTG) techniques which ensure that outputs adhere to predefined control conditions45;45;such as safety sentiment thematic consistency and linguistic style45;45;while maintaining high standards of helpfulness fluency and diversity. This paper systematically reviews the latest advancements in CTG for LLMs offering a comprehensive definition of its core concepts and clarifying the requirements for control conditions and text quality. We categorize CTG tasks into two primary types content control and attribute control. The key methods are discussed including model retraining fine45;tuning reinforcement learning prompt engineering latent space manipulation and decoding45;time intervention. We analyze each methods characteristics advantages and limitations providing nuanced insights for achieving generation control. Additionally we review CTG evaluation methods summarize its applications across domains and address key challenges in current research including reduced fluency and practicality. We also propose several appeals such as placing greater emphasis on real45;world applications in future research. This paper aims to offer valuable guidance to researchers and developers in the field. Our reference list and Chinese version are open45;sourced at https://github.com/IAAR&#45;Shanghai/CTGSurvey.

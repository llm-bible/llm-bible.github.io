We present PLUGH (https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=plugh), a
modern benchmark that currently consists of 5 tasks, each with 125 input texts
extracted from 48 different games and representing 61 different
(non-isomorphic) spatial graphs to assess the abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for spatial understanding and reasoning. Our evaluation of
API-based and open-sourced LLMs shows that while some commercial LLMs exhibit
strong reasoning abilities, open-sourced competitors can demonstrate almost the
same level of quality; however, all models still have significant room for
improvement. We identify typical reasons for LLM failures and discuss possible
ways to deal with them. Datasets and evaluation code are released
(https://github.com/altsoph/PLUGH).

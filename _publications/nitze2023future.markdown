This study explores the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) in higher education focusing on an automated oral examination simulation using a prototype. The design considerations of the prototype are described and the system is evaluated with a select group of educators and students. Technical and pedagogical observations are discussed. The prototype proved to be effective in simulating oral exams providing personalized feedback and streamlining educators workloads. The promising results of the prototype show the potential for LLMs in democratizing education inclusion of diverse student populations and improvement of teaching quality and efficiency.

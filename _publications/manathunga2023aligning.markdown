Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability showcasing their capacity to excel in tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. However despite their impressive natural language processing (NLP) capabilities effective alignment of LLMs remains a crucial challenge when deploying them for specific clinical applications. The ability to generate responses with factually accurate content and to engage in non45;trivial reasoning steps are crucial for the LLMs to be eligible for applications in clinical medicine. Employing a combination of techniques including instruction45;tuning and in45;prompt strategies like few45;shot and chain45;of45;thought prompting has significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs. Our proposed alignment strategy for medical question45;answering known as expand45;guess45;refine offers a parameter and data45;efficient solution. A preliminary analysis of this method demonstrated outstanding performance achieving a score of 70.6337; on a subset of questions sourced from the USMLE dataset.

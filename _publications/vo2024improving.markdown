Machine translation for Vietnamese-English in the medical domain is still an
under-explored research area. In this paper, we introduce MedEV -- a
high-quality Vietnamese-English parallel dataset constructed specifically for
the medical domain, comprising approximately 360K sentence pairs. We conduct
extensive experiments comparing Google Translate, ChatGPT (gpt-3.5-turbo),
state-of-the-art Vietnamese-English neural machine translation models and
pre-trained bilingual/multilingual sequence-to-sequence models on our new MedEV
dataset. Experimental results show that the best performance is achieved by
fine-tuning "vinai-translate" for each translation direction. We publicly
release our dataset to promote further research.

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has reshaped the field
of natural language processing (NLP), with models like OpenAI ChatGPT and
DeepSeek AI. Although ChatGPT established a strong foundation for
conversational AI, DeepSeek AI introduces significant improvements in
architecture, performance, and ethical considerations. This paper presents a
detailed analysis of the evolution from ChatGPT to DeepSeek AI, highlighting
their technical differences, practical applications, and broader implications
for AI development. To assess their capabilities, we conducted a case study
using a predefined set of multiple choice questions in various domains,
evaluating the strengths and limitations of each model. By examining these
aspects, we provide valuable insight into the future trajectory of AI, its
potential to transform industries, and key research directions for improving
AI-driven language models.

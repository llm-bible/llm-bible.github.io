Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently discussed in academia and the
general public as support tools for virtually any use case that relies on the
production of text, including software engineering. Currently there is much
debate, but little empirical evidence, regarding the practical usefulness of
LLM-based tools such as ChatGPT for engineers in industry. We conduct an
observational study of 24 professional software engineers who have been using
ChatGPT over a period of one week in their jobs, and qualitatively analyse
their dialogues with the chatbot as well as their overall experience (as
captured by an exit survey). We find that, rather than expecting ChatGPT to
generate ready-to-use software artifacts (e.g., code), practitioners more often
use ChatGPT to receive guidance on how to solve their tasks or learn about a
topic in more abstract terms. We also propose a theoretical framework for how
(i) purpose of the interaction, (ii) internal factors (e.g., the user's
personality), and (iii) external factors (e.g., company policy) together shape
the experience (in terms of perceived usefulness and trust). We envision that
our framework can be used by future research to further the academic discussion
on LLM usage by software engineering practitioners, and to serve as a reference
point for the design of future empirical LLM research in this domain.

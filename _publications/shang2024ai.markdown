Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the world with the sparks of artificial general intelligence (AGI). One opinion especially from some startups working on LLMs argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context length can realize AGI. However they might be too optimistic about the long45;context capability of (existing) LLMs 45;45; (1) Recent literature has shown that their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed context length; and (2) Our reasoning45;in45;a45;haystack experiments further demonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long context and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper we envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of emph123;memory125;. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core processors. In addition to raw data the memory in this system would store a large number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes. Compared with retrieval45;augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw data this approach not only connects semantically related information closer but also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying. As an intermediate stage the memory will likely be in the form of natural language descriptions which can be directly consumed by users too. Ultimately every agent/person should have its own large personal model a deep neural network model (thus emph123;AI45;native125;) that parameterizes and compresses all types of memory even the ones cannot be described by natural languages. Finally we discuss the significant potential of AI45;native memory as the transformative infrastructure for (proactive) engagement personalization distribution and social in the AGI era as well as the incurred privacy and security challenges with preliminary solutions.

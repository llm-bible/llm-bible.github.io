Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents
capable of performing various sequential decision-making tasks. However,
effectively guiding LLMs to perform well in unfamiliar domains like web
navigation, where they lack sufficient knowledge, has proven to be difficult
with the demonstration-based in-context learning paradigm. In this paper, we
introduce a novel framework, called AutoGuide, which addresses this limitation
by automatically generating context-aware guidelines from offline experiences.
Importantly, each context-aware guideline is expressed in concise natural
language and follows a conditional structure, clearly describing the context
where it is applicable. As a result, our guidelines facilitate the provision of
relevant knowledge for the agent's current decision-making process, overcoming
the limitations of the conventional demonstration-based learning paradigm. Our
evaluation demonstrates that AutoGuide significantly outperforms competitive
baselines in complex benchmark domains, including real-world web navigation.

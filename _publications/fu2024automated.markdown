The primary limitation of large language models (LLMs) is their restricted understanding of the world. This poses significant difficulties for LLM45;based agents particularly in domains where pre45;trained LLMs lack sufficient knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel framework called AutoGuide that bridges the knowledge gap in pre45;trained LLMs by leveraging implicit knowledge in offline experiences. Specifically AutoGuide effectively extracts knowledge embedded in offline data by extracting a set of state45;aware guidelines. Importantly each state45;aware guideline is expressed in concise natural language and follows a conditional structure clearly describing the state where it is applicable. As such the resulting guidelines enable a principled way to provide helpful knowledge pertinent to an agents current decision45;making process. We show that our approach outperforms competitive LLM45;based baselines by a large margin in sequential decision45;making benchmarks.

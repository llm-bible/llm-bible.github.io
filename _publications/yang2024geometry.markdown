Digital health chatbots powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly improve personal health management for chronic conditions by providing accessible and on45;demand health coaching and question45;answering. However these chatbots risk providing unverified and inaccurate information because LLMs generate responses based on patterns learned from diverse internet data. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) can help mitigate hallucinations and inaccuracies in LLM responses by grounding it on reliable content. However efficiently and accurately retrieving most relevant set of content for real45;time user questions remains a challenge. In this work we introduce Query45;Based Retrieval Augmented Generation (QB45;RAG) a novel approach that pre45;computes a database of potential queries from a content base using LLMs. For an incoming patient question QB45;RAG efficiently matches it against this pre45;generated query database using vector search improving alignment between user questions and the content. We establish a theoretical foundation for QB45;RAG and provide a comparative analysis of existing retrieval enhancement techniques for RAG systems. Finally our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QB45;RAG significantly improves the accuracy of healthcare question answering paving the way for robust and trustworthy LLM applications in digital health.

Effective teaching requires adapting instructional strategies to accommodate the diverse cognitive and behavioral profiles of students, a persistent challenge in education and teacher training. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise as tools to simulate such complex pedagogical environments, current simulation frameworks are limited in two key respects: (1) they often reduce students to static knowledge profiles, and (2) they lack adaptive mechanisms for modeling teachers who evolve their strategies in response to student feedback. To address these gaps, \textbf\{we introduce a novel simulation framework that integrates LLM-based heterogeneous student agents with a self-optimizing teacher agent\}. The teacher agent's pedagogical policy is dynamically evolved using a genetic algorithm, allowing it to discover and refine effective teaching strategies based on the aggregate performance of diverse learners. In addition, \textbf\{we propose Persona-RAG\}, a Retrieval Augmented Generation module that enables student agents to retrieve knowledge tailored to their individual learning styles. Persona-RAG preserves the retrieval accuracy of standard RAG baselines while enhancing personalization, an essential factor in modeling realistic educational scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate how our framework supports the emergence of distinct and interpretable teaching patterns when interacting with varied student populations. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-driven simulations to inform adaptive teaching practices and provide a testbed for training human educators in controlled, data-driven environments.

The promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Natural Language Processing has often been overshadowed by their limited performance in low45;resource languages such as Bangla. To address this our paper presents a pioneering approach that utilizes cross45;lingual retrieval augmented in45;context learning. By strategically sourcing semantically similar prompts from high45;resource language we enable multilingual pretrained language models (MPLMs) especially the generative model BLOOMZ to successfully boost performance on Bangla tasks. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the cross45;lingual retrieval augmented prompts bring steady improvements to MPLMs over the zero45;shot performance.

In the burgeoning field of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA Prompt Engineering (PE) is renowned for boosting zero45;shot or in45;context learning (ICL) through prompt modifications. Yet the realm of the sample design for downstream fine45;tuning crucial for task45;specific LLM adaptation is largely unexplored. This paper introduces Sample Design Engineering (SDE) a methodical approach to enhancing LLMs post45;tuning performance by refining input output and reasoning designs. We conduct a series of in45;domain (ID) and out45;of45;domain (OOD) experiments to assess the impact of various design options on LLMs downstream performance revealing several intriguing patterns that hold consistently across different LLMs. Based on these insights we propose an integrated SDE strategy combining the most effective options and validate its consistent superiority over heuristic sample designs in complex downstream tasks like multi45;aspect sentiment analysis event extraction and nested entity recognition. Additionally analyses of LLMs inherent prompt/output perplexity zero45;shot and ICL abilities illustrate that good PE strategies may not always translate to good SDE strategies.

This study explores the effectiveness of using knowledge graphs generated by
large language models to decompose high school-level physics questions into
sub-questions. We introduce a pipeline aimed at enhancing model response
quality for Question Answering tasks. By employing LLMs to construct knowledge
graphs that capture the internal logic of the questions, these graphs then
guide the generation of subquestions. We hypothesize that this method yields
sub-questions that are more logically consistent with the original questions
compared to traditional decomposition techniques. Our results show that
sub-questions derived from knowledge graphs exhibit significantly improved
fidelity to the original question's logic. This approach not only enhances the
learning experience by providing clearer and more contextually appropriate
sub-questions but also highlights the potential of LLMs to transform
educational methodologies. The findings indicate a promising direction for
applying AI to improve the quality and effectiveness of educational content.

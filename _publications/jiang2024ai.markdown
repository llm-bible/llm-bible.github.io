The rise of "bedroom producers" has democratized music creation, while
challenging producers to objectively evaluate their work. To address this, we
present AI TrackMate, an LLM-based music chatbot designed to provide
constructive feedback on music productions. By combining LLMs' inherent musical
knowledge with direct audio track analysis, AI TrackMate offers
production-specific insights, distinguishing it from text-only approaches. Our
framework integrates a Music Analysis Module, an LLM-Readable Music Report, and
Music Production-Oriented Feedback Instruction, creating a plug-and-play,
training-free system compatible with various LLMs and adaptable to future
advancements. We demonstrate AI TrackMate's capabilities through an interactive
web interface and present findings from a pilot study with a music producer. By
bridging AI capabilities with the needs of independent producers, AI TrackMate
offers on-demand analytical feedback, potentially supporting the creative
process and skill development in music production. This system addresses the
growing demand for objective self-assessment tools in the evolving landscape of
independent music production.

This paper empirically investigates the relationship between subword
vocabulary size and the performance of large language models (LLMs) to provide
insights on how to define the vocabulary size. Experimental results show that
larger vocabulary sizes lead to better performance in LLMs. Moreover, we
consider a continual training scenario where a pre-trained language model is
trained on a different target language. We introduce a simple method to use a
new vocabulary instead of the pre-defined one. We show that using the new
vocabulary outperforms the model with the vocabulary used in pre-training.

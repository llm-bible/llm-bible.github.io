Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce responses that exhibit social biases and support stereotypes. However conventional benchmarking is insufficient to thoroughly evaluate LLM bias as it can not scale to large sets of prompts and provides no guarantees. Therefore we propose a novel certification framework QuaCer45;B (Quantitative Certification of Bias) that provides formal guarantees on obtaining unbiased responses from target LLMs under large sets of prompts. A certificate consists of high45;confidence bounds on the probability of obtaining biased responses from the LLM for any set of prompts containing sensitive attributes sampled from a distribution. We illustrate the bias certification in LLMs for prompts with various prefixes drawn from given distributions. We consider distributions of random token sequences mixtures of manual jailbreaks and jailbreaks in the LLMs embedding space to certify its bias. We certify popular LLMs with QuaCer45;B and present novel insights into their biases.

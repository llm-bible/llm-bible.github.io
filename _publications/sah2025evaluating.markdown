Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
application to recommender systems (RecLLMs), yet concerns remain regarding
fairness across demographic and psychological user dimensions. We introduce
FairEval, a novel evaluation framework to systematically assess fairness in
LLM-based recommendations. FairEval integrates personality traits with eight
sensitive demographic attributes,including gender, race, and age, enabling a
comprehensive assessment of user-level bias. We evaluate models, including
ChatGPT 4o and Gemini 1.5 Flash, on music and movie recommendations. FairEval's
fairness metric, PAFS, achieves scores up to 0.9969 for ChatGPT 4o and 0.9997
for Gemini 1.5 Flash, with disparities reaching 34.79 percent. These results
highlight the importance of robustness in prompt sensitivity and support more
inclusive recommendation systems.

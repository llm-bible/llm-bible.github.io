Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various information45;seeking and reasoning tasks. These computational systems drive state45;of45;the45;art dialogue systems such as ChatGPT and Bard. They also carry substantial promise in meeting the growing demands of mental health care albeit relatively unexplored. As such this study sought to examine LLMs capability to generate empathetic responses in conversations that emulate those in a mental health counselling setting. We selected five LLMs version 3.5 and version 4 of the Generative Pre45;training (GPT) Vicuna FastChat45;T5 Pathways Language Model (PaLM) version 2 and Falcon45;7B45;Instruct. Based on a simple instructional prompt these models responded to utterances derived from the EmpatheticDialogues (ED) dataset. Using three empathy45;related metrics we compared their responses to those from traditional response generation dialogue systems which were fine45;tuned on the ED dataset along with human45;generated responses. Notably we discovered that responses from the LLMs were remarkably more empathetic in most scenarios. We position our findings in light of catapulting advancements in creating empathetic conversational systems.

The evolution of agentic systems represents a significant milestone in
artificial intelligence and modern software systems, driven by the demand for
vertical intelligence tailored to diverse industries. These systems enhance
business outcomes through adaptability, learning, and interaction with dynamic
environments. At the forefront of this revolution are Large Language Model
(LLM) agents, which serve as the cognitive backbone of these intelligent
systems. In response to the need for consistency and scalability, this work
attempts to define a level of standardization for Vertical AI agent design
patterns by identifying core building blocks and proposing a \textbf\{Cognitive
Skills \} Module, which incorporates domain-specific, purpose-built inference
capabilities. Building on these foundational concepts, this paper offers a
comprehensive introduction to agentic systems, detailing their core components,
operational patterns, and implementation strategies. It further explores
practical use cases and examples across various industries, highlighting the
transformative potential of LLM agents in driving industry-specific
applications.

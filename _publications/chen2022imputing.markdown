State45;of45;the45;art NLP systems represent inputs with word embeddings but these are brittle when faced with Out45;of45;Vocabulary (OOV) words. To address this issue we follow the principle of mimick45;like models to generate vectors for unseen words by learning the behavior of pre45;trained embeddings using only the surface form of words. We present a simple contrastive learning framework LOVE which extends the word representation of an existing pre45;trained language model (such as BERT) and makes it robust to OOV with few additional parameters. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our lightweight model achieves similar or even better performances than prior competitors both on original datasets and on corrupted variants. Moreover it can be used in a plug45;and45;play fashion with FastText and BERT where it significantly improves their robustness.

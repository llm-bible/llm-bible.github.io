End-to-end task-oriented dialog systems usually suffer from the challenge of incorporating knowledge bases. In this paper we propose a novel yet simple end-to-end differentiable model called memory-to-sequence (Mem2Seq) to address this issue. Mem2Seq is the first neural generative model that combines the multi-hop attention over memories with the idea of pointer network. We empirically show how Mem2Seq controls each generation step and how its multi-hop attention mechanism helps in learning correlations between memories. In addition our model is quite general without complicated task-specific designs. As a result we show that Mem2Seq can be trained faster and attain the state-of-the-art performance on three different task-oriented dialog datasets.

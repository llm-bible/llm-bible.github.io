End45;to45;end task45;oriented dialog systems usually suffer from the challenge of incorporating knowledge bases. In this paper we propose a novel yet simple end45;to45;end differentiable model called memory45;to45;sequence (Mem2Seq) to address this issue. Mem2Seq is the first neural generative model that combines the multi45;hop attention over memories with the idea of pointer network. We empirically show how Mem2Seq controls each generation step and how its multi45;hop attention mechanism helps in learning correlations between memories. In addition our model is quite general without complicated task45;specific designs. As a result we show that Mem2Seq can be trained faster and attain the state45;of45;the45;art performance on three different task45;oriented dialog datasets.

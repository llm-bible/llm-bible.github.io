In today's assistant landscape, personalisation enhances interactions,
fosters long-term relationships, and deepens engagement. However, many systems
struggle with retaining user preferences, leading to repetitive user requests
and disengagement. Furthermore, the unregulated and opaque extraction of user
preferences in industry applications raises significant concerns about privacy
and trust, especially in regions with stringent regulations like Europe. In
response to these challenges, we propose a long-term memory system for voice
assistants, structured around predefined categories. This approach leverages
Large Language Models to efficiently extract, store, and retrieve preferences
within these categories, ensuring both personalisation and transparency. We
also introduce a synthetic multi-turn, multi-session conversation dataset
(CarMem), grounded in real industry data, tailored to an in-car voice assistant
setting. Benchmarked on the dataset, our system achieves an F1-score of .78 to
.95 in preference extraction, depending on category granularity. Our
maintenance strategy reduces redundant preferences by 95% and contradictory
ones by 92%, while the accuracy of optimal retrieval is at .87. Collectively,
the results demonstrate the system's suitability for industrial applications.

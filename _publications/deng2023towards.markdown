Large Language Models (LLMs) employing Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) prompting have broadened the scope for improving multi45;step reasoning capabilities. We generally divide multi45;step reasoning into two phases path generation to generate the reasoning path(s); and answer calibration post45;processing the reasoning path(s) to obtain a final answer. However the existing literature lacks systematic analysis on different answer calibration approaches. In this paper we summarize the taxonomy of recent answer calibration techniques and break them down into step45;level and path45;level strategies. We then conduct a thorough evaluation on these strategies from a unified view systematically scrutinizing step45;level and path45;level answer calibration across multiple paths. Experimental results reveal that integrating the dominance of both strategies tends to derive optimal outcomes. Our study holds the potential to illuminate key insights for optimizing multi45;step reasoning with answer calibration.

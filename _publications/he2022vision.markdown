Image and language modeling is of crucial importance for vision-language
pre-training (VLP), which aims to learn multi-modal representations from
large-scale paired image-text data. However, we observe that most existing VLP
methods focus on modeling the interactions between image and text features
while neglecting the information disparity between image and text, thus
suffering from focal bias. To address this problem, we propose a
vision-language masked autoencoder framework (VLMAE). VLMAE employs visual
generative learning, facilitating the model to acquire fine-grained and
unbiased features. Unlike the previous works, VLMAE pays attention to almost
all critical patches in an image, providing more comprehensive understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMAE achieves better performance in
various vision-language downstream tasks, including visual question answering,
image-text retrieval and visual grounding, even with up to 20% pre-training
speedup.

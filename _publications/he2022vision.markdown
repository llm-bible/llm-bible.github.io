Image and language modeling is of crucial importance for vision45;language pre45;training (VLP) which aims to learn multi45;modal representations from large45;scale paired image45;text data. However we observe that most existing VLP methods focus on modeling the interactions between image and text features while neglecting the information disparity between image and text thus suffering from focal bias. To address this problem we propose a vision45;language masked autoencoder framework (VLMAE). VLMAE employs visual generative learning facilitating the model to acquire fine45;grained and unbiased features. Unlike the previous works VLMAE pays attention to almost all critical patches in an image providing more comprehensive understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VLMAE achieves better performance in various vision45;language downstream tasks including visual question answering image45;text retrieval and visual grounding even with up to 2037; pre45;training speedup.

Large Language Model (LLM)-driven interactive systems currently show
potential promise in healthcare domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities,
LLMs typically lack personalized recommendations and diagnosis analysis in
sophisticated medical applications, causing hallucinations and performance
bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes MedAide, an
LLM-based omni medical multi-agent collaboration framework for specialized
healthcare services. Specifically, MedAide first performs query rewriting
through retrieval-augmented generation to accomplish accurate medical intent
understanding. Immediately, we devise a contextual encoder to obtain intent
prototype embeddings, which are used to recognize fine-grained intents by
similarity matching. According to the intent relevance, the activated agents
collaborate effectively to provide integrated decision analysis. Extensive
experiments are conducted on four medical benchmarks with composite intents.
Experimental results from automated metrics and expert doctor evaluations show
that MedAide outperforms current LLMs and improves their medical proficiency
and strategic reasoning.

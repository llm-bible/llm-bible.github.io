Recent advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial improvements in visual understanding primarily driven by sophisticated modality alignment strategies. However predominant approaches prioritize global or regional comprehension with less focus on fine-grained pixel-level tasks. To address this gap we introduce u-LLaVA an innovative unifying multi-task framework that integrates pixel regional and global features to refine the perceptual faculties of MLLMs. We commence by leveraging an efficient modality alignment approach harnessing both image and video datasets to bolster the models foundational understanding across diverse visual contexts. Subsequently a joint instruction tuning method with task-specific projectors and decoders for end-to-end downstream training is presented. Furthermore this work contributes a novel mask-based multi-task dataset comprising 277K samples crafted to challenge and assess the fine-grained perception capabilities of MLLMs. The overall framework is simple effective and achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. We also make our model data and code publicly accessible at https://github.com/OPPOMKLab/u-LLaVA.

To enhance the multi45;step reasoning capabilities of large language models researchers have extensively explored prompting methods notably the Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) method which explicitly elicits human45;like rationales. However they have inadvertently overlooked the potential of enhancing model reasoning performance by formulating higher45;quality problems. In this work we start from the problem side and propose Self45;Polish (SP) a novel method that facilitates the models reasoning by guiding it to progressively refine the given problems to be more comprehensible and solvable. We also explore several automatic prompting varients and propose the Self45;Polish prompt bank for the community. SP is orthogonal to all other prompting methods of answer/reasoning side like CoT allowing for seamless integration with state45;of45;the45;art techniques for further improvement. Thorough experiments show that the proposed method attains notable and consistent effectiveness on five reasoning benchmarks across different models. Furthermore our method also showcases impressive performance on robustness evaluation. Codes and prompts are available at https://github.com/WooooDyy/Self&#45;Polish.

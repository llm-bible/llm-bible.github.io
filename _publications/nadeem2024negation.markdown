Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the way we perceive technology. They have been shown to excel in tasks ranging from poem writing and coding to essay generation and puzzle solving. With the incorporation of image generation capability they have become more comprehensive and versatile AI tools. At the same time researchers are striving to identify the limitations of these tools to improve them further. Currently identified flaws include hallucination biases and bypassing restricted commands to generate harmful content. In the present work we have identified a fundamental limitation related to the image generation ability of LLMs and termed it The NO Syndrome. This negation blindness refers to LLMs inability to correctly comprehend NO related natural language prompts to generate the desired images. Interestingly all tested LLMs including GPT-4 Gemini and Copilot were found to be suffering from this syndrome. To demonstrate the generalization of this limitation we carried out simulation experiments and conducted entropy-based and benchmark statistical analysis tests on various LLMs in multiple languages including English Hindi and French. We conclude that the NO syndrome is a significant flaw in current LLMs that needs to be addressed. A related finding of this study showed a consistent discrepancy between image and textual responses as a result of this NO syndrome. We posit that the introduction of a negation context-aware reinforcement learning based feedback loop between the LLMs textual response and generated image could help ensure the generated text is based on both the LLMs correct contextual understanding of the negation query and the generated visual output.

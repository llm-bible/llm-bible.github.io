MetaDesigner revolutionizes artistic typography synthesis by leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) to drive a design paradigm centered around user engagement. At the core of this framework lies a multi-agent system comprising the Pipeline Glyph and Texture agents which collectively enable the creation of customized WordArt ranging from semantic enhancements to the imposition of complex textures. MetaDesigner incorporates a comprehensive feedback mechanism that harnesses insights from multimodal models and user evaluations to refine and enhance the design process iteratively. Through this feedback loop the system adeptly tunes hyperparameters to align with user-defined stylistic and thematic preferences generating WordArt that not only meets but exceeds user expectations of visual appeal and contextual relevance. Empirical validations highlight MetaDesigners capability to effectively serve diverse WordArt applications consistently producing aesthetically appealing and context-sensitive results.

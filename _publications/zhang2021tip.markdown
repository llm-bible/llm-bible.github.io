Contrastive Vision-Language Pre-training, known as CLIP, has provided a new
paradigm for learning visual representations by using large-scale contrastive
image-text pairs. It shows impressive performance on zero-shot knowledge
transfer to downstream tasks. To further enhance CLIP's few-shot capability,
CLIP-Adapter proposed to fine-tune a lightweight residual feature adapter and
significantly improves the performance for few-shot classification. However,
such a process still needs extra training and computational resources. In this
paper, we propose \textbf\{T\}raining-Free CL\textbf\{IP\}-\textbf\{Adapter\}
(\textbf\{Tip-Adapter\}), which not only inherits CLIP's training-free advantage
but also performs comparably or even better than CLIP-Adapter. Tip-Adapter does
not require any back propagation for training the adapter, but creates the
weights by a key-value cache model constructed from the few-shot training set.
In this non-parametric manner, Tip-Adapter acquires well-performed adapter
weights without any training, which is both efficient and effective. Moreover,
the performance of Tip-Adapter can be further boosted by fine-tuning such
properly initialized adapter for only a few epochs with super-fast convergence
speed. We conduct extensive experiments of few-shot classification on ImageNet
and other 10 datasets to demonstrate the superiority of proposed Tip-Adapter.

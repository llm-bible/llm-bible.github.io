Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant attention in healthcare consultation due to its potential to improve clinical workflow and enhance medical communication. However owing to the complex nature of medical information large language models (LLM) trained with general world knowledge might not possess the capability to tackle medical-related tasks at an expert level. Here we introduce EyeGPT a specialized LLM designed specifically for ophthalmology using three optimization strategies including role-playing finetuning and retrieval-augmented generation. In particular we proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework that encompasses a diverse dataset covering various subspecialties of ophthalmology different users and diverse inquiry intents. Moreover we considered multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy understandability trustworthiness empathy and the proportion of hallucinations. By assessing the performance of different EyeGPT variants we identify the most effective one which exhibits comparable levels of understandability trustworthiness and empathy to human ophthalmologists (all Ps0.05). Overall ur study provides valuable insights for future research facilitating comprehensive comparisons and evaluations of different strategies for developing specialized LLMs in ophthalmology. The potential benefits include enhancing the patient experience in eye care and optimizing ophthalmologists services.

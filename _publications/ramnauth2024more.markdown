Beyond mere formality, small talk plays a pivotal role in social dynamics,
serving as a verbal handshake for building rapport and understanding. For
conversational AI and social robots, the ability to engage in small talk
enhances their perceived sociability, leading to more comfortable and natural
user interactions. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of current Large
Language Models (LLMs) to drive the small talk of a social robot and identify
key areas for improvement. We introduce a novel method that autonomously
generates feedback and ensures LLM-generated responses align with small talk
conventions. Through several evaluations -- involving chatbot interactions and
human-robot interactions -- we demonstrate the system's effectiveness in
guiding LLM-generated responses toward realistic, human-like, and natural
small-talk exchanges.

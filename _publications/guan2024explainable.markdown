Autonomous mobile app interaction has become increasingly important with
growing complexity of mobile applications. Developing intelligent agents that
can effectively navigate and interact with mobile apps remains a significant
challenge. In this paper, we propose an Explainable Behavior Cloning LLM Agent
(EBC-LLMAgent), a novel approach that combines large language models (LLMs)
with behavior cloning by learning demonstrations to create intelligent and
explainable agents for autonomous mobile app interaction. EBC-LLMAgent consists
of three core modules: Demonstration Encoding, Code Generation, and UI Mapping,
which work synergistically to capture user demonstrations, generate executable
codes, and establish accurate correspondence between code and UI elements. We
introduce the Behavior Cloning Chain Fusion technique to enhance the
generalization capabilities of the agent. Extensive experiments on five popular
mobile applications from diverse domains demonstrate the superior performance
of EBC-LLMAgent, achieving high success rates in task completion, efficient
generalization to unseen scenarios, and the generation of meaningful
explanations.

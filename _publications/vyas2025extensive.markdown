In recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
proficiency in code generation and chain-of-thought reasoning, laying the
groundwork for tackling automatic formal planning tasks. This study evaluates
the potential of LLMs to understand and generate Planning Domain Definition
Language (PDDL), an essential representation in artificial intelligence
planning. We conduct an extensive analysis across 20 distinct models spanning 7
major LLM families, both commercial and open-source. Our comprehensive
evaluation sheds light on the zero-shot LLM capabilities of parsing,
generating, and reasoning with PDDL. Our findings indicate that while some
models demonstrate notable effectiveness in handling PDDL, others pose
limitations in more complex scenarios requiring nuanced planning knowledge.
These results highlight the promise and current limitations of LLMs in formal
planning tasks, offering insights into their application and guiding future
efforts in AI-driven planning paradigms.

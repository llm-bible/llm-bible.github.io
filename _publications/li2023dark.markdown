With the launch of ChatGPT, Large Language Models (LLMs) are shaking up our
whole society, rapidly altering the way we think, create and live. For
instance, the GPT integration in Bing has altered our approach to online
searching. While nascent LLMs have many advantages, new legal and ethical risks
are also emerging, stemming in particular from stochastic parrots and
hallucination. The EU is the first and foremost jurisdiction that has focused
on the regulation of AI models. However, the risks posed by the new LLMs are
likely to be underestimated by the emerging EU regulatory paradigm. Therefore,
this correspondence warns that the European AI regulatory paradigm must evolve
further to mitigate such risks.

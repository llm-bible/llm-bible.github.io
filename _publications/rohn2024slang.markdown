Language's complexity is evident in the rich tapestry of slang expressions,
often laden with humor and cultural nuances. This linguistic phenomenon has
become increasingly prevalent, especially in digital communication. However,
existing AI models, including ChatGPT-3.5, face challenges in comprehending
these nuances, particularly in Chinese slang. In this study, we present
DuanzAI, an innovative approach enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with
deep Chinese slang comprehension. Leveraging curated datasets and advanced
techniques, DuanzAI bridges the gap between human expression and AI
comprehension, enabling contextually relevant responses. Our experiments
contrast LLMs' performance with a custom Punchline Entity Recognition (PER)
system, integrating phonetic matching and pinyin2hanzi techniques. Applying
these insights, we developed ChatDAI, an advanced chatbot and released our code

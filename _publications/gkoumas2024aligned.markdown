The field of chemistry and Artificial Intelligence (AI) intersection is an area of active research that aims to accelerate scientific discovery. The integration of large language models (LLMs) with scientific modalities has shown significant promise in this endeavour. However challenges persist in effectively addressing training efficacy and the out-of-distribution problem particularly as existing approaches rely on larger models and datasets. In this context we focus on machine language-molecule translation and deploy a novel training approach called contrastive preference optimisation which avoids generating translations that are merely adequate but not perfect. To ensure generalisability and mitigate memorisation effects we conduct experiments using only 1037; of the data. Our results demonstrate that our models achieve up to a 3237; improvement compared to counterpart models. Finally we introduce a fine-grained domain-agnostic evaluation method to assess hallucination in LLMs and promote responsible use.

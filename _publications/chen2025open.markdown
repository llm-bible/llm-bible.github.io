The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed
human-computer interaction (HCI), but the interaction with LLMs is currently
mainly focused on text-based interactions, while other multi-model approaches
remain under-explored. This paper introduces VTutor, an open-source Software
Development Kit (SDK) that combines generative AI with advanced animation
technologies to create engaging, adaptable, and realistic APAs for human-AI
multi-media interactions. VTutor leverages LLMs for real-time personalized
feedback, advanced lip synchronization for natural speech alignment, and WebGL
rendering for seamless web integration. Supporting various 2D and 3D character
models, VTutor enables researchers and developers to design emotionally
resonant, contextually adaptive learning agents. This toolkit enhances learner
engagement, feedback receptivity, and human-AI interaction while promoting
trustworthy AI principles in education. VTutor sets a new standard for
next-generation APAs, offering an accessible, scalable solution for fostering
meaningful and immersive human-AI interaction experiences. The VTutor project
is open-sourced and welcomes community-driven contributions and showcases.

This paper provides an introductory survey to GPT-3. We cover some of the historical development behind this technology some of the key features of GPT-3 and discuss the machine learning model and the datasets used. We survey both academic and commercial efforts applying GPT-3 in diverse domains such as developing conversational AI chatbots software development creative work domain knowledge and business productivity. We discuss some of the challenges that GPT-3 faces such as the problems of training complexity bias and hallucination/incorrect answers. We also discuss the future research opportunities in this area.

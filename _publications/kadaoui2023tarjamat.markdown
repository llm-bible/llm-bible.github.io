Despite the purported multilingual proficiency of instruction-finetuned large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard the linguistic inclusivity of these models remains insufficiently explored. Considering this constraint we present a thorough assessment of Bard and ChatGPT (encompassing both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) regarding their machine translation proficiencies across ten varieties of Arabic. Our evaluation covers diverse Arabic varieties such as Classical Arabic (CA) Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and several country-level dialectal variants. Our analysis indicates that LLMs may encounter challenges with dialects for which minimal public datasets exist but on average are better translators of dialects than existing commercial systems. On CA and MSA instruction-tuned LLMs however trail behind commercial systems such as Google Translate. Finally we undertake a human-centric study to scrutinize the efficacy of the relatively recent model Bard in following human instructions during translation tasks. Our analysis reveals a circumscribed capability of Bard in aligning with human instructions in translation contexts. Collectively our findings underscore that prevailing LLMs remain far from inclusive with only limited ability to cater for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of diverse communities.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to build several automation and personalized question45;answering prototypes so far. However scaling such prototypes to robust products with minimized hallucinations or fake responses still remains an open challenge especially in niche data45;table heavy domains such as financial decision making. In this work we present a novel Langchain45;based framework that transforms data tables into hierarchical textual data chunks to enable a wide variety of actionable question answering. First the user45;queries are classified by intention followed by automated retrieval of the most relevant data chunks to generate customized LLM prompts per query. Next the custom prompts and their responses undergo multi45;metric scoring to assess for hallucinations and response confidence. The proposed system is optimized with user45;query intention classification advanced prompting data scaling capabilities and it achieves over 9037; confidence scores for a variety of user45;queries responses ranging from 123;What Where Why How predict trend anomalies exceptions125; that are crucial for financial decision making applications. The proposed data to answers framework can be extended to other analytical domains such as sales and payroll to ensure optimal hallucination control guardrails.

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) particularly conversational LLMs like ChatGPT have prompted changes in a range of fields including design. This study aims to examine the capabilities of ChatGPT in a human-centered design process. To this end a hypothetical design project was conducted where ChatGPT was utilized to generate personas simulate interviews with fictional users create new design ideas simulate usage scenarios and conversations between an imaginary prototype and fictional users and lastly evaluate user experience. The results show that ChatGPT effectively performed the tasks assigned to it as a designer user or product providing mostly appropriate responses. The study does however highlight some drawbacks such as forgotten information partial responses and a lack of output diversity. The paper explains the potential benefits and limitations of using conversational LLMs in design discusses its implications and suggests directions for future research in this rapidly evolving area.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in natural
language understanding and generation, leading to their widespread use in
applications such as chatbots and virtual assistants. However, existing LLM
frameworks face limitations in handling domain-specific data analytics tasks
with rich data structures. Moreover, they struggle with flexibility to meet
diverse user requirements. To address these issues, TaskWeaver is proposed as a
code-first framework for building LLM-powered autonomous agents. It converts
user requests into executable code and treats user-defined plugins as callable
functions. TaskWeaver provides support for rich data structures, flexible
plugin usage, and dynamic plugin selection, and leverages LLM coding
capabilities for complex logic. It also incorporates domain-specific knowledge
through examples and ensures the secure execution of generated code. TaskWeaver
offers a powerful and flexible framework for creating intelligent
conversational agents that can handle complex tasks and adapt to
domain-specific scenarios. The code is open sourced at
https://github.com/microsoft/TaskWeaver/.

Aligning large language models (LLMs) with deployment-specific requirements is critical but inherently imperfect. Despite extensive training, models remain susceptible to misalignment and adversarial inputs such as jailbreaks. Content moderation filters are commonly used as external safeguards, though they typically focus narrowly on safety. We introduce SGM (Specification-Guided Moderation), a flexible framework for training moderation filters grounded in user-defined specifications that go beyond standard safety concerns. SGM automates training data generation without relying on human-written examples, enabling scalable support for diverse, application-specific alignment goals. SGM-trained filters perform on par with state-of-the-art safety filters built on curated datasets, while supporting fine-grained and user-defined alignment control.

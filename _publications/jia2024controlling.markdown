Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown inspiring achievements in constructing autonomous agents that rely on language descriptions as inputs. However it remains unclear how well LLMs can function as few-shot or zero-shot embodied agents in dynamic interactive environments. To address this gap we introduce LangSuitE a versatile and simulation-free testbed featuring 6 representative embodied tasks in textual embodied worlds. Compared with previous LLM-based testbeds LangSuitE (i) offers adaptability to diverse environments without multiple simulation engines (ii) evaluates agents capacity to develop internalized world knowledge with embodied observations and (iii) allows easy customization of communication and action strategies. To address the embodiment challenge we devise a novel chain-of-thought (CoT) schema EmMem which summarizes embodied states w.r.t. history information. Comprehensive benchmark results illustrate challenges and insights of embodied planning. LangSuitE represents a significant step toward building embodied generalists in the context of language models.

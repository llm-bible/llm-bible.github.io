Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive corpora have shown remarkable
success in knowledge-intensive tasks. Yet, most of them rely on pre-stored
knowledge. Inducing new general knowledge from a specific environment and
performing reasoning with the acquired knowledge -- \textit\{situated inductive
reasoning\}, is crucial and challenging for machine intelligence. In this paper,
we design Mars, an interactive environment devised for situated inductive
reasoning. It introduces counter-commonsense game mechanisms by modifying
terrain, survival setting and task dependency while adhering to certain
principles. In Mars, agents need to actively interact with their surroundings,
derive useful rules and perform decision-making tasks in specific contexts. We
conduct experiments on various RL-based and LLM-based methods, finding that
they all struggle on this challenging situated inductive reasoning benchmark.
Furthermore, we explore \textit\{Induction from Reflection\}, where we instruct
agents to perform inductive reasoning from history trajectory. The superior
performance underscores the importance of inductive reasoning in Mars. Through
Mars, we aim to galvanize advancements in situated inductive reasoning and set
the stage for developing the next generation of AI systems that can reason in
an adaptive and context-sensitive way.

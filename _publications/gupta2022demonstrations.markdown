Building universal dialogue systems that operate across multiple domains/APIs and generalize to new ones with minimal overhead is a critical challenge. Recent works have leveraged natural language descriptions of schema elements to enable such systems; however descriptions only indirectly convey schema semantics. In this work we propose Show Dont Tell which prompts seq2seq models with a labeled example dialogue to show the semantics of schema elements rather than tell the model through descriptions. While requiring similar effort from service developers as generating descriptions we show that using short examples as schema representations with large language models results in state45;of45;the45;art performance on two popular dialogue state tracking benchmarks designed to measure zero45;shot generalization 45; the Schema45;Guided Dialogue dataset and the MultiWOZ leave45;one45;out benchmark.

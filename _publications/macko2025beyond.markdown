Increased sophistication of large language models (LLMs) and the consequent
quality of generated multilingual text raises concerns about potential
disinformation misuse. While humans struggle to distinguish LLM-generated
content from human-written texts, the scholarly debate about their impact
remains divided. Some argue that heightened fears are overblown due to natural
ecosystem limitations, while others contend that specific "longtail" contexts
face overlooked risks. Our study bridges this debate by providing the first
empirical evidence of LLM presence in the latest real-world disinformation
datasets, documenting the increase of machine-generated content following
ChatGPT's release, and revealing crucial patterns across languages, platforms,
and time periods.

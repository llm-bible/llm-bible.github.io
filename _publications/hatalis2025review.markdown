Agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
impressive capabilities in various tasks. Still, they face limitations in tasks
requiring specific, structured knowledge, flexibility, or accountable
decision-making. While agents are capable of perceiving their environments,
forming inferences, planning, and executing actions towards goals, they often
face issues such as hallucinations and lack of contextual memory across
interactions. This paper explores how Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), a strategy
that solves new problems by referencing past experiences, can be integrated
into LLM agent frameworks. This integration allows LLMs to leverage explicit
knowledge, enhancing their effectiveness. We systematically review the
theoretical foundations of these enhanced agents, identify critical framework
components, and formulate a mathematical model for the CBR processes of case
retrieval, adaptation, and learning. We also evaluate CBR-enhanced agents
against other methods like Chain-of-Thought reasoning and standard
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, analyzing their relative strengths. Moreover,
we explore how leveraging CBR's cognitive dimensions (including
self-reflection, introspection, and curiosity) via goal-driven autonomy
mechanisms can further enhance the LLM agent capabilities. Contributing to the
ongoing research on neuro-symbolic hybrid systems, this work posits CBR as a
viable technique for enhancing the reasoning skills and cognitive aspects of
autonomous LLM agents.

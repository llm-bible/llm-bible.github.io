Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains showcasing remarkable capabilities. Central to their success is the concept of prompting which guides model output generation. However manual prompt engineering is labor-intensive and domain-specific necessitating automated solutions. This paper introduces PromptWizard a novel framework leveraging LLMs to iteratively synthesize and refine prompts tailored to specific tasks. Unlike existing approaches PromptWizard optimizes both prompt instructions and in-context examples maximizing model performance. The framework iteratively refines prompts by mutating instructions and incorporating negative examples to deepen understanding and ensure diversity. It further enhances both instructions and examples with the aid of a critic synthesizing new instructions and examples enriched with detailed reasoning steps for optimal performance. PromptWizard offers several key features and capabilities including computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art approaches adaptability to scenarios with varying amounts of training data and effectiveness with smaller LLMs. Rigorous evaluation across 35 tasks on 8 datasets demonstrates PromptWizards superiority over existing prompt strategies showcasing its efficacy and scalability in prompt optimization.

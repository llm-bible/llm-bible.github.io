Benefiting from diverse instruction datasets contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) perform effectively as AI assistants in collaborating with humans. However LLMs still struggle to generate natural and colloquial responses in real45;world applications such as chatbots and psychological counseling that require more human45;like interactions. To address these limitations we introduce NICO a Natural Interactive COnversation dataset in Chinese. We first use GPT45;445;turbo to generate dialogue drafts and make them cover 20 daily45;life topics and 5 types of social interactions. Then we hire workers to revise these dialogues to ensure that they are free of grammatical errors and unnatural utterances. We define two dialogue45;level natural conversation tasks and two sentence45;level tasks for identifying and rewriting unnatural sentences. Multiple open45;source and closed45;source LLMs are tested and analyzed in detail. The experimental results highlight the challenge of the tasks and demonstrate how NICO can help foster the natural dialogue capabilities of LLMs. The dataset will be released.

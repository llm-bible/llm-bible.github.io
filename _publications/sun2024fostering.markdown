Benefiting from diverse instruction datasets, contemporary Large Language
Models (LLMs) perform effectively as AI assistants in collaborating with
humans. However, LLMs still struggle to generate natural and colloquial
responses in real-world applications such as chatbots and psychological
counseling that require more human-like interactions. To address these
limitations, we introduce NICO, a Natural Interactive COnversation dataset in
Chinese. We first use GPT-4-turbo to generate dialogue drafts and make them
cover 20 daily-life topics and 5 types of social interactions. Then, we hire
workers to revise these dialogues to ensure that they are free of grammatical
errors and unnatural utterances. We define two dialogue-level natural
conversation tasks and two sentence-level tasks for identifying and rewriting
unnatural sentences. Multiple open-source and closed-source LLMs are tested and
analyzed in detail. The experimental results highlight the challenge of the
tasks and demonstrate how NICO can help foster the natural dialogue
capabilities of LLMs. The dataset will be released.

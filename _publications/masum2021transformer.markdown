An AI chatbot provides an impressive response after learning from the trained dataset. In this decade most of the research work demonstrates that deep neural models superior to any other model. RNN model regularly used for determining the sequence-related problem like a question and it answers. This approach acquainted with everyone as seq2seq learning. In a seq2seq model mechanism it has encoder and decoder. The encoder embedded any input sequence and the decoder embedded output sequence. For reinforcing the seq2seq model performance attention mechanism added into the encoder and decoder. After that the transformer model has introduced itself as a high-performance model with multiple attention mechanism for solving the sequence-related dilemma. This model reduces training time compared with RNN based model and also achieved state-of-the-art performance for sequence transduction. In this research we applied the transformer model for Bengali general knowledge chatbot based on the Bengali general knowledge Question Answer (QA) dataset. It scores 85.0 BLEU on the applied QA data. To check the comparison of the transformer model performance we trained the seq2seq model with attention on our dataset that scores 23.5 BLEU.

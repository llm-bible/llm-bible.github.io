This research investigates the use of customized GPT models to enhance
prompting proficiency among architecture students when generating AI-driven
images. Prompt engineering is increasingly essential in architectural education
due to the widespread adoption of generative AI tools. This study utilized a
mixed-methods experimental design involving architecture students divided into
three distinct groups: a control group receiving no structured support, a
second group provided with structured prompting guides, and a third group
supported by both structured guides and interactive AI personas. Students
engaged in reverse engineering tasks, first guessing provided image prompts and
then generating their own prompts, aiming to boost critical thinking and
prompting skills. Variables examined included time spent prompting, word count,
prompt similarity, and concreteness. Quantitative analysis involved correlation
assessments between these variables and a one-way ANOVA to evaluate differences
across groups. While several correlations showed meaningful relationships, not
all were statistically significant. ANOVA results indicated statistically
significant improvements in word count, similarity, and concreteness,
especially in the group supported by AI personas and structured prompting
guides. Qualitative feedback complemented these findings, revealing enhanced
confidence and critical thinking skills in students. These results suggest
tailored GPT interactions substantially improve students' ability to
communicate architectural concepts clearly and effectively.

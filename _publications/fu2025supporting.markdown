With the rapid adoption of AI tools in learning contexts, it is vital to
understand how these systems shape users' reading processes and cognitive
engagement. We collected and analyzed text from 124 sessions with AI tools, in
which students used these tools to support them as they read assigned readings
for an undergraduate course. We categorized participants' prompts to AI
according to Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives -- Remembering,
Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating. Our results show that
``Analyzing'' and ``Evaluating'' are more prevalent in users' second and third
prompts within a single usage session, suggesting a shift toward higher-order
thinking. However, in reviewing users' engagement with AI tools over several
weeks, we found that users converge toward passive reading engagement over
time. Based on these results, we propose design implications for future AI
reading-support systems, including structured scaffolds for lower-level
cognitive tasks (e.g., recalling terms) and proactive prompts that encourage
higher-order thinking (e.g., analyzing, applying, evaluating). Additionally, we
advocate for adaptive, human-in-the-loop features that allow students and
instructors to tailor their reading experiences with AI, balancing efficiency
with enriched cognitive engagement. Our paper expands the dialogue on
integrating AI into academic reading, highlighting both its potential benefits
and challenges.

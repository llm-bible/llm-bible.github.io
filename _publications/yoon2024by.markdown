Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities across various domains. However utilizing LLMs for ubiquitous sensing applications remains challenging as existing text-prompt methods show significant performance degradation when handling long sensor data sequences. We propose a visual prompting approach for sensor data using multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). We design a visual prompt that directs MLLMs to utilize visualized sensor data alongside the target sensory task descriptions. Additionally we introduce a visualization generator that automates the creation of optimal visualizations tailored to a given sensory task eliminating the need for prior task-specific knowledge. We evaluated our approach on nine sensory tasks involving four sensing modalities achieving an average of 1037; higher accuracy than text-based prompts and reducing token costs by 15.8x. Our findings highlight the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of visual prompts with MLLMs for various sensory tasks.

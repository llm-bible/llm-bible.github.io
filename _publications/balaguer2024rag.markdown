There are two common ways in which developers are incorporating proprietary and domain45;specific data when building applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine45;Tuning. RAG augments the prompt with the external data while fine45;Tuning incorporates the additional knowledge into the model itself. However the pros and cons of both approaches are not well understood. In this paper we propose a pipeline for fine45;tuning and RAG and present the tradeoffs of both for multiple popular LLMs including Llama245;13B GPT45;3.5 and GPT45;4. Our pipeline consists of multiple stages including extracting information from PDFs generating questions and answers using them for fine45;tuning and leveraging GPT45;4 for evaluating the results. We propose metrics to assess the performance of different stages of the RAG and fine45;Tuning pipeline. We conduct an in45;depth study on an agricultural dataset. Agriculture as an industry has not seen much penetration of AI and we study a potentially disruptive application 45; what if we could provide location45;specific insights to a farmer Our results show the effectiveness of our dataset generation pipeline in capturing geographic45;specific knowledge and the quantitative and qualitative benefits of RAG and fine45;tuning. We see an accuracy increase of over 6 p.p. when fine45;tuning the model and this is cumulative with RAG which increases accuracy by 5 p.p. further. In one particular experiment we also demonstrate that the fine45;tuned model leverages information from across geographies to answer specific questions increasing answer similarity from 4737; to 7237;. Overall the results point to how systems built using LLMs can be adapted to respond and incorporate knowledge across a dimension that is critical for a specific industry paving the way for further applications of LLMs in other industrial domains.

Graph-to-text generation aims to generate fluent texts from graph-based data.
In this paper, we investigate two recently proposed pretrained language models
(PLMs) and analyze the impact of different task-adaptive pretraining strategies
for PLMs in graph-to-text generation. We present a study across three graph
domains: meaning representations, Wikipedia knowledge graphs (KGs) and
scientific KGs. We show that the PLMs BART and T5 achieve new state-of-the-art
results and that task-adaptive pretraining strategies improve their performance
even further. In particular, we report new state-of-the-art BLEU scores of
49.72 on LDC2017T10, 59.70 on WebNLG, and 25.66 on AGENDA datasets - a relative
improvement of 31.8%, 4.5%, and 42.4%, respectively. In an extensive analysis,
we identify possible reasons for the PLMs' success on graph-to-text tasks. We
find evidence that their knowledge about true facts helps them perform well
even when the input graph representation is reduced to a simple bag of node and
edge labels.

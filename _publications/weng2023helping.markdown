Large language models (LLMs) can be used as accessible and intelligent chatbots by constructing natural language queries and directly inputting the prompt into the large language model. However different prompt constructions often lead to uncertainty in the answers and thus make it hard to utilize the specific knowledge of LLMs (like ChatGPT). To alleviate this we use an interpretable structure to explain the prompt learning principle in LLMs which certificates that the effectiveness of language models is determined by position changes of the tasks related tokens. Therefore we propose MTPrompt a multi-dimensional task prompt learning method consisting based on task-related object summary and task description information. By automatically building and searching for appropriate prompts our proposed MTPrompt achieves the best results on few-shot samples setting and five different datasets. In addition we demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method in different experimental settings and ablation experiments. In interaction with large language models embedding more task-related information into prompts will make it easier to stimulate knowledge embedded in large language models.

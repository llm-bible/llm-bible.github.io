The emergence of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLMs),
has opened the door for student-centered and active learning methods like
project-based learning (PBL). However, PBL poses practical implementation
challenges for educators around project design and management, assessment, and
balancing student guidance with student autonomy. The following research
documents a co-design process with interdisciplinary K-12 teachers to explore
and address the current PBL challenges they face. Through teacher-driven
interviews, collaborative workshops, and iterative design of wireframes, we
gathered evidence for ways LLMs can support teachers in implementing
high-quality PBL pedagogy by automating routine tasks and enhancing
personalized learning. Teachers in the study advocated for supporting their
professional growth and augmenting their current roles without replacing them.
They also identified affordances and challenges around classroom integration,
including resource requirements and constraints, ethical concerns, and
potential immediate and long-term impacts. Drawing on these, we propose design
guidelines for future deployment of LLM tools in PBL.

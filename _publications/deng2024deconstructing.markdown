Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unparalleled success across diverse language modeling tasks in recent years. However this progress has also intensified ethical concerns impacting the deployment of LLMs in everyday contexts. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of ethical challenges associated with LLMs from longstanding issues such as copyright infringement systematic bias and data privacy to emerging problems like truthfulness and social norms. We critically analyze existing research aimed at understanding examining and mitigating these ethical risks. Our survey underscores integrating ethical standards and societal values into the development of LLMs thereby guiding the development of responsible and ethically aligned language models.

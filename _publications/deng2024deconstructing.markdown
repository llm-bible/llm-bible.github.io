Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved unparalleled success across
diverse language modeling tasks in recent years. However, this progress has
also intensified ethical concerns, impacting the deployment of LLMs in everyday
contexts. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of ethical challenges
associated with LLMs, from longstanding issues such as copyright infringement,
systematic bias, and data privacy, to emerging problems like truthfulness and
social norms. We critically analyze existing research aimed at understanding,
examining, and mitigating these ethical risks. Our survey underscores
integrating ethical standards and societal values into the development of LLMs,
thereby guiding the development of responsible and ethically aligned language
models.

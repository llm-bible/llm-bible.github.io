Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Although convenient for research and practical applications, open-source
LLMs with fewer parameters often suffer from severe hallucinations compared to
their larger counterparts. This paper focuses on measuring and reducing
hallucinations in BLOOM 7B, a representative of such weaker open-source LLMs
that are publicly available for research and commercial applications. We
introduce HaloCheck, a lightweight BlackBox knowledge-free framework designed
to quantify the severity of hallucinations in LLMs. Additionally, we explore
techniques like knowledge injection and teacher-student approaches to alleviate
hallucinations in low-parameter LLMs. Our experiments effectively demonstrate
the reduction of hallucinations in challenging domains for these LLMs.

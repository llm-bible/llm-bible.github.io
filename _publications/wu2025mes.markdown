Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves Large Language Models (LLMs) by
using external knowledge, but it struggles with precise entity information
retrieval. In this paper, we proposed MES-RAG framework, which enhances
entity-specific query handling and provides accurate, secure, and consistent
responses. MES-RAG introduces proactive security measures that ensure system
integrity by applying protections prior to data access. Additionally, the
system supports real-time multi-modal outputs, including text, images, audio,
and video, seamlessly integrating into existing RAG architectures. Experimental
results demonstrate that MES-RAG significantly improves both accuracy and
recall, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing the security and utility of
question-answering, increasing accuracy to 0.83 (+0.25) on targeted task. Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/wpydcr/MES-RAG.

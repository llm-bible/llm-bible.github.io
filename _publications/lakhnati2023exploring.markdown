In a rapidly evolving digital landscape autonomous tools and robots are
becoming commonplace. Recognizing the significance of this development, this
paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Generative
pre-trained transformer (GPT) into human-robot teaming environments to
facilitate variable autonomy through the means of verbal human-robot
communication. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for such a
GPT-powered multi-robot testbed environment, based on a Unity Virtual Reality
(VR) setting. This system allows users to interact with robot agents through
natural language, each powered by individual GPT cores. By means of OpenAI's
function calling, we bridge the gap between unstructured natural language input
and structure robot actions. A user study with 12 participants explores the
effectiveness of GPT-4 and, more importantly, user strategies when being given
the opportunity to converse in natural language within a multi-robot
environment. Our findings suggest that users may have preconceived expectations
on how to converse with robots and seldom try to explore the actual language
and cognitive capabilities of their robot collaborators. Still, those users who
did explore where able to benefit from a much more natural flow of
communication and human-like back-and-forth. We provide a set of lessons
learned for future research and technical implementations of similar systems.

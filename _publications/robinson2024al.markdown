Dialectal Arabic (DA) varieties are under-served by language technologies,
particularly large language models (LLMs). This trend threatens to exacerbate
existing social inequalities and limits LLM applications, yet the research
community lacks operationalized performance measurements in DA. We present a
framework that comprehensively assesses LLMs' DA modeling capabilities across
four dimensions: fidelity, understanding, quality, and diglossia. We evaluate
nine LLMs in eight DA varieties and provide practical recommendations. Our
evaluation suggests that LLMs do not produce DA as well as they understand it,
not because their DA fluency is poor, but because they are reluctant to
generate DA. Further analysis suggests that current post-training can
contribute to bias against DA, that few-shot examples can overcome this
deficiency, and that otherwise no measurable features of input text correlate
well with LLM DA performance.

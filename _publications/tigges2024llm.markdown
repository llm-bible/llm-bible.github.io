Most currently deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo continuous training or additional finetuning. By contrast most research into LLMs internal mechanisms focuses on models at one snapshot in time (the end of pre-training) raising the question of whether their results generalize to real-world settings. Existing studies of mechanisms over time focus on encoder-only or toy models which differ significantly from most deployed models. In this study we track how model mechanisms operationalized as circuits emerge and evolve across 300 billion tokens of training in decoder-only LLMs in models ranging from 70 million to 2.8 billion parameters. We find that task abilities and the functional components that support them emerge consistently at similar token counts across scale. Moreover although such components may be implemented by different attention heads over time the overarching algorithm that they implement remains. Surprisingly both these algorithms and the types of components involved therein can replicate across model scale. These results suggest that circuit analyses conducted on small models at the end of pre-training can provide insights that still apply after additional pre-training and over model scale.

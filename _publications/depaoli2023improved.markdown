This draft paper presents a workflow for creating User Personas with Large Language Models using the results of a Thematic Analysis of qualitative interviews. The proposed workflow uses improved prompting and a larger pool of Themes compared to previous work conducted by the author for the same task. This is possible due to the capabilities of a recently released LLM which allows the processing of 16 thousand tokens (GPT3.5-Turbo-16k) and also due to the possibility to offer a refined prompting for the creation of Personas. The paper offers details of performing Phase 2 and 3 of Thematic Analysis and then discusses the improved workflow for creating Personas. The paper also offers some reflections on the relationship between the proposed process and existing approaches to Personas such as the data-driven and qualitative Personas. Moreover the paper offers reflections on the capacity of LLMs to capture user behaviours and personality traits from the underlying dataset of qualitative interviews used for the analysis.

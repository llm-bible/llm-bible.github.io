This paper explores the effectiveness of using large language models (LLMs) for personalized movie recommendations from users perspectives in an online field experiment. Our study involves a combination of between-subject prompt and historic consumption assessments along with within-subject recommendation scenario evaluations. By examining conversation and survey response data from 160 active users we find that LLMs offer strong recommendation explainability but lack overall personalization diversity and user trust. Our results also indicate that different personalized prompting techniques do not significantly affect user-perceived recommendation quality but the number of movies a user has watched plays a more significant role. Furthermore LLMs show a greater ability to recommend lesser-known or niche movies. Through qualitative analysis we identify key conversational patterns linked to positive and negative user interaction experiences and conclude that providing personal context and examples is crucial for obtaining high-quality recommendations from LLMs.

This paper introduces a new hyper45;parameter for Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) systems called Context Window Utilization. RAG systems enhance generative models by incorporating relevant information retrieved from external knowledge bases improving the factual accuracy and contextual relevance of generated responses. The size of the text chunks retrieved and processed is a critical factor influencing RAG performance. This study aims to identify the optimal chunk size that maximizes answer generation quality. Through systematic experimentation we analyze the effects of varying chunk sizes on the efficiency and effectiveness of RAG frameworks. Our findings reveal that an optimal chunk size balances the trade45;off between providing sufficient context and minimizing irrelevant information. These insights are crucial for enhancing the design and implementation of RAG systems underscoring the importance of selecting an appropriate chunk size to achieve superior performance.

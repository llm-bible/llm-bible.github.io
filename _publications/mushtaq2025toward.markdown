As large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama 3 become integral to
educational contexts, concerns are mounting over the cultural biases, power
imbalances, and ethical limitations embedded within these technologies. Though
generative AI tools aim to enhance learning experiences, they often reflect
values rooted in Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic
(WEIRD) cultural paradigms, potentially sidelining diverse global perspectives.
This paper proposes a framework to assess and mitigate cultural bias within
LLMs through the lens of applied multiplexity. Multiplexity, inspired by
Senturk et al. and rooted in Islamic and other wisdom traditions, emphasizes
the coexistence of diverse cultural viewpoints, supporting a multi-layered
epistemology that integrates both empirical sciences and normative values. Our
analysis reveals that LLMs frequently exhibit cultural polarization, with
biases appearing in both overt responses and subtle contextual cues. To address
inherent biases and incorporate multiplexity in LLMs, we propose two
strategies: \textit\{Contextually-Implemented Multiplex LLMs\}, which embed
multiplex principles directly into the system prompt, influencing LLM outputs
at a foundational level and independent of individual prompts, and
\textit\{Multi-Agent System (MAS)-Implemented Multiplex LLMs\}, where multiple
LLM agents, each representing distinct cultural viewpoints, collaboratively
generate a balanced, synthesized response. Our findings demonstrate that as
mitigation strategies evolve from contextual prompting to MAS-implementation,
cultural inclusivity markedly improves, evidenced by a significant rise in the
Perspectives Distribution Score (PDS) and a PDS Entropy increase from 3.25% at
baseline to 98% with the MAS-Implemented Multiplex LLMs. Sentiment analysis
further shows a shift towards positive sentiment across cultures,...

In this paper, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework called MATCHA
for conversational recommendation system, leveraging large language models
(LLMs) to enhance personalization and user engagement. Users can request
recommendations via free-form text and receive curated lists aligned with their
interests, preferences, and constraints. Our system introduces specialized
agents for intent analysis, candidate generation, ranking, re-ranking,
explainability, and safeguards. These agents collaboratively improve
recommendations accuracy, diversity, and safety. On eight metrics, our model
achieves superior or comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art.
Through comparisons with six baseline models, our approach addresses key
challenges in conversational recommendation systems for game recommendations,
including: (1) handling complex, user-specific requests, (2) enhancing
personalization through multi-agent collaboration, (3) empirical evaluation and
deployment, and (4) ensuring safe and trustworthy interactions.

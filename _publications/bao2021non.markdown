Non45;autoregressive Transformer is a promising text generation model. However current non45;autoregressive models still fall behind their autoregressive counterparts in translation quality. We attribute this accuracy gap to the lack of dependency modeling among decoder inputs. In this paper we propose CNAT which learns implicitly categorical codes as latent variables into the non45;autoregressive decoding. The interaction among these categorical codes remedies the missing dependencies and improves the model capacity. Experiment results show that our model achieves comparable or better performance in machine translation tasks compared with several strong baselines.

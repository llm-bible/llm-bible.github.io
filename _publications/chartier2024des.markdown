Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Bard have revolutionized information retrieval and captivated the audience with their ability to generate custom responses in record time regardless of the topic. In this article we assess the capabilities of various LLMs in producing reliable comprehensive and sufficiently relevant responses about historical facts in French. To achieve this we constructed a testbed comprising numerous history-related questions of varying types themes and levels of difficulty. Our evaluation of responses from ten selected LLMs reveals numerous shortcomings in both substance and form. Beyond an overall insufficient accuracy rate we highlight uneven treatment of the French language as well as issues related to verbosity and inconsistency in the responses provided by LLMs.

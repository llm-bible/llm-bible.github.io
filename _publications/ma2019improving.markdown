Taking an answer and its context as input sequence-to-sequence models have made considerable progress on question generation. However we observe that these approaches often generate wrong question words or keywords and copy answer-irrelevant words from the input. We believe that lacking global question semantics and exploiting answer position-awareness not well are the key root causes. In this paper we propose a neural question generation model with two concrete modules sentence-level semantic matching and answer position inferring. Further we enhance the initial state of the decoder by leveraging the answer-aware gated fusion mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on SQuAD and MARCO datasets. Owing to its generality our work also improves the existing models significantly.

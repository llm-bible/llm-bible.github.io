This study investigates the application of large language models,
specifically GPT-4, to enhance programming education. The research outlines the
design of a web application that uses GPT-4 to provide feedback on programming
tasks, without giving away the solution. A web application for working on
programming tasks was developed for the study and evaluated with 51 students
over the course of one semester. The results show that most of the feedback
generated by GPT-4 effectively addressed code errors. However, challenges with
incorrect suggestions and hallucinated issues indicate the need for further
improvements.

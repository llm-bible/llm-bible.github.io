Conversational recommender systems (CRS) enable users to articulate their preferences and provide feedback through natural language. With the advent of large language models (LLMs) the potential to enhance user engagement with CRS and augment the recommendation process with LLM-generated content has received increasing attention. However the efficacy of LLM-powered CRS is contingent upon the use of prompts and the subjective perception of recommendation quality can differ across various recommendation domains. Therefore we have developed a ChatGPT-based CRS to investigate the impact of these two factors prompt guidance (PG) and recommendation domain (RD) on the overall user experience of the system. We conducted an online empirical study (N = 100) by employing a mixed-method approach that utilized a between-subjects design for the variable of PG (with vs. without) and a within-subjects design for RD (book recommendations vs. job recommendations). The findings reveal that PG can substantially enhance the systems explainability adaptability perceived ease of use and transparency. Moreover users are inclined to perceive a greater sense of novelty and demonstrate a higher propensity to engage with and try recommended items in the context of book recommendations as opposed to job recommendations. Furthermore the influence of PG on certain user experience metrics and interactive behaviors appears to be modulated by the recommendation domain as evidenced by the interaction effects between the two examined factors. This work contributes to the user-centered evaluation of ChatGPT-based CRS by investigating two prominent factors and offers practical design guidance.

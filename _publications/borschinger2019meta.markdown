We investigate a framework for machine reading inspired by real world information-seeking problems where a meta question answering system interacts with a black box environment. The environment encapsulates a competitive machine reader based on BERT providing candidate answers to questions and possibly some context. To validate the realism of our formulation we ask humans to play the role of a meta-answerer. With just a small snippet of text around an answer humans can outperform the machine reader improving recall. Similarly a simple machine meta-answerer outperforms the environment improving both precision and recall on the Natural Questions dataset. The system relies on joint training of answer scoring and the selection of conditioning information.

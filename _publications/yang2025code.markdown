In large language models (LLMs), code and reasoning reinforce each other:
code offers an abstract, modular, and logic-driven structure that supports
reasoning, while reasoning translates high-level goals into smaller, executable
steps that drive more advanced code intelligence. In this study, we examine how
code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides
verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime
validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code
intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to
address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging.
Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to
strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.

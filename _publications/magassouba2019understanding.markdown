In this paper, we address multimodal language understanding for unconstrained
fetching instruction in domestic service robots context. A typical fetching
instruction such as "Bring me the yellow toy from the white shelf" requires to
infer the user intention, that is what object (target) to fetch and from where
(source). To solve the task, we propose a Multimodal Target-source Classifier
Model (MTCM), which predicts the region-wise likelihood of target and source
candidates in the scene. Unlike other methods, MTCM can handle regionwise
classification based on linguistic and visual features. We evaluated our
approach that outperformed the state-of-the-art method on a standard data set.
In addition, we extended MTCM with Generative Adversarial Nets (MTCM-GAN), and
enabled simultaneous data augmentation and classification.

This workshop paper presents a critical examination of the integration of
Generative AI (Gen AI) into the academic writing process, focusing on the use
of AI as a collaborative tool. It contrasts the performance and interaction of
two AI models, Gemini and ChatGPT, through a collaborative inquiry approach
where researchers engage in facilitated sessions to design prompts that elicit
specific AI responses for crafting research outlines. This case study
highlights the importance of prompt design, output analysis, and recognizing
the AI's limitations to ensure responsible and effective AI integration in
scholarly work. Preliminary findings suggest that prompt variation
significantly affects output quality and reveals distinct capabilities and
constraints of each model. The paper contributes to the field of Human-Computer
Interaction by exploring effective prompt strategies and providing a
comparative analysis of Gen AI models, ultimately aiming to enhance AI-assisted
academic writing and prompt a deeper dialogue within the HCI community.

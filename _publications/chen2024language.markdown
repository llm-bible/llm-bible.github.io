In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence Large Language Models (LLMs) play a crucial role due to their advanced text processing and generation abilities. This study introduces a new strategy aimed at harnessing on45;device LLMs in invoking software APIs. We meticulously compile a dataset derived from software API documentation and apply fine45;tuning to LLMs with capacities of 2B 3B and 7B parameters specifically to enhance their proficiency in software API interactions. Our approach concentrates on refining the models grasp of API structures and syntax significantly enhancing the accuracy of API function calls. Additionally we propose textit123;conditional masking125; techniques to ensure outputs in the desired formats and reduce error rates while maintaining inference speeds. We also propose a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in API interactions establishing a foundation for subsequent research. Octopus the fine45;tuned model is proved to have better performance than GPT45;4 for the software APIs calling. This research aims to advance automated software development and API integration representing substantial progress in aligning LLM capabilities with the demands of practical software engineering applications.

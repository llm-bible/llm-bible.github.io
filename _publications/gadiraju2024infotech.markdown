This pilot study presents the development of the InfoTech Assistant, a
domain-specific, multimodal chatbot engineered to address queries in bridge
evaluation and infrastructure technology. By integrating web data scraping,
large language models (LLMs), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the
InfoTech Assistant provides accurate and contextually relevant responses. Data,
including textual descriptions and images, are sourced from publicly available
documents on the InfoTechnology website and organized in JSON format to
facilitate efficient querying. The architecture of the system includes an
HTML-based interface and a Flask back end connected to the Llama 3.1 model via
LLM Studio. Evaluation results show approximately 95 percent accuracy on
domain-specific tasks, with high similarity scores confirming the quality of
response matching. This RAG-enhanced setup enables the InfoTech Assistant to
handle complex, multimodal queries, offering both textual and visual
information in its responses. The InfoTech Assistant demonstrates strong
potential as a dependable tool for infrastructure professionals, delivering
high accuracy and relevance in its domain-specific outputs.

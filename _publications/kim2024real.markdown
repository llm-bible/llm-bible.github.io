Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of conversational agents making them applicable to various fields (e.g. education). Despite their progress the evaluation of the agents often overlooks the complexities of real45;world conversations such as real45;time interactions multi45;party dialogues and extended contextual dependencies. To bridge this gap we introduce DialSim a real45;time dialogue simulator. In this simulator an agent is assigned the role of a character from popular TV shows requiring it to respond to spontaneous questions using past dialogue information and to distinguish between known and unknown information. Key features of DialSim include evaluating the agents ability to respond within a reasonable time limit handling long45;term multi45;party dialogues and managing adversarial settings (e.g. swap character names) to challenge the agents reliance on pre45;trained knowledge. We utilized this simulator to evaluate the latest conversational agents and analyze their limitations. Our experiments highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of these agents providing valuable insights for future improvements in the field of conversational AI. DialSim is available at https://github.com/jiho283/Simulator.

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
enhanced the capabilities of conversation systems, making them applicable to
various fields (e.g., education). Despite their progress, the evaluation of the
systems often overlooks the complexities of real-world conversations, such as
real-time interactions, multi-party dialogues, and extended contextual
dependencies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DialSim, a real-time dialogue
simulator. In this simulator, a conversation system is assigned the role of a
character from popular TV shows, requiring it to respond to spontaneous
questions using past dialogue information and to distinguish between known and
unknown information. Key features of DialSim include assessing the system's
ability to respond within a reasonable time limit, handling long-term
multi-party dialogues, and evaluating performance under randomized questioning
with LongDialQA, a novel, high-quality question-answering dataset. Our
experiments using DialSim reveal the strengths and weaknesses of the latest
conversation systems, offering valuable insights for future advancements in
conversational AI. DialSim is available at https://dialsim.github.io/.

Most existing works on dialog systems only consider conversation content
while neglecting the personality of the user the bot is interacting with, which
begets several unsolved issues. In this paper, we present a personalized
end-to-end model in an attempt to leverage personalization in goal-oriented
dialogs. We first introduce a Profile Model which encodes user profiles into
distributed embeddings and refers to conversation history from other similar
users. Then a Preference Model captures user preferences over knowledge base
entities to handle the ambiguity in user requests. The two models are combined
into the Personalized MemN2N. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves
qualitative performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. As for
human evaluation, it also outperforms other approaches in terms of task
completion rate and user satisfaction.

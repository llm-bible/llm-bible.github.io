Persuasion plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications from health intervention to the promotion of social good. Persuasive chatbots can accelerate the positive effects of persuasion in such applications. Existing methods rely on fine45;tuning persuasive chatbots with task45;specific training data which is costly if not infeasible to collect. To address this issue we propose a method to leverage the generalizability and inherent persuasive abilities of large language models (LLMs) in creating effective and truthful persuasive chatbot for any given domain in a zero45;shot manner. Unlike previous studies which used pre45;defined persuasion strategies our method first uses an LLM to generate responses then extracts the strategies used on the fly and replaces any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the strategies. We applied our chatbot PersuaBot to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills donation solicitation recommendations and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero45;shot approach is more persuasive than prior work while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state45;of45;the45;art knowledge45;oriented chatbots. Our study demonstrated that when persuasive chatbots are employed responsibly for social good it is an enabler of positive individual and social change.

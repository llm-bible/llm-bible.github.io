LLMs are computationally expensive to pre45;train due to their large scale. Model growth emerges as a promising approach by leveraging smaller models to accelerate the training of larger ones. However the viability of these model growth methods in efficient LLM pre45;training remains underexplored. This work identifies three critical underline123;textit123;O125;125;bstacles (textit123;O125;1) lack of comprehensive evaluation (textit123;O125;2) untested viability for scaling and (textit123;O125;3) lack of empirical guidelines. To tackle textit123;O125;1 we summarize existing approaches into four atomic growth operators and systematically evaluate them in a standardized LLM pre45;training setting. Our findings reveal that a depthwise stacking operator called G95;123;text123;stack125;125; exhibits remarkable acceleration in training leading to decreased loss and improved overall performance on eight standard NLP benchmarks compared to strong baselines. Motivated by these promising results we conduct extensive experiments to delve deeper into G95;123;text123;stack125;125; to address textit123;O125;2 and textit123;O125;3. For textit123;O125;2 (untested scalability) our study shows that G95;123;text123;stack125;125; is scalable and consistently performs well with experiments up to 7B LLMs after growth and pre45;training LLMs with 750B tokens. For example compared to a conventionally trained 7B model using 300B tokens our G95;123;text123;stack125;125; model converges to the same loss with 194B tokens resulting in a 54.637; speedup. We further address textit123;O125;3 (lack of empirical guidelines) by formalizing guidelines to determine growth timing and growth factor for G95;123;text123;stack125;125; making it practical in general LLM pre45;training. We also provide in45;depth discussions and comprehensive ablation studies of G95;123;text123;stack125;125;. Our code and pre45;trained model are available at href123;https://llm&#45;stacking.github.io/&#125;&#123;https://llm&#45;stacking.github.io/&#125;$.

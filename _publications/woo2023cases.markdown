ChatGPT is a state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) chatbot. Although it has potential to support English as a foreign language (EFL) students writing to effectively collaborate with it a student must learn to engineer prompts that is the skill of crafting appropriate instructions so that ChatGPT produces desired outputs. However writing an appropriate prompt for ChatGPT is not straightforward for non45;technical users who suffer a trial45;and45;error process. This paper examines the content of EFL students ChatGPT prompts when completing a writing task and explores patterns in the quality and quantity of the prompts. The data come from iPad screen recordings of secondary school EFL students who used ChatGPT and other SOTA chatbots for the first time to complete the same writing task. The paper presents a case study of four distinct pathways that illustrate the trial45;and45;error process and show different combinations of prompt content and quantity. The cases contribute evidence for the need to provide prompt engineering education in the context of the EFL writing classroom if students are to move beyond an individual trial45;and45;error process learning a greater variety of prompt content and more sophisticated prompts to support their writing.

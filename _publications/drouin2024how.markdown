We study the use of large language model-based agents for interacting with software via web browsers. Unlike prior work we focus on measuring the agents ability to perform tasks that span the typical daily work of knowledge workers utilizing enterprise software systems. To this end we propose WorkArena a remote-hosted benchmark of 33 tasks based on the widely-used ServiceNow platform. We also introduce BrowserGym an environment for the design and evaluation of such agents offering a rich set of actions as well as multimodal observations. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current agents show promise on WorkArena there remains a considerable gap towards achieving full task automation. Notably our analysis uncovers a significant performance disparity between open and closed-source LLMs highlighting a critical area for future exploration and development in the field.

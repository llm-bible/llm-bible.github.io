This paper presents the overview of the development and fine-tuning of large
language models (LLMs) designed specifically for answering medical questions.
We are mainly improving the accuracy and efficiency of providing reliable
answers to medical queries. In our approach, we have two stages, prediction of
a specific label for the received medical question and then providing a
predefined answer for this label. Various models such as RoBERTa and BERT were
examined and evaluated based on their ability. The models are trained using the
datasets derived from 6,800 samples that were scraped from Healthline. com with
additional synthetic data. For evaluation, we conducted a comparative study
using 5-fold cross-validation. For accessing performance we used metrics like,
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score and also recorded the training time.
The performance of the models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. The
LoRA Roberta-large model achieved an accuracy of 78.47%, precision of 72.91%,
recall of 76.95%, and an F1 score of 73.56%. The Roberta-base model
demonstrated high performance with an accuracy of 99.87%, precision of 99.81%,
recall of 99.86%, and an F1 score of 99.82%. The Bert Uncased model showed
strong results with an accuracy of 95.85%, precision of 94.42%, recall of
95.58%, and an F1 score of 94.72%. Lastly, the Bert Large Uncased model
achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
score of 100%. The results obtained have helped indicate the capability of the
models in classifying the medical questions and generating accurate answers in
the prescription of improved health-related AI solutions.

Two techniques provide the fabric of the Cambridge University Engineering Departments (CUED) entry to the WMT19 evaluation campaign elastic weight consolidation (EWC) and different forms of language modelling (LMs). We report substantial gains by fine-tuning very strong baselines on former WMT test sets using a combination of checkpoint averaging and EWC. A sentence-level Transformer LM and a document-level LM based on a modified Transformer architecture yield further gains. As in previous years we also extract n-gram probabilities from SMT lattices which can be seen as a source-conditioned n-gram LM.

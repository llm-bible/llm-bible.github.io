Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN45;CE) represents a frontier in embodied AI demanding agents to navigate freely in unbounded 3D spaces solely guided by natural language instructions. This task introduces distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension spatial reasoning and decision45;making. To address these challenges we introduce Cog45;GA a generative agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN45;CE tasks. Cog45;GA employs a dual45;pronged strategy to emulate human45;like cognitive processes. Firstly it constructs a cognitive map integrating temporal spatial and semantic elements thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory within LLMs. Secondly Cog45;GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual45;channel scene description categorizing environmental cues into what and where streams as the brain. This segregation enhances the agents attentional focus enabling it to discern pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation experiences facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive evaluations conducted on VLN45;CE benchmarks validate Cog45;GAs state45;of45;the45;art performance and ability to simulate human45;like navigation behaviors. This research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and interpretable VLN45;CE agents.

Advancements in natural language generation (NLG) and large language models (LLMs) have led to proficient text generation in various tasks. However integrating intricate constraints into neural text generation due to LLMs opacity remains challenging. This study investigates constrained text generation for LLMs where predefined constraints are applied during LLMs generation process. Our research mainly focuses on mainstream open45;source LLMs categorizing constraints into lexical structural and relation45;based types. We also present various benchmarks to facilitate fair evaluation. The study addresses some key research questions including evaluating understanding and improving constrained text generation for LLMs. Results illuminate LLMs capacity and deficiency to incorporate constraints and provide insights for future developments in constrained text generation. Codes and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

As chatbots become increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, designing
systems that accommodate diverse user populations is crucial for fostering
trust, engagement, and inclusivity. This study investigates the ability of
contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate African American
Vernacular English (AAVE) and evaluates the impact of AAVE usage on user
experiences in chatbot applications. We analyze the performance of three LLM
families (Llama, GPT, and Claude) in producing AAVE-like utterances at varying
dialect intensities and assess user preferences across multiple domains,
including healthcare and education. Despite LLMs' proficiency in generating
AAVE-like language, findings indicate that AAVE-speaking users prefer Standard
American English (SAE) chatbots, with higher levels of AAVE correlating with
lower ratings for a variety of characteristics, including chatbot
trustworthiness and role appropriateness. These results highlight the
complexities of creating inclusive AI systems and underscore the need for
further exploration of diversity to enhance human-computer interactions.

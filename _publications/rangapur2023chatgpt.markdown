Large language models have gained considerable interest for their impressive performance on various tasks. Among these models ChatGPT developed by OpenAI has become extremely popular among early adopters who even regard it as a disruptive technology in many fields like customer service education healthcare and finance. It is essential to comprehend the opinions of these initial users as it can provide valuable insights into the potential strengths weaknesses and success or failure of the technology in different areas. This research examines the responses generated by ChatGPT from different Conversational QA corpora. The study employed BERT similarity scores to compare these responses with correct answers and obtain Natural Language Inference(NLI) labels. Evaluation scores were also computed and compared to determine the overall performance of GPT-3 GPT-4. Additionally the study identified instances where ChatGPT provided incorrect answers to questions providing insights into areas where the model may be prone to error.

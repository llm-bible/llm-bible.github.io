Mental health issues are worsening in today's competitive society, such as
depression and anxiety. Traditional healings like counseling and chatbots fail
to engage effectively, they often provide generic responses lacking emotional
depth. Although large language models (LLMs) have the potential to create more
human-like interactions, they still struggle to capture subtle emotions. This
requires LLMs to be equipped with human-like adaptability and warmth. To fill
this gap, we propose the MIND (Multi-agent INner Dialogue), a novel paradigm
that provides more immersive psychological healing environments. Considering
the strong generative and role-playing ability of LLM agents, we predefine an
interactive healing framework and assign LLM agents different roles within the
framework to engage in interactive inner dialogues with users, thereby
providing an immersive healing experience. We conduct extensive human
experiments in various real-world healing dimensions, and find that MIND
provides a more user-friendly experience than traditional paradigms. This
demonstrates that MIND effectively leverages the significant potential of LLMs
in psychological healing.

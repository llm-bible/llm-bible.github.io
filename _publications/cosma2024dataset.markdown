Recently large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful and have become capable of solving a plethora of tasks through proper instructions in natural language. However the vast majority of testing suites assume that the instructions are written in English the de facto prompting language. Code intelligence and problem solving still remain a difficult task even for the most advanced LLMs. Currently there are no datasets to measure the generalization power for code-generation models in a language other than English. In this work we present RoCode a competitive programming dataset consisting of 2642 problems written in Romanian 11k solutions in C C++ and Python and comprehensive testing suites for each problem. The purpose of RoCode is to provide a benchmark for evaluating the code intelligence of language models trained on Romanian / multilingual text as well as a fine-tuning set for pretrained Romanian models. Through our results and review of related works we argue for the need to develop code models for languages other than English.

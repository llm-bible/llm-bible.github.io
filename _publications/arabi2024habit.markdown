This paper presents the iterative development of Habit Coach, a GPT-based
chatbot designed to support users in habit change through personalized
interaction. Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the
chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables
behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model
(GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to
tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and
narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was
the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction
behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative
knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational
goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior,
as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and
contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of
relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly
in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this
issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the
chatbot's interaction strategies, and improving its overall effectiveness. In
the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five
consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report
Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the
intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These
results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective,
personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems.

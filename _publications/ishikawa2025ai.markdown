The human-level performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across various
tasks has raised expectations for the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
to possess emotions someday. To explore the capability of current LLMs to
express emotions in their outputs, we conducted an experiment using several
LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Meta Llama3, and Cohere Command R+) to
role-play as agents answering questions with specified emotional states. We
defined the emotional states using Russell's Circumplex model, a
well-established framework that characterizes emotions along the
sleepy-activated (arousal) and pleasure-displeasure (valence) axes. We chose
this model for its simplicity, utilizing two continuous parameters, which
allows for better controllability in applications involving continuous changes
in emotional states. The responses generated were evaluated using a sentiment
analysis model, independent of the LLMs, trained on the GoEmotions dataset. The
evaluation showed that the emotional states of the generated answers were
consistent with the specifications, demonstrating the LLMs' capability for
emotional expression. This indicates the potential for LLM-based AI agents to
simulate emotions, opening up a wide range of applications for emotion-based
interactions, such as advisors or consultants who can provide advice or
opinions with a personal touch.

Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) face significant
deployment challenges in resource-constrained environments, particularly for
specialized domains and less-common languages. This paper presents Tox-chat, a
Korean chemical toxicity information agent devised within these limitations. We
propose two key innovations: a context-efficient architecture that reduces
token consumption through hierarchical section search, and a scenario-based
dialogue generation methodology that effectively distills tool-using
capabilities from larger models. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our
fine-tuned 8B parameter model substantially outperforms both untuned models and
baseline approaches, in terms of DB faithfulness and preference. Our work
offers valuable insights for researchers developing domain-specific language
agents under practical constraints.

LLMs have demonstrated commendable performance across diverse domains. Nevertheless formulating high-quality prompts to instruct LLMs proficiently poses a challenge for non-AI experts. Existing research in prompt engineering suggests somewhat scattered optimization principles and designs empirically dependent prompt optimizers. Unfortunately these endeavors lack a structured design template incurring high learning costs and resulting in low reusability. In addition it is not conducive to the iterative updating of prompts. Inspired by structured reusable programming languages we propose LangGPT a dual-layer prompt design framework as the programming language for LLMs. LangGPT has an easy-to-learn normative structure and provides an extended structure for migration and reuse. Experiments illustrate that LangGPT significantly enhances the performance of LLMs. Moreover the case study shows that LangGPT leads LLMs to generate higher-quality responses. Furthermore we analyzed the ease of use and reusability of LangGPT through a user survey in our online community.

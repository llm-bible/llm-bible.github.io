In today's society, we are becoming increasingly dependent on software
systems. However, we also constantly witness the negative impacts of buggy
software. Program synthesis aims to improve software correctness by
automatically generating the program given an outline of the expected behavior.
For decades, program synthesis has been an active research field, with recent
approaches looking to incorporate Large Language Models to help generate code.
This paper explores the concept of LLM4TDD, where we guide Large Language
Models to generate code iteratively using a test-driven development
methodology. We conduct an empirical evaluation using ChatGPT and coding
problems from LeetCode to investigate the impact of different test, prompt and
problem attributes on the efficacy of LLM4TDD.

Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) have significantly enhanced adult literacy training a key factor for societal participation employment opportunities and lifelong learning. Our study investigates the application of advanced AI models including Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT45;4 for predicting learning performance in adult literacy programs in ITSs. This research is motivated by the potential of LLMs to predict learning performance based on its inherent reasoning and computational capabilities. By using reading comprehension datasets from the ITS AutoTutor we evaluate the predictive capabilities of GPT45;4 versus traditional machine learning methods in predicting learning performance through five45;fold cross45;validation techniques. Our findings show that the GPT45;4 presents the competitive predictive abilities with traditional machine learning methods such as Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Performance Factor Analysis Sparse Factor Analysis Lite (SPARFA45;Lite) tensor factorization and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). While XGBoost (trained on local machine) outperforms GPT45;4 in predictive accuracy GPT45;445;selected XGBoost and its subsequent tuning on the GPT45;4 platform demonstrates superior performance compared to local machine execution. Moreover our investigation into hyper45;parameter tuning by GPT45;4 versus grid45;search suggests comparable performance albeit with less stability in the automated approach using XGBoost as the case study. Our study contributes to the field by highlighting the potential of integrating LLMs with traditional machine learning models to enhance predictive accuracy and personalize adult literacy education setting a foundation for future research in applying LLMs within ITSs.

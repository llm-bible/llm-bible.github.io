The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved the generation of fluent and convincing text raising concerns about their misuse on social media platforms. We present a methodology using Twitter datasets to examine the generative capabilities of four LLMs Llama 3 Mistral Qwen2 and GPT4o. We evaluate 7B and 8B parameter base45;instruction models of the three open45;source LLMs and validate the impact of further fine45;tuning and uncensored versions. Our findings show that uncensored models with additional in45;domain fine45;tuning dramatically reduce the effectiveness of automated detection methods. This study addresses a gap by exploring smaller open45;source models and the effects of uncensoring providing insights into how fine45;tuning and content moderation influence machine45;generated text detection.

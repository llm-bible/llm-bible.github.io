As the use of large language models (LLMs) increases within society as does the risk of their misuse. Appropriate safeguards must be in place to ensure LLM outputs uphold the ethical standards of society highlighting the positive role that artificial intelligence technologies can have. Recent events indicate ethical concerns around conventionally trained LLMs leading to overall unsafe user experiences. This motivates our research question how do we ensure LLM alignment In this work we introduce a test suite of unique prompts to foster the development of aligned LLMs that are fair safe and robust. We show that prompting LLMs at every step of the development pipeline including data curation pre45;training and fine45;tuning will result in an overall more responsible model. Our test suite evaluates outputs from four state45;of45;the45;art language models GPT45;3.5 GPT45;4 OPT and LLaMA45;2. The assessment presented in this paper highlights a gap between societal alignment and the capabilities of current LLMs. Additionally implementing a test suite such as ours lowers the environmental overhead of making models safe and fair.

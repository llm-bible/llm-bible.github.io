In recent years, the rise of AI-assisted code-generation tools has
significantly transformed software development. While code generators have
mainly been used to support conventional software development, their use will
be extended to powerful and secure AI systems. Systems capable of generating
code, such as ChatGPT, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, and AlphaCode, take
advantage of advances in machine learning (ML) and natural language processing
(NLP) enabled by large language models (LLMs). However, it must be borne in
mind that these models work probabilistically, which means that although they
can generate complex code from natural language input, there is no guarantee
for the functionality and security of the generated code.
  However, to fully exploit the considerable potential of this technology, the
security, reliability, functionality, and quality of the generated code must be
guaranteed. This paper examines the implementation of these goals to date and
explores strategies to optimize them. In addition, we explore how these systems
can be optimized to create safe, high-performance, and executable artificial
intelligence (AI) models, and consider how to improve their accessibility to
make AI development more inclusive and equitable.

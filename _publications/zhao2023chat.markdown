Programming robot behavior in a complex world faces challenges on multiple levels from dextrous low-level skills to high-level planning and reasoning. Recent pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning ability in few-shot robotic planning. However it remains challenging to ground LLMs in multimodal sensory input and continuous action output while enabling a robot to interact with its environment and acquire novel information as its policies unfold. We develop a robot interaction scenario with a partially observable state which necessitates a robot to decide on a range of epistemic actions in order to sample sensory information among multiple modalities before being able to execute the task correctly. Matcha (Multimodal environment chatting) agent an interactive perception framework is therefore proposed with an LLM as its backbone whose ability is exploited to instruct epistemic actions and to reason over the resulting multimodal sensations (vision sound haptics proprioception) as well as to plan an entire task execution based on the interactively acquired information. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can provide high-level planning and reasoning skills and control interactive robot behavior in a multimodal environment while multimodal modules with the context of the environmental state help ground the LLMs and extend their processing ability.

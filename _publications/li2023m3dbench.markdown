Recently 3D understanding has become popular to facilitate autonomous agents to perform further decisionmaking. However existing 3D datasets and methods are often limited to specific tasks. On the other hand recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) have demonstrated exceptional general language and imagery tasking performance. Therefore it is interesting to unlock MLMs potential to be 3D generalist for wider tasks. However current MLMs research has been less focused on 3D tasks due to a lack of large-scale 3D instruction-following datasets. In this work we introduce a comprehensive 3D instructionfollowing dataset called M3DBench which possesses the following characteristics 1) It supports general multimodal instructions interleaved with text images 3D objects and other visual prompts. 2) It unifies diverse 3D tasks at both region and scene levels covering a variety of fundamental abilities in real-world 3D environments. 3) It is a large-scale 3D instruction-following dataset with over 320k instruction-response pairs. Furthermore we establish a new benchmark for assessing the performance of large models in understanding multi-modal 3D prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and baseline supporting general 3D-centric tasks which can inspire future research.

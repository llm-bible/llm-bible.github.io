Recent advances in LLMs, particularly in language reasoning and tool integration, have rapidly sparked the *Language Agents* for real-world development. Among these, travel planning represents a prominent domain, combining complex multi-objective planning challenges with practical deployment demands. However, existing benchmarks often oversimplify real-world requirements by focusing on synthetic queries and limited constraints. We address the gap of evaluating language agents in multi-day, multi-POI travel planning scenarios with diverse and open human needs. Specifically, we introduce *ChinaTravel*, the first open-ended benchmark grounded in authentic Chinese travel requirements collected from 1,154 human participants. We design a compositionally generalizable domain-specific language (DSL) for scalable evaluation, covering feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and preference comparison. Empirical studies reveal the potential of neuro-symbolic agents in travel planning, achieving a 37.0% constraint satisfaction rate on human queries, a 10\times improvement over purely neural models. These findings highlight ChinaTravel as a pivotal milestone for advancing language agents in complex, real-world planning scenarios.

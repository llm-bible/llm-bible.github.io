Large Language Models (LLMs) are likely to play a key role in Intent-Based
Networking (IBN) as they show remarkable performance in interpreting human
language as well as code generation, enabling the translation of high-level
intents expressed by humans into low-level network configurations. In this
paper, we leverage closed-source language models (i.e., Google Gemini 1.5 pro,
ChatGPT-4) and open-source models (i.e., LLama, Mistral) to investigate their
capacity to generate E2E network configurations for radio access networks
(RANs) and core networks in 5G/6G mobile networks. We introduce a novel
performance metrics, known as FEACI, to quantitatively assess the format (F),
explainability (E), accuracy (A), cost (C), and inference time (I) of the
generated answer; existing general metrics are unable to capture these
features. The results of our study demonstrate that open-source models can
achieve comparable or even superior translation performance compared with the
closed-source models requiring costly hardware setup and not accessible to all
users.

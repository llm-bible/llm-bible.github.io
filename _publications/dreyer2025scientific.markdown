Large language models (LLMs) can answer questions and reason about complex
tasks, also from the scientific domain. We assess several multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) on ScienceQA and find that Gemini models show the highest accuracy with
little context, and the highest textual similarity to human explanations with
richer context. Adapter-tuning of smaller MLLMs did not lead to any reliable
performance. Training from Gemini outputs consistently underperformed training
from the original data.

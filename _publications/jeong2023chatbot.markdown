Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in mimicking fictional characters or real humans in conversational settings. However the realism and consistency of these responses can be further enhanced by providing richer information of the agent being mimicked. In this paper we propose a novel approach to generate more realistic and consistent responses from LLMs leveraging five senses attributes emotional states relationship with the interlocutor and memories. By incorporating these factors we aim to increase the LLMs capacity for generating natural and realistic reactions in conversational exchanges. Through our research we expect to contribute to the development of LLMs that demonstrate improved capabilities in mimicking fictional characters. We release a new benchmark dataset and all our codes prompts and sample results on our Github https://github.com/srafsasm/InfoRichBot"

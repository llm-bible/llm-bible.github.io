The rapid development in large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing and understanding (NLP/NLU), offering
significant benefits across various domains. However, when applied to
scientific research, these powerful models exhibit critical failure modes
related to scientific integrity and trustworthiness. Existing general-purpose
LLM guardrails are insufficient to address these unique challenges in the
scientific domain. We provide comprehensive guidelines for deploying LLM
guardrails in the scientific domain. We identify specific challenges --
including time sensitivity, knowledge contextualization, conflict resolution,
and intellectual property concerns -- and propose a guideline framework for the
guardrails that can align with scientific needs. These guardrail dimensions
include trustworthiness, ethics & bias, safety, and legal aspects. We also
outline in detail the implementation strategies that employ white-box,
black-box, and gray-box methodologies that can be enforced within scientific
contexts.

The formidable capacity for zero45; or few45;shot decision45;making in language agents encourages us to pose a compelling question Can language agents be alternatives to PPO agents in traditional sequential decision45;making tasks To investigate this we first take environments collected in OpenAI Gym as our testbeds and ground them to textual environments that construct the TextGym simulator. This allows for straightforward and efficient comparisons between PPO agents and language agents given the widespread adoption of OpenAI Gym. To ensure a fair and effective benchmarking we introduce 5 levels of scenario for accurate domain45;knowledge controlling and a unified RL45;inspired framework for language agents. Additionally we propose an innovative explore45;exploit45;guided language (EXE) agent to solve tasks within TextGym. Through numerical experiments and ablation studies we extract valuable insights into the decision45;making capabilities of language agents and make a preliminary evaluation of their potential to be alternatives to PPO in classical sequential decision45;making problems. This paper sheds light on the performance of language agents and paves the way for future research in this exciting domain. Our code is publicly available at~url123;https://github.com/mail&#45;ecnu/Text&#45;Gym&#45;Agents&#125;.

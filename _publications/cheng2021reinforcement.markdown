Controlling the generative model to adapt a new domain with limited samples is a difficult challenge and it is receiving increasing attention. Recently methods based on meta-learning have shown promising results for few-shot domain adaptation. However meta-learning-based methods usually suffer from the problem of overfitting which results in a lack of diversity in the generated texts. To avoid this problem in this study a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) is proposed. In this framework to increase the sample utilization of RL and decrease its sample requirement maximum likelihood estimation learning is incorporated into the RL process. When there are only a few in-domain samples available experimental results on five target domains in two few-shot configurations show that this framework performs better than baselines.

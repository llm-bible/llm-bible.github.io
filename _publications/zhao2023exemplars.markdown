Recently large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in natural language processing. The most representative ability of LLMs is in45;context learning (ICL) which enables LLMs to learn patterns from in45;context exemplars without training. The performance of ICL greatly depends on the exemplars used. However how to choose exemplars remains unclear due to the lack of understanding of how in45;context learning works. In this paper we present a novel perspective on ICL by conceptualizing it as contextual retrieval from a model of associative memory. We establish a theoretical framework of ICL based on Hopfield Networks. Based on our framework we look into how in45;context exemplars influence the performance of ICL and propose more efficient active exemplar selection. Our study sheds new light on the mechanism of ICL by connecting it to memory retrieval with potential implications for advancing the understanding of LLMs.

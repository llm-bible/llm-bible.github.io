Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
various tasks, with their performance heavily dependent on the quality of input
prompts. While prompt engineering has proven effective, it typically relies on
manual adjustments, making it time-consuming and potentially suboptimal. This
paper introduces GAAPO (Genetic Algorithm Applied to Prompt Optimization), a
novel hybrid optimization framework that leverages genetic algorithm principles
to evolve prompts through successive generations. Unlike traditional genetic
approaches that rely solely on mutation and crossover operations, GAAPO
integrates multiple specialized prompt generation strategies within its
evolutionary framework. Through extensive experimentation on diverse datasets
including ETHOS, MMLU-Pro, and GPQA, our analysis reveals several important
point for the future development of automatic prompt optimization methods:
importance of the tradeoff between the population size and the number of
generations, effect of selection methods on stability results, capacity of
different LLMs and especially reasoning models to be able to automatically
generate prompts from similar queries... Furthermore, we provide insights into
the relative effectiveness of different prompt generation strategies and their
evolution across optimization phases. These findings contribute to both the
theoretical understanding of prompt optimization and practical applications in
improving LLM performance.

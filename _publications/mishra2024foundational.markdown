Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global
challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature
comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in
knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials
research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective
deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving
domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models
for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models
on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data.
Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in
materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining
general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant
demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation,
predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table.
Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2,
we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific
performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured
information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal
structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs.
Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain
adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials
research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important
considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training
methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the
development of specialized scientific AI systems.

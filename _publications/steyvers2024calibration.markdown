For large language models (LLMs) to be trusted by humans they need to be well-calibrated in the sense that they can accurately assess and communicate how likely it is that their predictions are correct. Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLMs responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions we systematically examine human users ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas (1) assessing users perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the models confidence and its accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLMs internal confidence we observe a significant shift in user perception aligning it more closely with the models actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.

There is a growing need for Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively use tools and external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to plan and complete tasks. As such there is tremendous interest in methods that can acquire sufficient quantities of train and test data that involve calls to tools / APIs. Two lines of research have emerged as the predominant strategies for addressing this challenge. The first has focused on synthetic data generation techniques while the second has involved curating task45;adjacent datasets which can be transformed into API / Tool45;based tasks. In this paper we focus on the task of identifying curating and transforming existing datasets and in turn introduce API45;BLEND a large corpora for training and systematic testing of tool45;augmented LLMs. The datasets mimic real45;world scenarios involving API45;tasks such as API / tool detection slot filling and sequencing of the detected APIs. We demonstrate the utility of the API45;BLEND dataset for both training and benchmarking purposes.

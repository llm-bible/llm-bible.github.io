The ability to reason with multiple hierarchical structures is an attractive and desirable property of sequential inductive biases for natural language processing. Do the state45;of45;the45;art Transformers and LSTM architectures implicitly encode for these biases To answer this we propose ORCHARD a diagnostic dataset for systematically evaluating hierarchical reasoning in state45;of45;the45;art neural sequence models. While there have been prior evaluation frameworks such as ListOps or Logical Inference our work presents a novel and more natural setting where our models learn to reason with multiple explicit hierarchical structures instead of only one i.e. requiring the ability to do both long45;term sequence memorizing relational reasoning while reasoning with hierarchical structure. Consequently backed by a set of rigorous experiments we show that (1) Transformer and LSTM models surprisingly fail in systematic generalization and (2) with increased references between hierarchies Transformer performs no better than random.

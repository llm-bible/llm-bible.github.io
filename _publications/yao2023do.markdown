This study examines the effect of prompt engineering on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical note generation. We introduce an Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) framework to refine initial prompts and compare the outputs of medical experts non45;medical experts and APO45;enhanced GPT3.5 and GPT4. Results highlight GPT4 APOs superior performance in standardizing prompt quality across clinical note sections. A human45;in45;the45;loop approach shows that experts maintain content quality post45;APO with a preference for their own modifications suggesting the value of expert customization. We recommend a two45;phase optimization process leveraging APO45;GPT4 for consistency and expert input for personalization.

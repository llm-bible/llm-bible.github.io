This paper focuses on automatically generating the text of an ad and the goal is that the generated text can capture user interest for achieving higher click45;through rate (CTR). We propose CREATER a CTR45;driven advertising text generation approach to generate ad texts based on high45;quality user reviews. To incorporate CTR objective our model learns from online A/B test data with contrastive learning which encourages the model to generate ad texts that obtain higher CTR. To alleviate the low45;resource issue we design a customized self45;supervised objective reducing the gap between pre45;training and fine45;tuning. Experiments on industrial datasets show that CREATER significantly outperforms current approaches. It has been deployed online in a leading advertising platform and brings uplift on core online metrics.

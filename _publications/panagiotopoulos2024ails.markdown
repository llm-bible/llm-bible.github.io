In this paper we outline our submission for the SemEval45;2024 Task 9 competition BRAINTEASER A Novel Task Defying Common Sense. We engage in both sub45;tasks Sub45;task A45;Sentence Puzzle and Sub45;task B45;Word Puzzle. We evaluate a plethora of pre45;trained transformer45;based language models of different sizes through fine45;tuning. Subsequently we undertake an analysis of their scores and responses to aid future researchers in understanding and utilizing these models effectively. Our top45;performing approaches secured competitive positions on the competition leaderboard across both sub45;tasks. In the evaluation phase our best submission attained an average accuracy score of 81.737; in the Sentence Puzzle and 85.437; in the Word Puzzle significantly outperforming the best neural baseline (ChatGPT) by more than 2037; and 3037; respectively.

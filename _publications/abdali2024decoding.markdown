Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) by demonstrating an impressive ability to generate human-like text. However their widespread usage introduces challenges that necessitate thoughtful examination ethical scrutiny and responsible practices. In this study we delve into these challenges explore existing strategies for mitigating them with a particular emphasis on identifying AI-generated text as the ultimate solution. Additionally we assess the feasibility of detection from a theoretical perspective and propose novel research directions to address the current limitations in this domain.

As the breadth and depth of language model applications continue to expand rapidly it is increasingly important to build efficient frameworks for measuring and mitigating the learned or inherited social biases of these models. In this paper we present our work on evaluating instruction fine45;tuned language models ability to identify bias through zero45;shot prompting including Chain45;of45;Thought (CoT) prompts. Across LLaMA and its two instruction fine45;tuned versions Alpaca 7B performs best on the bias identification task with an accuracy of 56.737;. We also demonstrate that scaling up LLM size and data diversity could lead to further performance gain. This is a work45;in45;progress presenting the first component of our bias mitigation framework. We will keep updating this work as we get more results.

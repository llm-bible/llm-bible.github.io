The recently released ChatGPT model demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in zero-shot question-answering. In this work we probe ChatGPT for its conversational understanding and introduce a conversational framework (protocol) that can be adopted in future studies. The Pokemon universe serves as an ideal testing ground for auditing ChatGPTs reasoning capabilities due to its closed world assumption. After bringing ChatGPTs background knowledge (on the Pokemon universe) to light we test its reasoning process when using these concepts in battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability to acquire new knowledge and include it in its reasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to assess ChatGPTs ability to generalize combine features and to acquire and reason over newly introduced knowledge from human feedback. We find that ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe which can reason upon in battle scenarios to a great extent even when new information is introduced. The model performs better with collaborative feedback and if there is an initial phase of information retrieval but also hallucinates occasionally and is susceptible to adversarial attacks.

We introduce TacoBot, a user-centered task-oriented digital assistant
designed to guide users through complex real-world tasks with multiple steps.
Covering a wide range of cooking and how-to tasks, we aim to deliver a
collaborative and engaging dialogue experience. Equipped with language
understanding, dialogue management, and response generation components
supported by a robust search engine, TacoBot ensures efficient task assistance.
To enhance the dialogue experience, we explore a series of data augmentation
strategies using LLMs to train advanced neural models continuously. TacoBot
builds upon our successful participation in the inaugural Alexa Prize TaskBot
Challenge, where our team secured third place among ten competing teams. We
offer TacoBot as an open-source framework that serves as a practical example
for deploying task-oriented dialogue systems.

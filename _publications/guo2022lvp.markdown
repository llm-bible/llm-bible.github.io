Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) focuses on enhancing text-only translation with visual features which has attracted considerable attention from both natural language processing and computer vision communities. Recent advances still struggle to train a separate model for each language pair which is costly and unaffordable when the number of languages increases in the real world. In other words the multilingual multimodal machine translation (Multilingual MMT) task has not been investigated which aims to handle the aforementioned issues by providing a shared semantic space for multiple languages. Besides the image modality has no language boundaries which is superior to bridging the semantic gap between languages. To this end we first propose the Multilingual MMT task by establishing two new Multilingual MMT benchmark datasets covering seven languages. Then an effective baseline LVP-M3 using visual prompts is proposed to support translations between different languages which includes three stages (token encoding language-aware visual prompt generation and language translation). Extensive experimental results on our constructed benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LVP-M3 method for Multilingual MMT.

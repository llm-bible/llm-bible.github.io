Large Language Model (LLM) applications, including LLM app stores and
autonomous agents, are shaping the future of AI ecosystems. However, platform
silos, fragmented hardware integration, and the absence of standardized
interfaces limit scalability, interoperability, and resource efficiency. While
LLM app stores democratize AI, their closed ecosystems restrict modular AI
reuse and cross-platform portability. Meanwhile, agent-based frameworks offer
flexibility but often lack seamless integration across diverse environments.
This paper envisions the future of LLM applications and proposes a three-layer
decoupled architecture grounded in software engineering principles such as
layered system design, service-oriented architectures, and hardware-software
co-design. This architecture separates application logic, communication
protocols, and hardware execution, enhancing modularity, efficiency, and
cross-platform compatibility. Beyond architecture, we highlight key security
and privacy challenges for safe, scalable AI deployment and outline research
directions in software and security engineering. This vision aims to foster
open, secure, and interoperable LLM ecosystems, guiding future advancements in
AI applications.

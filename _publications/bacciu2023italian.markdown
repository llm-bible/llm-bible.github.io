This paper presents Fauno, the first and largest open-source Italian
conversational Large Language Model (LLM). Our goal with Fauno is to
democratize the study of LLMs in Italian, demonstrating that obtaining a
fine-tuned conversational bot with a single GPU is possible. In addition, we
release a collection of datasets for conversational AI in Italian. The datasets
on which we fine-tuned Fauno include various topics such as general question
answering, computer science, and medical questions. We release our code and
datasets on \url\{https://github.com/RSTLess-research/Fauno-Italian-LLM\}

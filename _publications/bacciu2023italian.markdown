This paper presents Fauno the first and largest open45;source Italian conversational Large Language Model (LLM). Our goal with Fauno is to democratize the study of LLMs in Italian demonstrating that obtaining a fine45;tuned conversational bot with a single GPU is possible. In addition we release a collection of datasets for conversational AI in Italian. The datasets on which we fine45;tuned Fauno include various topics such as general question answering computer science and medical questions. We release our code and datasets on url123;https://github.com/RSTLess&#45;research/Fauno&#45;Italian&#45;LLM&#125;

Open domain question answering (OpenQA) tasks have been recently attracting
more and more attention from the natural language processing (NLP) community.
In this work, we present the first free-form multiple-choice OpenQA dataset for
solving medical problems, MedQA, collected from the professional medical board
exams. It covers three languages: English, simplified Chinese, and traditional
Chinese, and contains 12,723, 34,251, and 14,123 questions for the three
languages, respectively. We implement both rule-based and popular neural
methods by sequentially combining a document retriever and a machine
comprehension model. Through experiments, we find that even the current best
method can only achieve 36.7%, 42.0%, and 70.1% of test accuracy on the
English, traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese questions, respectively.
We expect MedQA to present great challenges to existing OpenQA systems and hope
that it can serve as a platform to promote much stronger OpenQA models from the
NLP community in the future.

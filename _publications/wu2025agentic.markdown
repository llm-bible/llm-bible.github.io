We introduce Agentic Reasoning, a framework that enhances large language
model (LLM) reasoning by integrating external tool-using agents. Unlike
conventional LLM-based reasoning approaches, which rely solely on internal
inference, Agentic Reasoning dynamically engages web search, code execution,
and structured reasoning-context memory to solve complex problems requiring
deep research and multi-step logical deduction. Our framework introduces the
Mind Map agent, which constructs a structured knowledge graph to track logical
relationships, improving deductive reasoning. Additionally, the integration of
web-search and coding agents enables real-time retrieval and computational
analysis, enhancing reasoning accuracy and decision-making. Evaluations on
PhD-level scientific reasoning (GPQA) and domain-specific deep research tasks
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing models,
including leading retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and
closed-source LLMs. Moreover, our results indicate that agentic reasoning
improves expert-level knowledge synthesis, test-time scalability, and
structured problem-solving. The code is at:

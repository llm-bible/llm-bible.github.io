Chat-based prompts respond with verbose linear-sequential texts, making it
difficult to explore and refine ambiguous intents, back up and reinterpret, or
shift directions in creative AI-assisted design work. AI-Instruments instead
embody "prompts" as interface objects via three key principles: (1) Reification
of user-intent as reusable direct-manipulation instruments; (2) Reflection of
multiple interpretations of ambiguous user-intents (Reflection-in-intent) as
well as the range of AI-model responses (Reflection-in-response) to inform
design "moves" towards a desired result; and (3) Grounding to instantiate an
instrument from an example, result, or extrapolation directly from another
instrument. Further, AI-Instruments leverage LLM's to suggest, vary, and refine
new instruments, enabling a system that goes beyond hard-coded functionality by
generating its own instrumental controls from content. We demonstrate four
technology probes, applied to image generation, and qualitative insights from
twelve participants, showing how AI-Instruments address challenges of intent
formulation, steering via direct manipulation, and non-linear iterative
workflows to reflect and resolve ambiguous intents.

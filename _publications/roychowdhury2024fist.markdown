'Financial report generation using general purpose large language models pose two major challenges, including the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are incapable of curing the writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two-stage fine-tuning process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt-completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. Our proposed fine-tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 50&#37;. Additionally, the two-stage fine tuned models have lower perplexity, improved ROUGE, TER and BLEU scores, higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy.'

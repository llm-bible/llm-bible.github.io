Financial report generation using general purpose large language models pose two major challenges including the lack of compound sentences and hallucinations. Advanced prompt engineering and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) techniques are incapable of curing the writing style discrepancies. In this work we propose a novel two45;stage fine45;tuning process wherein public domain financial reports are processed into prompt45;completions and augmented using simple LLM prompts to then enable sectional financial report generation using minimal instructions and tabular data inputs. Our proposed fine45;tuning framework results doubles the number of correct questions answers and reduces hallucinations by over 5037;. Additionally the two45;stage fine tuned models have lower perplexity improved ROUGE TER and BLEU scores higher creativity and knowledge density with lower uncertainty and cross entropy.

The widespread adoption of generative AI has generated diverse opinions, with
individuals expressing both support and criticism of its applications. This
study investigates the emotional dynamics surrounding generative AI by
analyzing human tweets referencing terms such as ChatGPT, OpenAI, Copilot, and
LLMs. To further understand the emotional intelligence of ChatGPT, we examine
its responses to selected tweets, highlighting differences in sentiment between
human comments and LLM-generated responses. We introduce EmoXpt, a sentiment
analysis framework designed to assess both human perspectives on generative AI
and the sentiment embedded in ChatGPT's responses. Unlike prior studies that
focus exclusively on human sentiment, EmoXpt uniquely evaluates the emotional
expression of ChatGPT. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-generated
responses are notably more efficient, cohesive, and consistently positive than
human responses.

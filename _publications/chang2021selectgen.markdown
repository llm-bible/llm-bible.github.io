We propose a shared task on training instance selection for few45;shot neural text generation. Large45;scale pretrained language models have led to dramatic improvements in few45;shot text generation. Nonetheless almost all previous work simply applies random sampling to select the few45;shot training instances. Little to no attention has been paid to the selection strategies and how they would affect model performance. The study of the selection strategy can help us to (1) make the most use of our annotation budget in downstream tasks and (2) better benchmark few45;shot text generative models. We welcome submissions that present their selection strategies and the effects on the generation quality.

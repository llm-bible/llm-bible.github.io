Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful support tools across various natural language tasks and a range of application domains. Recent studies focus on exploring their capabilities for data annotation. This paper provides a comparative overview of twelve studies investigating the potential of LLMs in labelling data. While the models demonstrate promising cost and time45;saving benefits there exist considerable limitations such as representativeness bias sensitivity to prompt variations and English language preference. Leveraging insights from these studies our empirical analysis further examines the alignment between human and GPT45;generated opinion distributions across four subjective datasets. In contrast to the studies examining representation our methodology directly obtains the opinion distribution from GPT. Our analysis thereby supports the minority of studies that are considering diverse perspectives when evaluating data annotation tasks and highlights the need for further research in this direction.

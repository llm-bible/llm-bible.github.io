With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, large language models
(LLMs) have made remarkable advancements in natural language processing. These
models are trained on vast datasets to exhibit powerful language understanding
and generation capabilities across various applications, including machine
translation, chatbots, and agents. However, LLMs have revealed a variety of
privacy and security issues throughout their life cycle, drawing significant
academic and industrial attention. Moreover, the risks faced by LLMs differ
significantly from those encountered by traditional language models. Given that
current surveys lack a clear taxonomy of unique threat models across diverse
scenarios, we emphasize the unique privacy and security threats associated with
five specific scenarios: pre-training, fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented
generation systems, deployment, and LLM-based agents. Addressing the
characteristics of each risk, this survey outlines potential threats and
countermeasures. Research on attack and defense situations can offer feasible
research directions, enabling more areas to benefit from LLMs.

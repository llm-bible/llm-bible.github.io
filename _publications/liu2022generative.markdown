Building user simulators (USs) for reinforcement learning (RL) of task45;oriented dialog systems (DSs) has gained more and more attention which however still faces several fundamental challenges. First it is unclear whether we can leverage pretrained language models to design for example GPT45;2 based USs to catch up and interact with the recently advanced GPT45;2 based DSs. Second an important ingredient in a US is that the user goal can be effectively incorporated and tracked; but how to flexibly integrate goal state tracking and develop an end45;to45;end trainable US for multi45;domains has remained to be a challenge. In this work we propose a generative user simulator (GUS) with GPT45;2 based architecture and goal state tracking towards addressing the above two challenges. Extensive experiments are conducted on MultiWOZ2.1. Different DSs are trained via RL with GUS the classic agenda45;based user simulator (ABUS) and other ablation simulators respectively and are compared for cross45;model evaluation corpus45;based evaluation and human evaluation. The GUS achieves superior results in all three evaluation tasks.

Text45;to45;video is a rapidly growing research area that aims to generate a semantic identical and temporal coherence sequence of frames that accurately align with the input text prompt. This study focuses on zero45;shot text45;to45;video generation considering the data45; and cost45;efficient. To generate a semantic45;coherent video exhibiting a rich portrayal of temporal semantics such as the whole process of flower blooming rather than a set of moving images we propose a novel Free45;Bloom pipeline that harnesses large language models (LLMs) as the director to generate a semantic45;coherence prompt sequence while pre45;trained latent diffusion models (LDMs) as the animator to generate the high fidelity frames. Furthermore to ensure temporal and identical coherence while maintaining semantic coherence we propose a series of annotative modifications to adapting LDMs in the reverse process including joint noise sampling step45;aware attention shift and dual45;path interpolation. Without any video data and training requirements Free45;Bloom generates vivid and high45;quality videos awe45;inspiring in generating complex scenes with semantic meaningful frame sequences. In addition Free45;Bloom is naturally compatible with LDMs45;based extensions.

This paper describes our submission to the MEDIQA45;Chat 2023 shared task for automatic clinical note generation from doctor45;patient conversations. We report results for two approaches the first fine45;tunes a pre45;trained language model (PLM) on the shared task data and the second uses few45;shot in45;context learning (ICL) with a large language model (LLM). Both achieve high performance as measured by automatic metrics (e.g. ROUGE BERTScore) and ranked second and first respectively of all submissions to the shared task. Expert human scrutiny indicates that notes generated via the ICL45;based approach with GPT45;4 are preferred about as often as human45;written notes making it a promising path toward automated note generation from doctor45;patient conversations.

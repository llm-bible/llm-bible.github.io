Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to generate more reliable and accurate responses by augmenting large language models (LLMs) with the external vast and dynamic knowledge. Most previous work focuses on using RAG for single45;round question answering while how to adapt RAG to the complex conversational setting wherein the question is interdependent on the preceding context is not well studied. In this paper we propose a conversation45;level RAG approach which incorporates fine45;grained retrieval augmentation and self45;check for conversational question answering (CQA). In particular our approach consists of three components namely conversational question refiner fine45;grained retriever and self45;check based response generator which work collaboratively for question understanding and relevant information acquisition in conversational settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate the great advantages of our approach over the state45;of45;the45;art baselines. Moreover we also release a Chinese CQA dataset with new features including reformulated question extracted keyword retrieved paragraphs and their helpfulness which facilitates further researches in RAG enhanced CQA.

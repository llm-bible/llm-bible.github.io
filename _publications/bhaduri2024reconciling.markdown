Qualitative data collection and analysis approaches, such as those employing
interviews and focus groups, provide rich insights into customer attitudes,
sentiment, and behavior. However, manually analyzing qualitative data requires
extensive time and effort to identify relevant topics and thematic insights.
This study proposes a novel approach to address this challenge by leveraging
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) based Large Language Models (LLMs) for
analyzing interview transcripts. The novelty of this work lies in strategizing
the research inquiry as one that is augmented by an LLM that serves as a novice
research assistant. This research explores the mental model of LLMs to serve as
novice qualitative research assistants for researchers in the talent management
space. A RAG-based LLM approach is extended to enable topic modeling of
semi-structured interview data, showcasing the versatility of these models
beyond their traditional use in information retrieval and search. Our findings
demonstrate that the LLM-augmented RAG approach can successfully extract topics
of interest, with significant coverage compared to manually generated topics
from the same dataset. This establishes the viability of employing LLMs as
novice qualitative research assistants. Additionally, the study recommends that
researchers leveraging such models lean heavily on quality criteria used in
traditional qualitative research to ensure rigor and trustworthiness of their
approach. Finally, the paper presents key recommendations for industry
practitioners seeking to reconcile the use of LLMs with established qualitative
research paradigms, providing a roadmap for the effective integration of these
powerful, albeit novice, AI tools in the analysis of qualitative datasets

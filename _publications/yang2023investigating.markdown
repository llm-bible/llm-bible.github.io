This work evaluated several cutting-edge large-scale foundation models based on self-supervision or weak supervision including SeamlessM4T SeamlessM4T v2 and Whisper-large-v3 on three code-switched corpora. We found that self-supervised models can achieve performances close to the supervised model indicating the effectiveness of multilingual self-supervised pre-training. We also observed that these models still have room for improvement as they kept making similar mistakes and had unsatisfactory performances on modeling intra-sentential code-switching. In addition the validity of several variants of Whisper was explored and we concluded that they remained effective in a code-switching scenario and similar techniques for self-supervised models are worth studying to boost the performance of code-switched tasks.

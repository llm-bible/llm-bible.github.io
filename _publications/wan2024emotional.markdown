Designing emotionally intelligent conversational systems to provide comfort
and advice to people experiencing distress is a compelling area of research.
Recently, with advancements in large language models (LLMs), end-to-end
dialogue agents without explicit strategy prediction steps have become
prevalent. However, implicit strategy planning lacks transparency, and recent
studies show that LLMs' inherent preference bias towards certain
socio-emotional strategies hinders the delivery of high-quality emotional
support. To address this challenge, we propose decoupling strategy prediction
from language generation, and introduce a novel dialogue strategy prediction
framework, EmoDynamiX, which models the discourse dynamics between user
fine-grained emotions and system strategies using a heterogeneous graph for
better performance and transparency. Experimental results on two ESC datasets
show EmoDynamiX outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with a
significant margin (better proficiency and lower preference bias). Our approach
also exhibits better transparency by allowing backtracing of decision making.

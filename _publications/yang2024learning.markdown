Large language models (LLMs) are known to struggle with complicated reasoning
tasks such as math word problems (MWPs). In this paper, we present how analogy
from similarly structured questions can improve LLMs' problem-solving
capabilities for MWPs. Specifically, we rely on the retrieval of problems with
similar computational graphs to the given question to serve as exemplars in the
prompt, providing the correct reasoning path for the generation model to refer
to. Empirical results across six math word problem datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method, which achieves a significant improvement
of up to 6.7 percent on average in absolute value, compared to baseline
methods. These results highlight our method's potential in addressing the
reasoning challenges in current LLMs.

Our paper presents team MasonTigers submission to the SemEval45;2024 Task 9 45; which provides a dataset of puzzles for testing natural language understanding. We employ large language models (LLMs) to solve this task through several prompting techniques. Zero45;shot and few45;shot prompting generate reasonably good results when tested with proprietary LLMs compared to the open45;source models. We obtain further improved results with chain45;of45;thought prompting an iterative prompting method that breaks down the reasoning process step45;by45;step. We obtain our best results by utilizing an ensemble of chain45;of45;thought prompts placing 2nd in the word puzzle subtask and 13th in the sentence puzzle subtask. The strong performance of prompted LLMs demonstrates their capability for complex reasoning when provided with a decomposition of the thought process. Our work sheds light on how step45;wise explanatory prompts can unlock more of the knowledge encoded in the parameters of large models.

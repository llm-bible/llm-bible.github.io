Large language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to variations in prompt
formulation, which can significantly impact their ability to generate accurate
responses. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Prompt Sensitivity
Prediction, and a dataset PromptSET designed to investigate the effects of
slight prompt variations on LLM performance. Using TriviaQA and HotpotQA
datasets as the foundation of our work, we generate prompt variations and
evaluate their effectiveness across multiple LLMs. We benchmark the prompt
sensitivity prediction task employing state-of-the-art methods from related
tasks, including LLM-based self-evaluation, text classification, and query
performance prediction techniques. Our findings reveal that existing methods
struggle to effectively address prompt sensitivity prediction, underscoring the
need to understand how information needs should be phrased for accurate LLM
responses.

Llama-Breeze2 (hereinafter referred to as Breeze2) is a suite of advanced
multi-modal language models, available in 3B and 8B parameter configurations,
specifically designed to enhance Traditional Chinese language representation.
Building upon the Llama 3.2 model family, we continue the pre-training of
Breeze2 on an extensive corpus to enhance the linguistic and cultural heritage
of Traditional Chinese. In addition to language modeling capabilities, we
significantly augment the models with function calling and vision understanding
capabilities. At the time of this publication, as far as we are aware, absent
reasoning-inducing prompts, Breeze2 are the strongest performing models in
Traditional Chinese function calling and image understanding in its size class.
The effectiveness of Breeze2 is benchmarked across various tasks, including
Taiwan general knowledge, instruction-following, long context, function
calling, and vision understanding. We are publicly releasing all Breeze2 models
under the Llama 3.2 Community License. We also showcase the capabilities of the
model running on mobile platform with a mobile application which we also open
source.

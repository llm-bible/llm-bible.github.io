Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in enabling
language agents to tackle simple tasks. However, applying them for complex,
multi-step, long-horizon tasks remains a challenge. Recent work have found
success by separating high-level planning from low-level execution, which
enables the model to effectively balance high-level planning objectives and
low-level execution details. However, generating accurate plans remains
difficult since LLMs are not inherently trained for this task. To address this,
we propose Plan-and-Act, a novel framework that incorporates explicit planning
into LLM-based agents and introduces a scalable method to enhance plan
generation through a novel synthetic data generation method. Plan-and-Act
consists of a Planner model which generates structured, high-level plans to
achieve user goals, and an Executor model that translates these plans into
environment-specific actions. To train the Planner effectively, we introduce a
synthetic data generation method that annotates ground-truth trajectories with
feasible plans, augmented with diverse and extensive examples to enhance
generalization. We evaluate Plan-and-Act using web navigation as a
representative long-horizon planning environment, demonstrating a
state-of-the-art 57.58% success rate on the WebArena-Lite benchmark as well as
a text-only state-of-the-art 81.36% success rate on WebVoyager.

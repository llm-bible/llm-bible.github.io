In this paper we present language model system submitted to SemEval-2020 Task 4 competition Commonsense Validation and Explanation. We participate in two subtasks for subtask A validation and subtask B Explanation. We implemented with transfer learning using pretrained language models (BERT XLNet RoBERTa and ALBERT) and fine-tune them on this task. Then we compared their characteristics in this task to help future researchers understand and use these models more properly. The ensembled model better solves this problem making the models accuracy reached 95.937; on subtask A which just worse than humans by only 337; accuracy.

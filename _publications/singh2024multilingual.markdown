As large language models (LLMs) see increasing adoption across the globe it is imperative for LLMs to be representative of the linguistic diversity of the world. India is a linguistically diverse country of 1.4 Billion people. To facilitate research on multilingual LLM evaluation we release IndicGenBench 45; the largest benchmark for evaluating LLMs on user45;facing generation tasks across a diverse set 29 of Indic languages covering 13 scripts and 4 language families. IndicGenBench is composed of diverse generation tasks like cross45;lingual summarization machine translation and cross45;lingual question answering. IndicGenBench extends existing benchmarks to many Indic languages through human curation providing multi45;way parallel evaluation data for many under45;represented Indic languages for the first time. We evaluate a wide range of proprietary and open45;source LLMs including GPT45;3.5 GPT45;4 PaLM45;2 mT5 Gemma BLOOM and LLaMA on IndicGenBench in a variety of settings. The largest PaLM45;2 models performs the best on most tasks however there is a significant performance gap in all languages compared to English showing that further research is needed for the development of more inclusive multilingual language models. IndicGenBench is released at www.github.com/google45;research45;datasets/indic45;gen45;bench

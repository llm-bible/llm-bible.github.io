Uncertainty estimation is a significant issue for current large language models (LLMs) that are generally poorly calibrated and over-confident especially with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Unlike humans whose decisions and confidences not only stem from intrinsic beliefs but can also be adjusted through daily observations existing calibration methods for LLMs focus on estimating or eliciting individual confidence without taking full advantage of the Collective Wisdom the interaction among multiple LLMs that can collectively improve both accuracy and calibration. In this work we propose Collaborative Calibration a post-hoc training-free calibration strategy that leverages the collaborative and expressive capabilities of multiple tool-augmented LLM agents in a simulated group deliberation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Collaborative Calibration on generative QA tasks across various domains showing its potential in harnessing the rationalization of collectively calibrated confidence assessments and improving the reliability of model predictions.

Constituency parsing is a fundamental yet unsolved natural language processing task. In this paper we explore the potential of recent large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable performance across various domains and tasks to tackle this task. We employ three linearization strategies to transform output trees into symbol sequences such that LLMs can solve constituency parsing by generating linearized trees. We conduct experiments using a diverse range of LLMs including ChatGPT GPT-4 OPT LLaMA and Alpaca comparing their performance against the state-of-the-art constituency parsers. Our experiments encompass zero-shot few-shot and full-training learning settings and we evaluate the models on one in-domain and five out-of-domain test datasets. Our findings reveal insights into LLMs performance generalization abilities and challenges in constituency parsing.

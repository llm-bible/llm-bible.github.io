Constituency parsing is a fundamental yet unsolved natural language processing task. In this paper we explore the potential of recent large language models (LLMs) that have exhibited remarkable performance across various domains and tasks to tackle this task. We employ three linearization strategies to transform output trees into symbol sequences such that LLMs can solve constituency parsing by generating linearized trees. We conduct experiments using a diverse range of LLMs including ChatGPT GPT45;4 OPT LLaMA and Alpaca comparing their performance against the state45;of45;the45;art constituency parsers. Our experiments encompass zero45;shot few45;shot and full45;training learning settings and we evaluate the models on one in45;domain and five out45;of45;domain test datasets. Our findings reveal insights into LLMs performance generalization abilities and challenges in constituency parsing.

What role can the otherwise successful Large Language Models (LLMs) play in the understanding of human cognition, and in particular in terms of informing language acquisition debates? To contribute to this question, we first argue that neither humans nor LLMs are general learners, in a variety of senses. We make a novel case for how in particular LLMs follow a dual-optimization process: they are optimized during their training (which is typically compared to language acquisition), and modern LLMs have also been selected, through a process akin to natural selection in a species. From this perspective, we argue that the performance of LLMs, whether similar or dissimilar to that of humans, does not weigh easily on important debates about the importance of human cognitive biases for language.

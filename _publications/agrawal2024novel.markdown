This paper introduces a novel paradigm for depression detection and treatment using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) Generative Pre45;trained Transformer 4 (GPT45;4) Llama 2 chat and Gemini. These LLMs are fine45;tuned with specialized prompts to diagnose explain and suggest therapeutic interventions for depression. A unique few45;shot prompting method enhances the models ability to analyze and explain depressive symptoms based on the DSM45;5 criteria. In the interaction phase the models engage in empathetic dialogue management drawing from resources like PsychDB and a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Guide fostering supportive interactions with individuals experiencing major depressive disorders. Additionally the research introduces the Illuminate Database enriched with various CBT modules aiding in personalized therapy recommendations. The study evaluates LLM performance using metrics such as F1 scores Precision Recall Cosine similarity and Recall45;Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) across different test sets demonstrating their effectiveness. This comprehensive approach blends cutting45;edge AI with established psychological methods offering new possibilities in mental health care and showcasing the potential of LLMs in revolutionizing depression diagnosis and treatment strategies.

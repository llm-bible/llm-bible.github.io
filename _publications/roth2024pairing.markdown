While LLMs in the RAG paradigm have shown remarkable performance on a variety of tasks they still under45;perform on unseen domains especially on complex tasks like procedural question answering. In this work we introduce a novel formalism and structure for manipulating text45;based procedures. Based on this formalism we further present a novel dataset called LCStep scraped from the LangChain Python docs. Moreover we extend the traditional RAG system to propose a novel system called analogy45;augmented generation (AAG) that draws inspiration from human analogical reasoning and ability to assimilate past experiences to solve unseen problems. The proposed method uses a frozen language model with a custom procedure memory store to adapt to specialized knowledge. We demonstrate that AAG outperforms few45;shot and RAG baselines on LCStep RecipeNLG and CHAMP datasets under a pairwise LLM45;based evaluation corroborated by human evaluation in the case of RecipeNLG.

Animal stereotypes are deeply embedded in human culture and language. They
often shape our perceptions and expectations of various species. Our study
investigates how animal stereotypes manifest in vision-language models during
the task of image generation. Through targeted prompts, we explore whether
DALL-E perpetuates stereotypical representations of animals, such as "owls as
wise," "foxes as unfaithful," etc. Our findings reveal significant stereotyped
instances where the model consistently generates images aligned with cultural
biases. The current work is the first of its kind to examine animal
stereotyping in vision-language models systematically and to highlight a
critical yet underexplored dimension of bias in AI-generated visual content.

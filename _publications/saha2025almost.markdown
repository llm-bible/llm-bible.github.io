The growing use of large language models (LLMs) for text generation has led
to widespread concerns about AI-generated content detection. However, an
overlooked challenge is AI-polished text, where human-written content undergoes
subtle refinements using AI tools. This raises a critical question: should
minimally polished text be classified as AI-generated? Such classification can
lead to false plagiarism accusations and misleading claims about AI prevalence
in online content. In this study, we systematically evaluate twelve
state-of-the-art AI-text detectors using our AI-Polished-Text Evaluation
(APT-Eval) dataset, which contains 14.7K samples refined at varying
AI-involvement levels. Our findings reveal that detectors frequently flag even
minimally polished text as AI-generated, struggle to differentiate between
degrees of AI involvement, and exhibit biases against older and smaller models.
These limitations highlight the urgent need for more nuanced detection
methodologies.

Since the release of ChatGPT and GPT-4, large language models (LLMs) and
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted widespread attention
for their exceptional capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and generation,
introducing transformative paradigms for integrating artificial intelligence
into medicine. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
development, principles, application scenarios, challenges, and future
directions of LLMs and MLLMs in medicine. Specifically, it begins by examining
the paradigm shift, tracing the transition from traditional models to LLMs and
MLLMs, and highlighting the unique advantages of these LLMs and MLLMs in
medical applications. Next, the survey reviews existing medical LLMs and MLLMs,
providing detailed guidance on their construction and evaluation in a clear and
systematic manner. Subsequently, to underscore the substantial value of LLMs
and MLLMs in healthcare, the survey explores five promising applications in the
field. Finally, the survey addresses the challenges confronting medical LLMs
and MLLMs and proposes practical strategies and future directions for their
integration into medicine. In summary, this survey offers a comprehensive
analysis of the technical methodologies and practical clinical applications of
medical LLMs and MLLMs, with the goal of bridging the gap between these
advanced technologies and clinical practice, thereby fostering the evolution of
the next generation of intelligent healthcare systems.

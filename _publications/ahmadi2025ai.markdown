Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) is an intervention that involves vividly
imagining personal future events and experiences in detail. It has shown
promise as an intervention to reduce delay discounting - the tendency to
devalue delayed rewards in favor of immediate gratification - and to promote
behavior change in a range of maladaptive health behaviors. We present
EFTeacher, an AI chatbot powered by the GPT-4-Turbo large language model,
designed to generate EFT cues for users with lifestyle-related conditions. To
evaluate the chatbot, we conducted a user study that included usability
assessments and user evaluations based on content characteristics
questionnaires, followed by semi-structured interviews. The study provides
qualitative insights into participants' experiences and interactions with the
chatbot and its usability. Our findings highlight the potential application of
AI chatbots based on Large Language Models (LLMs) in EFT interventions, and
offer design guidelines for future behavior-oriented applications.

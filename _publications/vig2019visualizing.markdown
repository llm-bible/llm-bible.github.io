We present an open45;source tool for visualizing multi45;head self45;attention in Transformer45;based language representation models. The tool extends earlier work by visualizing attention at three levels of granularity the attention45;head level the model level and the neuron level. We describe how each of these views can help to interpret the model and we demonstrate the tool on the BERT model and the OpenAI GPT45;2 model. We also present three use cases for analyzing GPT45;2 detecting model bias identifying recurring patterns and linking neurons to model behavior.

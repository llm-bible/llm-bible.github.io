Transformer based architectures have shown notable results on many down
streaming tasks including question answering. The availability of data, on the
other hand, impedes obtaining legitimate performance for low-resource
languages. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of pre-trained
multilingual models to improve the performance of question answering in
low-resource languages. We tested four combinations of language and task
adapters using multilingual transformer architectures on seven languages
similar to MLQA dataset. Additionally, we have also proposed zero-shot transfer
learning of low-resource question answering using language and task adapters.
We observed that stacking the language and the task adapters improves the
multilingual transformer models' performance significantly for low-resource
languages.

The article aims to analyze the performance of ChatGPT a large language model developed by OpenAI in the context of cardiology and vascular pathologies. The study evaluated the accuracy of ChatGPT in answering challenging multiple-choice questions (QCM) using a dataset of 190 questions from the Siamois-QCM platform. The goal was to assess ChatGPT potential as a valuable tool in medical education compared to two well-ranked students of medicine. The results showed that ChatGPT outperformed the students scoring 175 out of 190 correct answers with a percentage of 92.10 while the two students achieved scores of 163 and 159 with percentages of 85.78 and 82.63 respectively. These results showcase how ChatGPT has the potential to be highly effective in the fields of cardiology and vascular pathologies by providing accurate answers to relevant questions.

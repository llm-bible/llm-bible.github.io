Advanced large language models like ChatGPT have gained considerable attention recently including among students. However while the debate on ChatGPT in academia is making waves more understanding is needed among lecturers and teachers on how students use and perceive ChatGPT. To address this gap we analyzed the content on ChatGPT available on TikTok in February 2023. TikTok is a rapidly growing social media platform popular among individuals under 30. Specifically we analyzed the content of the 100 most popular videos in English tagged with chatgpt which collectively garnered over 250 million views. Most of the videos we studied promoted the use of ChatGPT for tasks like writing essays or code. In addition many videos discussed AI detectors with a focus on how other tools can help to transform ChatGPT output to fool these detectors. This also mirrors the discussion among educators on how to treat ChatGPT as lecturers and teachers in teaching and grading. What is however missing from the analyzed clips on TikTok are videos that discuss ChatGPT producing content that is nonsensical or unfaithful to the training data.

Recently, procedural content generation has exhibited considerable
advancements in the domain of 2D game level generation such as Super Mario
Bros. and Sokoban through large language models (LLMs). To further validate the
capabilities of LLMs, this paper explores how LLMs contribute to the generation
of 3D buildings in a sandbox game, Minecraft. We propose a Text to Building in
Minecraft (T2BM) model, which involves refining prompts, decoding interlayer
representation and repairing. Facade, indoor scene and functional blocks like
doors are supported in the generation. Experiments are conducted to evaluate
the completeness and satisfaction of buildings generated via LLMs. It shows
that LLMs hold significant potential for 3D building generation. Given
appropriate prompts, LLMs can generate correct buildings in Minecraft with
complete structures and incorporate specific building blocks such as windows
and beds, meeting the specified requirements of human users.

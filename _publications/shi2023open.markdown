Software development plays a crucial role in driving innovation and efficiency across modern societies. To meet the demands of this dynamic field there is a growing need for an effective software development assistant. However existing large language models represented by ChatGPT suffer from limited accessibility including training data and model weights. Although other large open-source models like LLaMA have shown promise they still struggle with understanding human intent. In this paper we present SoTaNa an open-source software development assistant. SoTaNa utilizes ChatGPT to generate high-quality instruction-based data for the domain of software engineering and employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to enhance the open-source foundation model LLaMA. We evaluate the effectiveness of (our) in answering Stack Overflow questions and demonstrate its capabilities. Additionally we discuss its capabilities in code summarization and generation as well as the impact of varying the volume of generated data on model performance. Notably SoTaNa can run on a single GPU making it accessible to a broader range of researchers. Our code model weights and data are public at (url)https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/SoTaNa\}.

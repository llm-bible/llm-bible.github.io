Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising potential in
providing empathetic support during interactions. However, their responses
often become verbose or overly formulaic, failing to adequately address the
diverse emotional support needs of real-world scenarios. To tackle this
challenge, we propose an innovative strategy-enhanced role-playing framework,
designed to simulate authentic emotional support conversations. Specifically,
our approach unfolds in two steps: (1) Strategy-Enhanced Role-Playing
Interactions, which involve three pivotal roles -- Seeker, Strategy Counselor,
and Supporter -- engaging in diverse scenarios to emulate real-world
interactions and promote a broader range of dialogues; and (2) Emotional
Support Agent Training, achieved through fine-tuning LLMs using our specially
constructed dataset. Within this framework, we develop the \textbf\{ServeForEmo\}
dataset, comprising an extensive collection of 3.7K+ multi-turn dialogues and
62.8K+ utterances. We further present \textbf\{SweetieChat\}, an emotional
support agent capable of handling diverse open-domain scenarios. Extensive
experiments and human evaluations confirm the framework's effectiveness in
enhancing emotional support, highlighting its unique ability to provide more
nuanced and tailored assistance.

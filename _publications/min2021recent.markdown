Large pre45;trained transformer45;based language models such as BERT have drastically changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. We present a survey of recent work that uses these large language models to solve NLP tasks via pre45;training then fine45;tuning prompting or text generation approaches. We also present approaches that use pre45;trained language models to generate data for training augmentation or other purposes. We conclude with discussions on limitations and suggested directions for future research.

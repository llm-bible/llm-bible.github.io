Large, pre-trained transformer-based language models such as BERT have
drastically changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field. We present a
survey of recent work that uses these large language models to solve NLP tasks
via pre-training then fine-tuning, prompting, or text generation approaches. We
also present approaches that use pre-trained language models to generate data
for training augmentation or other purposes. We conclude with discussions on
limitations and suggested directions for future research.

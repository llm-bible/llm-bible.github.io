While significant progress has been made in task-specific applications,
current models struggle with deep reasoning, generality, and adaptation -- key
components of System 2 reasoning that are crucial for achieving Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the promise of approaches such as program
synthesis, language models, and transformers, these methods often fail to
generalize beyond their training data and to adapt to novel tasks, limiting
their ability to perform human-like reasoning. This paper explores the
limitations of existing approaches in achieving advanced System 2 reasoning and
highlights the importance of generality and adaptation for AGI. Moreover, we
propose four key research directions to address these gaps: (1) learning human
intentions from action sequences, (2) combining symbolic and neural models, (3)
meta-learning for unfamiliar environments, and (4) reinforcement learning to
reason multi-step. Through these directions, we aim to advance the ability to
generalize and adapt, bringing computational models closer to the reasoning
capabilities required for AGI.

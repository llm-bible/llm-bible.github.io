In the past five years, research has shifted from traditional Machine
Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to leveraging Large Language
Models (LLMs) , including multimodality, for data augmentation to enhance
generalization, and combat overfitting in training deep convolutional neural
networks. However, while existing surveys predominantly focus on ML and DL
techniques or limited modalities (text or images), a gap remains in addressing
the latest advancements and multi-modal applications of LLM-based methods. This
survey fills that gap by exploring recent literature utilizing multimodal LLMs
to augment image, text, and audio data, offering a comprehensive understanding
of these processes. We outlined various methods employed in the LLM-based
image, text and speech augmentation, and discussed the limitations identified
in current approaches. Additionally, we identified potential solutions to these
limitations from the literature to enhance the efficacy of data augmentation
practices using multimodal LLMs. This survey serves as a foundation for future
research, aiming to refine and expand the use of multimodal LLMs in enhancing
dataset quality and diversity for deep learning applications. (Surveyed Paper

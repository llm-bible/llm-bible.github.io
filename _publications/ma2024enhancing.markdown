The integration of ChatGPT as a supportive tool in education, notably in
programming courses, addresses the unique challenges of programming education
by providing assistance with debugging, code generation, and explanations.
Despite existing research validating ChatGPT's effectiveness, its application
in university-level programming education and a detailed understanding of
student interactions and perspectives remain limited. This paper explores
ChatGPT's impact on learning in a Python programming course tailored for
first-year students over eight weeks. By analyzing responses from surveys,
open-ended questions, and student-ChatGPT dialog data, we aim to provide a
comprehensive view of ChatGPT's utility and identify both its advantages and
limitations as perceived by students. Our study uncovers a generally positive
reception toward ChatGPT and offers insights into its role in enhancing the
programming education experience. These findings contribute to the broader
discourse on AI's potential in education, suggesting paths for future research
and application.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable adaptability in
performing various tasks, including machine translation (MT), without explicit
training. Models such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Google's Gemini are frequently
evaluated on translation benchmarks and utilized as translation tools due to
their high performance. This paper examines Gemini's performance in translating
an 18th-century Ottoman Turkish manuscript, Prisoner of the Infidels: The
Memoirs of Osman Agha of Timisoara, into English. The manuscript recounts the
experiences of Osman Agha, an Ottoman subject who spent 11 years as a prisoner
of war in Austria, and includes his accounts of warfare and violence. Our
analysis reveals that Gemini's safety mechanisms flagged between 14 and 23
percent of the manuscript as harmful, resulting in untranslated passages. These
safety settings, while effective in mitigating potential harm, hinder the
model's ability to provide complete and accurate translations of historical
texts. Through real historical examples, this study highlights the inherent
challenges and limitations of current LLM safety implementations in the
handling of sensitive and context-rich materials. These real-world instances
underscore potential failures of LLMs in contemporary translation scenarios,
where accurate and comprehensive translations are crucial-for example,
translating the accounts of modern victims of war for legal proceedings or
humanitarian documentation.

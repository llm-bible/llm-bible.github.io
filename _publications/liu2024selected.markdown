Truthfulness stands out as an essential challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). Although many works have developed various ways for truthfulness
enhancement, they seldom focus on truthfulness in multilingual scenarios.
Meanwhile, contemporary multilingual aligning technologies struggle to balance
numerous languages and often exhibit serious truthfulness gaps across different
languages, especially those that differ greatly from English. In our work, we
extend truthfulness evaluation to multilingual contexts and propose a practical
method for cross-lingual truthfulness transfer called Fact-aware Multilingual
Selective Synergy (FaMSS). FaMSS is able to select an optimal subset of all
tested languages by language bias and transfer contributions, and then employ
translation instruction tuning for cross-lingual truthfulness transfer.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively reduce the
multilingual representation disparity and boost cross-lingual truthfulness
transfer of LLMs.

Pre45;trained Generative models such as BART T5 etc. have gained prominence as a preferred method for text generation in various natural language processing tasks including abstractive long45;form question answering (QA) and summarization. However the potential of generative models in extractive QA tasks where discriminative models are commonly employed remains largely unexplored. Discriminative models often encounter challenges associated with label sparsity particularly when only a small portion of the context contains the answer. The challenge is more pronounced for multi45;span answers. In this work we introduce a novel approach that uses the power of pre45;trained generative models to address extractive QA tasks by generating indexes corresponding to context tokens or sentences that form part of the answer. Through comprehensive evaluations on multiple extractive QA datasets including MultiSpanQA BioASQ MASHQA and WikiQA we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach compared to existing state45;of45;the45;art models.

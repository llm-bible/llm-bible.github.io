This research explores the quickly changing field of generative artificial
intelligence (GAI) chatbots in higher education, an industry that is undergoing
major technological changes. AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, HuggingChat, and
Google Bard, are becoming more and more common in a variety of sectors,
including education. Their acceptance is still in its early phases, with a
variety of prospects and obstacles. However, their potential in higher
education is particularly noteworthy, providing lecturers and students with
affordable, individualized support. Creating a comprehensive framework to aid
the usage of generative AI chatbots in higher education institutions (HEIs) is
the aim of this project. The Generative AI Chatbots Acceptance Model (GAICAM)
is the result of this study's synthesis of elements from well-known frameworks,
including the TAM, UTAUT2, TPB, and others along with variables like optimism,
innovativeness, discomfort, insecurity, and others. Using a research method
that encompasses a comprehensive analysis of extant literature from databases
such as IEEE, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, the study aims to
comprehend the implications of AI Chatbots on higher education and pinpoint
critical elements for their efficacious implementation. Peer-reviewed
English-language publications published between 2020 and 2023 with a focus on
the use of AI chatbots in higher education were the main focus of the search
criteria. The results demonstrate how much AI chatbots can do to improve
student engagement, streamline the educational process, and support
administrative and research duties. But there are also clear difficulties, such
as unfavorable student sentiments, doubts about the veracity of material
produced by AI, and unease and nervousness with new technologies.

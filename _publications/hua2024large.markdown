The integration of large language models (LLMs) in mental health care is an
emerging field. There is a need to systematically review the application
outcomes and delineate the advantages and limitations in clinical settings.
This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of LLMs in
mental health care, assessing their efficacy, challenges, and potential for
future applications. A systematic search was conducted across multiple
databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, arXiv, medRxiv, and
PsyArXiv in November 2023. All forms of original research, peer-reviewed or
not, published or disseminated between October 1, 2019, and December 2, 2023,
are included without language restrictions if they used LLMs developed after T5
and directly addressed research questions in mental health care settings. From
an initial pool of 313 articles, 34 met the inclusion criteria based on their
relevance to LLM application in mental health care and the robustness of
reported outcomes. Diverse applications of LLMs in mental health care are
identified, including diagnosis, therapy, patient engagement enhancement, etc.
Key challenges include data availability and reliability, nuanced handling of
mental states, and effective evaluation methods. Despite successes in accuracy
and accessibility improvement, gaps in clinical applicability and ethical
considerations were evident, pointing to the need for robust data, standardized
evaluations, and interdisciplinary collaboration. LLMs hold substantial promise
for enhancing mental health care. For their full potential to be realized,
emphasis must be placed on developing robust datasets, development and
evaluation frameworks, ethical guidelines, and interdisciplinary collaborations
to address current limitations.

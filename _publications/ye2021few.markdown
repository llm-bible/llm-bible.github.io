Humans can learn a new language task efficiently with only few examples by leveraging their knowledge obtained when learning prior tasks. In this paper we explore whether and how such cross45;task generalization ability can be acquired and further applied to build better few45;shot learners across diverse NLP tasks. We introduce CrossFit a problem setup for studying cross45;task generalization ability which standardizes seen/unseen task partitions data access during different learning stages and the evaluation protocols. To instantiate different seen/unseen task partitions in CrossFit and facilitate in45;depth analysis we present the NLP Few45;shot Gym a repository of 160 diverse few45;shot NLP tasks created from open45;access NLP datasets and converted to a unified text45;to45;text format. Our analysis reveals that the few45;shot learning ability on unseen tasks can be improved via an upstream learning stage using a set of seen tasks. We also observe that the selection of upstream learning tasks can significantly influence few45;shot performance on unseen tasks asking further analysis on task similarity and transferability.

LLM-based applications are helping people write, and LLM-generated text is
making its way into social media, journalism, and our classrooms. However, the
differences between LLM-generated and human written text remain unclear. To
explore this, we hired professional writers to edit paragraphs in several
creative domains. We first found these writers agree on undesirable
idiosyncrasies in LLM generated text, formalizing it into a seven-category
taxonomy (e.g. clich\'es, unnecessary exposition). Second, we curated the LAMP
corpus: 1,057 LLM-generated paragraphs edited by professional writers according
to our taxonomy. Analysis of LAMP reveals that none of the LLMs used in our
study (GPT4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Llama-3.1-70b) outperform each other in terms
of writing quality, revealing common limitations across model families. Third,
building on existing work in automatic editing we evaluated methods to improve
LLM-generated text. A large-scale preference annotation confirms that although
experts largely prefer text edited by other experts, automatic editing methods
show promise in improving alignment between LLM-generated and human-written
text.

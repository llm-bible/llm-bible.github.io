Ambiguity resolution is key to effective communication. While humans
effortlessly address ambiguity through conversational grounding strategies, the
extent to which current language models can emulate these strategies remains
unclear. In this work, we examine referential ambiguity in image-based question
answering by introducing RACQUET, a carefully curated dataset targeting
distinct aspects of ambiguity. Through a series of evaluations, we reveal
significant limitations and problems of overconfidence of state-of-the-art
large multimodal language models in addressing ambiguity in their responses.
The overconfidence issue becomes particularly relevant for RACQUET-BIAS, a
subset designed to analyze a critical yet underexplored problem: failing to
address ambiguity leads to stereotypical, socially biased responses. Our
results underscore the urgency of equipping models with robust strategies to
deal with uncertainty without resorting to undesirable stereotypes.

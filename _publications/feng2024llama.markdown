Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have seen Large45;scale Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing high45;quality text for various purposes. Notably in Text45;To45;Speech (TTS) systems the integration of BERT for semantic token generation has underscored the importance of semantic content in producing coherent speech outputs. Despite this the specific utility of LLMs in enhancing TTS synthesis remains considerably limited. This research introduces an innovative approach Llama45;VITS which enhances TTS synthesis by enriching the semantic content of text using LLM. Llama45;VITS integrates semantic embeddings from Llama2 with the VITS model a leading end45;to45;end TTS framework. By leveraging Llama2 for the primary speech synthesis process our experiments demonstrate that Llama45;VITS matches the naturalness of the original VITS (ORI45;VITS) and those incorporate BERT (BERT45;VITS) on the LJSpeech dataset a substantial collection of neutral clear speech. Moreover our method significantly enhances emotive expressiveness on the EmoV95;DB95;bea95;sem dataset a curated selection of emotionally consistent speech from the EmoV95;DB dataset highlighting its potential to generate emotive speech.

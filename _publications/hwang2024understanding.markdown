Leveraging generative AI (for example, Large Language Models) for language
understanding within robotics opens up possibilities for LLM-driven robot
end-user development (EUD). Despite the numerous design opportunities it
provides, little is understood about how this technology can be utilized when
constructing robot program logic. In this paper, we outline the background in
capturing natural language end-user intent and summarize previous use cases of
LLMs within EUD. Taking the context of filmmaking as an example, we explore how
a cinematography practitioner's intent to film a certain scene can be
articulated using natural language, captured by an LLM, and further
parametrized as low-level robot arm movement. We explore the capabilities of an
LLM interpreting end-user intent and mapping natural language to predefined,
cross-modal data in the process of iterative program development. We conclude
by suggesting future opportunities for domain exploration beyond cinematography
to support language-driven robotic camera navigation.

Although large language models (LLMs) have transformed our expectations of
modern language technologies, concerns over data privacy often restrict the use
of commercially available LLMs hosted outside of EU jurisdictions. This limits
their application in governmental, defence, and other data-sensitive sectors.
In this work, we evaluate the extent to which locally deployable open-weight
LLMs support lesser-spoken languages such as Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian.
We examine various size and precision variants of the top-performing
multilingual open-weight models, Llama~3, Gemma~2, Phi, and NeMo, on machine
translation, multiple-choice question answering, and free-form text generation.
The results indicate that while certain models like Gemma~2 perform close to
the top commercially available models, many LLMs struggle with these languages.
Most surprisingly, however, we find that these models, while showing close to
state-of-the-art translation performance, are still prone to lexical
hallucinations with errors in at least 1 in 20 words for all open-weight
multilingual LLMs.

Controlled text generation (CTG) seeks to guide large language model (LLM)
output to produce text that conforms to desired criteria. The current study
presents a novel CTG algorithm that enforces adherence toward specific
rhetorical relations in an LLM sentence-completion context by a parser-driven
decoding scheme that requires no model fine-tuning. The method is validated
both with automatic and human evaluation. The code is accessible on GitHub.

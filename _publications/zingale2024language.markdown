Controlled text generation (CTG) seeks to guide large language model (LLM) output to produce text that conforms to desired criteria. The current study presents a novel CTG algorithm that enforces adherence toward specific rhetorical relations in an LLM sentence45;completion context by a parser45;driven decoding scheme that requires no model fine45;tuning. The method is validated both with automatic and human evaluation. The code is accessible on GitHub.

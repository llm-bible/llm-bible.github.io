In this paper we explore the application of Generative Pre45;trained Transformers (GPTs) in cross45;lingual legal Question45;Answering (QA) systems using the COLIEE Task 4 dataset. In the COLIEE Task 4 given a statement and a set of related legal articles that serve as context the objective is to determine whether the statement is legally valid i.e. if it can be inferred from the provided contextual articles or not which is also known as an entailment task. By benchmarking four different combinations of English and Japanese prompts and data we provide valuable insights into GPTs performance in multilingual legal QA scenarios contributing to the development of more efficient and accurate cross45;lingual QA solutions in the legal domain.

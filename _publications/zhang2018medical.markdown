Reading and understanding text is one important component in computer aided
diagnosis in clinical medicine, also being a major research problem in the
field of NLP. In this work, we introduce a question-answering task called MedQA
to study answering questions in clinical medicine using knowledge in a
large-scale document collection. The aim of MedQA is to answer real-world
questions with large-scale reading comprehension. We propose our solution
SeaReader--a modular end-to-end reading comprehension model based on LSTM
networks and dual-path attention architecture. The novel dual-path attention
models information flow from two perspectives and has the ability to
simultaneously read individual documents and integrate information across
multiple documents. In experiments our SeaReader achieved a large increase in
accuracy on MedQA over competing models. Additionally, we develop a series of
novel techniques to demonstrate the interpretation of the question answering
process in SeaReader.

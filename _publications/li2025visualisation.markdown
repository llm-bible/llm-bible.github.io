Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning processes are challenging to analyze
due to their complexity and the lack of organized visualization tools. We
present ReasonGraph, a web-based platform for visualizing and analyzing LLM
reasoning processes. It supports both sequential and tree-based reasoning
methods while integrating with major LLM providers and over fifty
state-of-the-art models. ReasonGraph incorporates an intuitive UI with meta
reasoning method selection, configurable visualization parameters, and a
modular framework that facilitates efficient extension. Our evaluation shows
high parsing reliability, efficient processing, and strong usability across
various downstream applications. By providing a unified visualization
framework, ReasonGraph reduces cognitive load in analyzing complex reasoning
paths, improves error detection in logical processes, and enables more
effective development of LLM-based applications. The platform is open-source,
promoting accessibility and reproducibility in LLM reasoning analysis.

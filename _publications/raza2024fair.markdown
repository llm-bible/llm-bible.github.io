The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the necessity for ethical considerations and data integrity in AI development particularly emphasizing the role of FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable Reusable) data principles. While these principles are crucial for ethical data stewardship their specific application in the context of LLM training data remains an under-explored area. This research gap is the focus of our study which begins with an examination of existing literature to underline the importance of FAIR principles in managing data for LLM training. Building upon this we propose a novel framework designed to integrate FAIR principles into the LLM development lifecycle. A contribution of our work is the development of a comprehensive checklist intended to guide researchers and developers in applying FAIR data principles consistently across the model development process. The utility and effectiveness of our framework are validated through a case study on creating a FAIR-compliant dataset aimed at detecting and mitigating biases in LLMs. We present this framework to the community as a tool to foster the creation of technologically advanced ethically grounded and socially responsible AI models.

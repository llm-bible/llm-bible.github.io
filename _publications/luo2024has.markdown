Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
their scalability raises a critical question: Have we reached the scaling
ceiling? This paper addresses this pivotal question by developing a unified
theoretical framework that integrates mathematical and statistical insights to
explain the scaling dynamics of LLMs. We present: 1. Central Limit Theorem
(CLT) for Hidden Representations: We show that noise in hidden representations
scales inversely with context size, explaining stabilization effects and the
limits of context length improvements. 2. Bias-Variance Decomposition: We
decompose next-token prediction loss into irreducible entropy, capacity-driven
bias, and finite sample variance, revealing trade-offs where scaling yields
diminishing returns. 3. Emergent SNR Thresholds: By defining signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), we quantify how capabilities emerge abruptly once SNR surpasses a
threshold, offering insights into when scaling becomes less effective. Through
this framework, we conclude that while LLMs have not reached an absolute
scaling ceiling, practical constraints are increasingly prominent: diminishing
returns, resource inefficiencies, and data limitations. Future progress will
require a shift from brute-force scaling to innovations in architecture, data
quality, and training paradigms. This work provides a roadmap for guiding the
efficient development of next-generation LLMs and advancing the field beyond
traditional scaling strategies.

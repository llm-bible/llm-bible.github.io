We show that a character45;level encoder45;decoder framework can be successfully applied to question answering with a structured knowledge base. We use our model for single45;relation question answering and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the SimpleQuestions dataset (Bordes et al. 2015) where we improve state45;of45;the45;art accuracy from 63.937; to 70.937; without use of ensembles. Importantly our character45;level model has 16x fewer parameters than an equivalent word45;level model can be learned with significantly less data compared to previous work which relies on data augmentation and is robust to new entities in testing.

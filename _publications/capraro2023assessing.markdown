Generative artificial intelligence (AI) holds enormous potential to revolutionize decision45;making processes from everyday to high45;stake scenarios. By leveraging generative AI humans can benefit from data45;driven insights and predictions enhancing their ability to make informed decisions that consider a wide array of factors and potential outcomes. However as many decisions carry social implications for AI to be a reliable assistant for decision45;making it is crucial that it is able to capture the balance between self45;interest and the interest of others. We investigate the ability of three of the most advanced chatbots to predict dictator game decisions across 108 experiments with human participants from 12 countries. We find that only GPT45;4 (not Bard nor Bing) correctly captures qualitative behavioral patterns identifying three major classes of behavior self45;interested inequity45;averse and fully altruistic. Nonetheless GPT45;4 consistently underestimates self45;interest and inequity45;aversion while overestimating altruistic behavior. This bias has significant implications for AI developers and users as overly optimistic expectations about human altruism may lead to disappointment frustration suboptimal decisions in public policy or business contexts and even social conflict.

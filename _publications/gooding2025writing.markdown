Open-ended tasks are particularly challenging for LLMs due to the vast
solution space, demanding both expansive exploration and adaptable strategies,
especially when success lacks a clear, objective definition. Writing, with its
vast solution space and subjective evaluation criteria, provides a compelling
testbed for studying such problems. In this paper, we investigate the potential
of LLMs to act as collaborative co-writers, capable of suggesting and
implementing text improvements autonomously. We analyse three prominent LLMs -
Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and GPT-4o - focusing on how their action
diversity, human alignment, and iterative improvement capabilities impact
overall performance. This work establishes a framework for benchmarking
autonomous writing agents and, more broadly, highlights fundamental challenges
and potential solutions for building systems capable of excelling in diverse
open-ended domains.

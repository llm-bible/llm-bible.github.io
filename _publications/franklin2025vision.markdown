Vision generation remains a challenging frontier in artificial intelligence,
requiring seamless integration of visual understanding and generative
capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Vision-Driven Prompt
Optimization (VDPO), that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically
generate textual prompts from visual inputs, guiding high-fidelity image
synthesis. VDPO combines a visual embedding prompt tuner, a textual instruction
generator, and a vision generation module to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in diverse vision generation tasks. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks such as COCO and Sketchy demonstrate that VDPO consistently
outperforms existing methods, achieving significant improvements in FID, LPIPS,
and BLEU/CIDEr scores. Additional analyses reveal the scalability, robustness,
and generalization capabilities of VDPO, making it a versatile solution for
in-domain and out-of-domain tasks. Human evaluations further validate the
practical superiority of VDPO in generating visually appealing and semantically
coherent outputs.

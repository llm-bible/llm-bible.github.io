This report analyzes the potential for large language models (LLMs) to expedite accurate replication of published message effects studies. We tested LLM45;powered participants (personas) by replicating 133 experimental findings from 14 papers containing 45 recent studies in the Journal of Marketing (January 202345;May 2024). We used a new software tool Viewpoints AI (https://viewpoints.ai/), that takes study designs stimuli and measures as input automatically generates prompts for LLMs to act as a specified sample of unique personas and collects their responses to produce a final output in the form of a complete dataset and statistical analysis. The underlying LLM used was Anthropics Claude Sonnet 3.5. We generated 19447 AI personas to replicate these studies with the exact same sample attributes study designs stimuli and measures reported in the original human research. Our LLM replications successfully reproduced 7637; of the original main effects (84 out of 111) demonstrating strong potential for AI45;assisted replication of studies in which people respond to media stimuli. When including interaction effects the overall replication rate was 6837; (90 out of 133). The use of LLMs to replicate and accelerate marketing research on media effects is discussed with respect to the replication crisis in social science potential solutions to generalizability problems in sampling subjects and experimental conditions and the ability to rapidly test consumer responses to various media stimuli. We also address the limitations of this approach particularly in replicating complex interaction effects in media response studies and suggest areas for future research and improvement in AI45;assisted experimental replication of media effects.

Neurosymbolic approaches can add robustness to opaque neural systems by
incorporating explainable symbolic representations. However, previous
approaches have not used formal logic to contextualize queries to and validate
outputs of large language models (LLMs). We propose \systemname\{\}, a novel
neurosymbolic framework, to improve the robustness and reliability of LLMs in
question-answering tasks. We provide \systemname\{\} with a domain-specific
knowledge base, a logical reasoning system, and an integration to an existing
LLM. This framework has two capabilities (1) context gathering: generating
explainable and relevant context for a given query, and (2) validation:
confirming and validating the factual accuracy of a statement in accordance
with a knowledge base (KB). Our work opens a new area of neurosymbolic
generative AI text validation and user personalization.

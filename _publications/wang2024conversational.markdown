Simultaneous machine translation (SimulMT) presents a challenging trade45;off between translation quality and latency. Recent studies have shown that LLMs can achieve good performance in SimulMT tasks. However this often comes at the expense of high inference cost and latency. In this paper we propose a conversational SimulMT framework to enhance the inference efficiency of LLM45;based SimulMT through multi45;turn45;dialogue45;based decoding. Our experiments with Llama245;7b45;chat on two SimulMT benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of LLM in translation quality while achieving comparable computational latency to specialized SimulMT models.

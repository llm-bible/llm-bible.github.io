The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly impacted various domains including healthcare and biomedicine. However the phenomenon of hallucination where LLMs generate outputs that deviate from factual accuracy or context poses a critical challenge especially in high-stakes domains. This paper conducts a scoping study of existing techniques for mitigating hallucinations in knowledge-based task in general and especially for medical domains. Key methods covered in the paper include Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based techniques iterative feedback loops supervised fine-tuning and prompt engineering. These techniques while promising in general contexts require further adaptation and optimization for the medical domain due to its unique demands for up-to-date specialized knowledge and strict adherence to medical guidelines. Addressing these challenges is crucial for developing trustworthy AI systems that enhance clinical decision-making and patient safety as well as accuracy of biomedical scientific research.

The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly focused on
high-resource languages, leaving low-resource languages, such as those in the
Finno-Ugric family, significantly underrepresented. This paper addresses this
gap by focusing on V\~oro, Livonian, and Komi. We cover almost the entire cycle
of LLM creation, from data collection to instruction tuning and evaluation. Our
contributions include developing multilingual base and instruction-tuned
models; creating evaluation benchmarks, including the smugri-MT-bench
multi-turn conversational benchmark; and conducting human evaluation. We intend
for this work to promote linguistic diversity, ensuring that lesser-resourced
languages can benefit from advancements in NLP.

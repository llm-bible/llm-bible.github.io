We present new data and semantic parsing methods for the problem of mapping english sentences to Bash commands (NL2Bash). Our long-term goal is to enable any user to easily solve otherwise repetitive tasks (such as file manipulation, search, and application-specific scripting) by simply stating their intents in English. We take a first step in this domain, by providing a large new dataset of challenging but commonly used commands paired with their English descriptions, along with the baseline methods to establish performance levels on this task.

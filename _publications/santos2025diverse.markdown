Prompt engineering is essential for optimizing large language models (LLMs),
yet the link between prompt structures and task performance remains
underexplored. This work introduces an evolutionary approach that combines
context-free grammar (CFG) with the MAP-Elites algorithm to systematically
explore the prompt space. Our method prioritizes quality and diversity,
generating high-performing and structurally varied prompts while analyzing
their alignment with diverse tasks by varying traits such as the number of
examples (shots) and reasoning depth. By systematically mapping the phenotypic
space, we reveal how structural variations influence LLM performance, offering
actionable insights for task-specific and adaptable prompt design. Evaluated on
seven BigBench Lite tasks across multiple LLMs, our results underscore the
critical interplay of quality and diversity, advancing the effectiveness and
versatility of LLMs.

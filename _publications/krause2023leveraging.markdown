This paper discusses our approaches for task-oriented conversational modelling using subjective knowledge with a particular emphasis on response generation. Our methodology was shaped by an extensive data analysis that evaluated key factors such as response length sentiment and dialogue acts present in the provided dataset. We used few-shot learning to augment the data with newly generated subjective knowledge items and present three approaches for DSTC11 (1) task-specific model exploration (2) incorporation of the most frequent question into all generated responses and (3) a waterfall prompting technique using a combination of both GPT-3 and ChatGPT.

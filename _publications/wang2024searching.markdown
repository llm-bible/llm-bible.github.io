Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques have proven to be effective
in integrating up-to-date information, mitigating hallucinations, and enhancing
response quality, particularly in specialized domains. While many RAG
approaches have been proposed to enhance large language models through
query-dependent retrievals, these approaches still suffer from their complex
implementation and prolonged response times. Typically, a RAG workflow involves
multiple processing steps, each of which can be executed in various ways. Here,
we investigate existing RAG approaches and their potential combinations to
identify optimal RAG practices. Through extensive experiments, we suggest
several strategies for deploying RAG that balance both performance and
efficiency. Moreover, we demonstrate that multimodal retrieval techniques can
significantly enhance question-answering capabilities about visual inputs and
accelerate the generation of multimodal content using a "retrieval as
generation" strategy.

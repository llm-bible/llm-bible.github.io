This paper conducts a longitudinal study over eleven months to address the
limitations of prior research on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard, which have relied
on empirical studies with restricted observation periods of only five months.
By extending the analysis duration, we aim to provide a more comprehensive
understanding of the progression in developing Korean large language models
(LLMs). Our study is guided by three primary research questions: (1) What are
the specific challenges in improving LLM performance across diverse tasks on
the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard over time? (2) How does model size impact task
performance correlations across various benchmarks? (3) How have the patterns
in leaderboard rankings shifted over time on the Open Ko-LLM Leaderboard?. By
analyzing 1,769 models over this period, our research offers a comprehensive
examination of the ongoing advancements in LLMs and the evolving nature of
evaluation frameworks.

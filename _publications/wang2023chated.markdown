With the rapid evolution of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have emerged as powerful tools capable of transforming various sectors. Their vast knowledge base and dynamic interaction capabilities represent significant potential in improving education by operating as a personalized assistant. However the possibility of generating incorrect biased or unhelpful answers are a key challenge to resolve when deploying LLMs in an education context. This work introduces an innovative architecture that combines the strengths of ChatGPT with a traditional information retrieval based chatbot framework to offer enhanced student support in higher education. Our empirical evaluations underscore the high promise of this approach.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown nearly saturated performance on many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As a result it is natural for people to believe that LLMs have also mastered abilities such as time understanding and reasoning. However research on the temporal sensitivity of LLMs has been insufficiently emphasized. To fill this gap this paper constructs Multiple Sensitive Factors Time QA (MenatQA) which encompasses three temporal factors (scope factor order factor counterfactual factor) with total 2853 samples for evaluating the time comprehension and reasoning abilities of LLMs. This paper tests current mainstream LLMs with different parameter sizes ranging from billions to hundreds of billions. The results show most LLMs fall behind smaller temporal reasoning models with different degree on these factors. In specific LLMs show a significant vulnerability to temporal biases and depend heavily on the temporal information provided in questions. Furthermore this paper undertakes a preliminary investigation into potential improvement strategies by devising specific prompts and leveraging external tools. These approaches serve as valuable baselines or references for future research endeavors.

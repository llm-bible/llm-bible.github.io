Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in tasks such as
psychological text analysis and decision-making in automated workflows.
However, their reliability remains a concern due to potential biases inherited
from their training process. In this study, we examine how different response
format: binary versus continuous, may systematically influence LLMs' judgments.
In a value statement judgments task and a text sentiment analysis task, we
prompted LLMs to simulate human responses and tested both formats across
several models, including both open-source and commercial models. Our findings
revealed a consistent negative bias: LLMs were more likely to deliver
"negative" judgments in binary formats compared to continuous ones. Control
experiments further revealed that this pattern holds across both tasks. Our
results highlight the importance of considering response format when applying
LLMs to decision tasks, as small changes in task design can introduce
systematic biases.

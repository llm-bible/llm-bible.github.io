With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence, particularly in
Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pivotal
in educational question-answering systems, especially university admission
chatbots. Concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and other
advanced techniques have been developed to enhance these systems by integrating
specific university data, enabling LLMs to provide informed responses on
admissions and academic counseling. However, these enhanced RAG techniques
often involve high operational costs and require the training of complex,
specialized modules, which poses challenges for practical deployment.
Additionally, in the educational context, it is crucial to provide accurate
answers to prevent misinformation, a task that LLM-based systems find
challenging without appropriate strategies and methods. In this paper, we
introduce the Unified RAG (URAG) Framework, a hybrid approach that
significantly improves the accuracy of responses, particularly for critical
queries. Experimental results demonstrate that URAG enhances our in-house,
lightweight model to perform comparably to state-of-the-art commercial models.
Moreover, to validate its practical applicability, we conducted a case study at
our educational institution, which received positive feedback and acclaim. This
study not only proves the effectiveness of URAG but also highlights its
feasibility for real-world implementation in educational settings.

This paper introduces 26 guiding principles designed to streamline the
process of querying and prompting large language models. Our goal is to
simplify the underlying concepts of formulating questions for various scales of
large language models, examining their abilities, and enhancing user
comprehension on the behaviors of different scales of large language models
when feeding into different prompts. Extensive experiments are conducted on
LLaMA-1/2 (7B, 13B and 70B), GPT-3.5/4 to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed principles on instructions and prompts design. We hope that this work
can provide a better guide for researchers working on the prompting of large
language models. Project page is available at

When a human asks questions online, or when a conversational virtual agent
asks human questions, questions triggering emotions or with details might more
likely to get responses or answers. we explore how to automatically rewrite
natural language questions to improve the response rate from people. In
particular, a new task of Visual Question Rewriting(VQR) task is introduced to
explore how visual information can be used to improve the new questions. A data
set containing around 4K bland questions, attractive questions and images
triples is collected. We developed some baseline sequence to sequence models
and more advanced transformer based models, which take a bland question and a
related image as input and output a rewritten question that is expected to be
more attractive. Offline experiments and mechanical Turk based evaluations show
that it is possible to rewrite bland questions in a more detailed and
attractive way to increase the response rate, and images can be helpful.

Serving large language models (LLMs) in production can incur substantial costs which has prompted recent advances in inference system optimizations. Today these systems are evaluated against conventional latency and throughput metrics (eg. TTFT TBT Normalised Latency and TPOT). However these metrics fail to fully capture the nuances of LLM inference leading to an incomplete assessment of user45;facing performance crucial for real45;time applications such as chat and translation. In this paper we first identify the pitfalls of current performance metrics in evaluating LLM inference systems. We then propose Etalon a comprehensive performance evaluation framework that includes fluidity45;index 45;45; a novel metric designed to reflect the intricacies of the LLM inference process and its impact on real45;time user experience. Finally we evaluate various existing open45;source platforms and model45;as45;a45;service offerings using Etalon discussing their strengths and weaknesses. Etalon is available at https://github.com/project&#45;etalon/etalon.

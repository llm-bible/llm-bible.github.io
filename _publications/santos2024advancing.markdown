To advance the neural decoding of Portuguese in this paper we present a fully open Transformer-based instruction-tuned decoder model that sets a new state of the art in this respect. To develop this decoder which we named Gervasio PT a strong LLaMA~2 7B model was used as a starting point and its further improvement through additional training was done over language resources that include new instruction data sets of Portuguese prepared for this purpose which are also contributed in this paper. All versions of Gervasio are open source and distributed for free under an open license including for either research or commercial usage and can be run on consumer-grade hardware thus seeking to contribute to the advancement of research and innovation in language technology for Portuguese.

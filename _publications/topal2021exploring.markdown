Recent years have seen a proliferation of attention mechanisms and the rise of Transformers in Natural Language Generation (NLG). Previously state-of-the-art NLG architectures such as RNN and LSTM ran into vanishing gradient problems; as sentences grew larger distance between positions remained linear and sequential computation hindered parallelization since sentences were processed word by word. Transformers usher in a new era. In this paper we explore three major Transformer-based models namely GPT BERT and XLNet that carry significant implications for the field. NLG is a burgeoning area that is now bolstered with rapid developments in attention mechanisms. From poetry generation to summarization text generation derives benefit as Transformer-based language models achieve groundbreaking results.

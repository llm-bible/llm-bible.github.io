We introduce Radiology-GPT, a large language model for radiology. Using an
instruction tuning approach on an extensive dataset of radiology domain
knowledge, Radiology-GPT demonstrates superior performance compared to general
language models such as StableLM, Dolly and LLaMA. It exhibits significant
versatility in radiological diagnosis, research, and communication. This work
serves as a catalyst for future developments in clinical NLP. The successful
implementation of Radiology-GPT is indicative of the potential of localizing
generative large language models, specifically tailored for distinctive medical
specialties, while ensuring adherence to privacy standards such as HIPAA. The
prospect of developing individualized, large-scale language models that cater
to specific needs of various hospitals presents a promising direction. The
fusion of conversational competence and domain-specific knowledge in these
models is set to foster future development in healthcare AI. A demo of
Radiology-GPT is available at

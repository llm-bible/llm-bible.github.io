We present Quasar-1, a novel architecture that introduces temperature-guided
reasoning to large language models through the Token Temperature Mechanism
(TTM) and Guided Sequence of Thought (GSoT). Our approach leverages the concept
of hot and cold tokens, where hot tokens are prioritized for their contextual
relevance, while cold tokens provide supplementary information. This dynamic
modulation of token importance enables the model to achieve superior logical
reasoning capabilities compared to traditional chain-of-thought approaches.
Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we prove that our temperature-guided
attention mechanism converges to optimal reasoning paths with exponential
guarantees. Empirical results show significant improvements in reasoning
accuracy and computational efficiency across a wide range of tasks, making
advanced AI reasoning accessible to a broader range of applications.

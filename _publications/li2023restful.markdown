We present SkillGPT, a tool for skill extraction and standardization (SES)
from free-style job descriptions and user profiles with an open-source Large
Language Model (LLM) as backbone. Most previous methods for similar tasks
either need supervision or rely on heavy data-preprocessing and feature
engineering. Directly prompting the latest conversational LLM for standard
skills, however, is slow, costly and inaccurate. In contrast, SkillGPT utilizes
a LLM to perform its tasks in steps via summarization and vector similarity
search, to balance speed with precision. The backbone LLM of SkillGPT is based
on Llama, free for academic use and thus useful for exploratory research and
prototype development. Hence, our cost-free SkillGPT gives users the
convenience of conversational SES, efficiently and reliably.

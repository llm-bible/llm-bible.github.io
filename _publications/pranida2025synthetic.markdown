Quantifying reasoning capability in low-resource languages remains a
challenge in NLP due to data scarcity and limited access to annotators. While
LLM-assisted dataset construction has proven useful for medium- and
high-resource languages, its effectiveness in low-resource languages,
particularly for commonsense reasoning, is still unclear. In this paper, we
compare three dataset creation strategies: (1) LLM-assisted dataset generation,
(2) machine translation, and (3) human-written data by native speakers, to
build a culturally nuanced story comprehension dataset. We focus on Javanese
and Sundanese, two major local languages in Indonesia, and evaluate the
effectiveness of open-weight and closed-weight LLMs in assisting dataset
creation through extensive manual validation. To assess the utility of
synthetic data, we fine-tune language models on classification and generation
tasks using this data and evaluate performance on a human-written test set. Our
findings indicate that LLM-assisted data creation outperforms machine
translation.

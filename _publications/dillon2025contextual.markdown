Memory retention challenges in deep neural architectures have ongoing
limitations in the ability to process and recall extended contextual
information. Token dependencies degrade as sequence length increases, leading
to a decline in coherence and factual consistency across longer outputs. A
structured approach is introduced to mitigate this issue through the reweaving
of latent states captured at different processing layers, reinforcing token
representations over extended sequences. The proposed Contextual Memory
Reweaving framework incorporates a Layered Latent State Reconstruction
mechanism to systematically integrate past contextual embeddings without
introducing external memory modules. Experimental results demonstrate
improvements in recall accuracy across a range of sequence lengths, with
notable gains in the retention of rarely occurring tokens and numerical
reasoning consistency. Further analysis of computational efficiency indicates
that the additional processing overhead remains within acceptable thresholds,
enabling scalability across different model sizes. Evaluations in long-form
text generation and ambiguous query resolution highlight the capacity of memory
reweaving to enhance continuity and reduce inconsistencies over extended
outputs. Attention weight distributions reveal more structured allocation
patterns, suggesting that reweaved latent states contribute to improved
contextual awareness. The findings establish a framework for refining memory
retention mechanisms in language models, addressing long-standing challenges in
handling complex, multi-step reasoning tasks.

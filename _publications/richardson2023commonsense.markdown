Large transformer-based pretrained language models like BERT GPT and T5 have demonstrated a deep understanding of contextual semantics and language syntax. Their success has enabled significant advances in conversational AI including the development of open-dialogue systems capable of coherent salient conversations which can answer questions chat casually and complete tasks. However state-of-the-art models still struggle with tasks that involve higher levels of reasoning - including commonsense reasoning that humans find trivial. This paper presents a survey of recent conversational AI research focused on commonsense reasoning. The paper lists relevant training datasets and describes the primary approaches to include commonsense in conversational AI. The paper also discusses benchmarks used for evaluating commonsense in conversational AI problems. Finally the paper presents preliminary observations of the limited commonsense capabilities of two state-of-the-art open dialogue models BlenderBot3 and LaMDA and its negative effect on natural interactions. These observations further motivate research on commonsense reasoning in conversational AI.

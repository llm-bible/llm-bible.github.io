Service chatbots play an important role in enhancing customer support by
delivering timely responses to diverse queries. Traditionally, these chatbots
rely on retrieval-based methods constrained by a predefined knowledge base of
question-answer (QA) pairs to guarantee reliable responses. To effectively
handle varied customer inquiries, augmenting the knowledge base with similar
questions that maintain semantic consistency and linguistic variability is
crucial. This paper presents methodologies for a novel approach that utilizes
Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating similar questions and selecting an
optimal subset of questions for knowledge base augmentation in industrial
chatbots. Specifically, we define the SQG task in the context of LLM training
and propose a one-to-many objective that incorporates contextual information.
We also introduce an optimization framework that selects a diverse subset of
similar questions within predefined resource constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements over traditional methods, achieving
greater semantic diversity while aligning with source QA pairs, with over 120%
relative improvement in meeting business-specific requirements with human
evaluation. Combined with several best practices, we provide a robust,
application-driven solution for enhancing chatbot performance and improving
customer service satisfaction.

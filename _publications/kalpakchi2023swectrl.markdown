We present SweCTRL-Mini a large Swedish language model that can be used for inference and fine-tuning on a single consumer-grade GPU. The model is based on the CTRL architecture by Keskar McCann Varshney Xiong and Socher (2019) which means that users of the SweCTRL-Mini model can control the genre of the generated text by inserting special tokens in the generation prompts. SweCTRL-Mini is trained on a subset of the Swedish part of the mC4 corpus and a set of Swedish novels. In this article we provide (1) a detailed account of the utilized training data and text pre-processing steps to the extent that it is possible to check whether a specific phrase/source was a part of the training data and (2) an evaluation of the model on both discriminative tasks using automatic evaluation methods and generative tasks using human referees. We also compare the generative capabilities of the model with those of GPT-3. SweCTRL-Mini is fully open and available for download.

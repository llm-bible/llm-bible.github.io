Recently text world games have been proposed to enable artificial agents to understand and reason about real45;world scenarios. These text45;based games are challenging for artificial agents as it requires an understanding of and interaction using natural language in a partially observable environment. Agents observe the environment via textual descriptions designed to be challenging enough for even human players. Past approaches have not paid enough attention to the language understanding capability of the proposed agents. Typically these approaches train from scratch an agent that learns both textual representations and the gameplay online during training using a temporal loss function. Given the sample45;inefficiency of RL approaches it is inefficient to learn rich enough textual representations to be able to understand and reason using the textual observation in such a complicated game environment setting. In this paper we improve the semantic understanding of the agent by proposing a simple RL with LM framework where we use transformer45;based language models with Deep RL models. We perform a detailed study of our framework to demonstrate how our model outperforms all existing agents on the popular game Zork1 to achieve a score of 44.7 which is 1.6 higher than the state45;of45;the45;art model. Overall our proposed approach outperforms 4 games out of the 14 text45;based games while performing comparable to the state45;of45;the45;art models on the remaining games.

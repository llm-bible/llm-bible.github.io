This study investigates the efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
interactive language therapy for high-functioning autistic adolescents. With
the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, particularly in natural
language processing, LLMs present a novel opportunity to augment traditional
psychological counseling methods. This research primarily focuses on evaluating
the LLM's ability to engage in empathetic, adaptable, and contextually
appropriate interactions within a therapeutic setting. A comprehensive
evaluation was conducted by a panel of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
using a specially developed scorecard. The assessment covered various aspects
of the LLM's performance, including empathy, communication skills,
adaptability, engagement, and the ability to establish a therapeutic alliance.
The study avoided direct testing with patients, prioritizing privacy and
ethical considerations, and instead relied on simulated scenarios to gauge the
LLM's effectiveness. The results indicate that LLMs hold significant promise as
supportive tools in therapy, demonstrating strengths in empathetic engagement
and adaptability in conversation. However, challenges in achieving the depth of
personalization and emotional understanding characteristic of human therapists
were noted. The study also highlights the importance of ethical considerations
in the application of AI in therapeutic contexts. This research provides
valuable insights into the potential and limitations of using LLMs in
psychological counseling for autistic adolescents. It lays the groundwork for
future explorations into AI's role in mental health care, emphasizing the need
for ongoing development to enhance the capabilities of these models in
therapeutic settings.

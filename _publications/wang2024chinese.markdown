Metaphors are common in everyday language, and the identification and
understanding of metaphors are facilitated by models to achieve a better
understanding of the text. Metaphors are mainly identified and generated by
pre-trained models in existing research, but situations, where tenors or
vehicles are not included in the metaphor, cannot be handled. The problem can
be effectively solved by using Large Language Models (LLMs), but significant
room for exploration remains in this early-stage research area. A multi-stage
generative heuristic-enhanced prompt framework is proposed in this study to
enhance the ability of LLMs to recognize tenors, vehicles, and grounds in
Chinese metaphors. In the first stage, a small model is trained to obtain the
required confidence score for answer candidate generation. In the second stage,
questions are clustered and sampled according to specific rules. Finally, the
heuristic-enhanced prompt needed is formed by combining the generated answer
candidates and demonstrations. The proposed model achieved 3rd place in Track 1
of Subtask 1, 1st place in Track 2 of Subtask 1, and 1st place in both tracks
of Subtask 2 at the NLPCC-2024 Shared Task 9.

Context propagation remains a central challenge in language model
architectures, particularly in tasks requiring the retention of long-range
dependencies. Conventional attention mechanisms, while effective in many
applications, exhibit limitations in maintaining coherent contextual
representations over extended sequences due to their reliance on discrete token
interactions. A novel approach is introduced through the formulation of
Intrinsic Tensor Field Propagation (ITFP), which models contextual
relationships as continuous tensor fields distributed across token embeddings.
The propagation dynamics are governed through differential equations that
enable a structured flow of contextual information, augmenting the standard
attention mechanism to enhance coherence and recall. A series of experiments
conducted on an open-source transformer-based model demonstrate that ITFP
provides measurable improvements in contextual retention, dependency
resolution, and inference stability across various linguistic structures.
Comparisons with baseline models reveal a reduction in syntactic
inconsistencies and factual errors, while ablation studies indicate that the
choice of propagation depth and integration strength significantly impacts
model performance. Additional evaluations assessing domain generalization
suggest that ITFP effectively adapts across different text genres, reinforcing
its applicability beyond conventional language modeling tasks. Although
computational trade-offs are introduced through the inclusion of tensor field
computations, empirical findings suggest that the benefits in accuracy and
coherence outweigh the increased processing demands.

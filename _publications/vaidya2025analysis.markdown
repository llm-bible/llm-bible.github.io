This report evaluates the performance of text-in text-out Large Language
Models (LLMs) to understand and generate Indic languages. This evaluation is
used to identify and prioritize Indic languages suited for inclusion in safety
benchmarks. We conduct this study by reviewing existing evaluation studies and
datasets; and a set of twenty-eight LLMs that support Indic languages. We
analyze the LLMs on the basis of the training data, license for model and data,
type of access and model developers. We also compare Indic language performance
across evaluation datasets and find that significant performance disparities in
performance across Indic languages. Hindi is the most widely represented
language in models. While model performance roughly correlates with number of
speakers for the top five languages, the assessment after that varies.

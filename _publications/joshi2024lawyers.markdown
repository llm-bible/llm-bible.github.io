Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate text
across various languages, for tasks such as translation, customer support, and
education. Despite these advancements, LLMs show notable gender biases in
English, which become even more pronounced when generating content in
relatively underrepresented languages like Hindi. This study explores implicit
gender biases in Hindi text generation and compares them to those in English.
We developed Hindi datasets inspired by WinoBias to examine stereotypical
patterns in responses from models like GPT-4o and Claude-3 sonnet. Our results
reveal a significant gender bias of 87.8% in Hindi, compared to 33.4% in
English GPT-4o generation, with Hindi responses frequently relying on gender
stereotypes related to occupations, power hierarchies, and social class. This
research underscores the variation in gender biases across languages and
provides considerations for navigating these biases in generative AI systems.

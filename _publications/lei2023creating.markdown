In this study we present a novel dataset for training machine learning models translating between OpenMP Fortran and C++ code. To ensure reliability and applicability the dataset is created from a range of representative open45;source OpenMP benchmarks. It is also refined using a meticulous code similarity test. The effectiveness of our dataset is assessed using both quantitative (CodeBLEU) and qualitative (human evaluation) methods. We showcase how this dataset significantly elevates the translation competencies of large language models (LLMs). Specifically models without prior coding knowledge experienced a boost of mathbf123;×~5.1125; in their CodeBLEU scores while models with some coding familiarity saw an impressive mathbf123;×~9.9125;45;fold increase. The best fine45;tuned model using our dataset outperforms GPT45;4. It is also reaching human45;level accuracy. This work underscores the immense potential of our dataset in propelling advancements in the domain of code translation for high45;performance computing. The dataset is accessible at href123;https://github.com/bin123apple/Fortran&#45;CPP&#45;HPC&#45;code&#45;translation&#45;dataset&#125;&#123;OpenMP&#45;Fortran&#45;CPP&#45;Translation&#125;.

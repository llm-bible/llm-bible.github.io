The recent progression of Large Language Models (LLMs) has witnessed great success in the fields of data45;centric applications. LLMs trained on massive textual datasets showed ability to encode not only context but also ability to provide powerful comprehension to downstream tasks. Interestingly Generative Pre45;trained Transformers utilised this ability to bring AI a step closer to human being replacement in at least datacentric applications. Such power can be leveraged to identify anomalies of cyber threats enhance incident response and automate routine security operations. We provide an overview for the recent activities of LLMs in cyber defence sections as well as categorization for the cyber defence sections such as threat intelligence vulnerability assessment network security privacy preserving awareness and training automation and ethical guidelines. Fundamental concepts of the progression of LLMs from Transformers Pre45;trained Transformers and GPT is presented. Next the recent works of each section is surveyed with the related strengths and weaknesses. A special section about the challenges and directions of LLMs in cyber security is provided. Finally possible future research directions for benefiting from LLMs in cyber security is discussed.

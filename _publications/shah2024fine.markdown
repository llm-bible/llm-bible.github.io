Analyzing user reviews for sentiment towards app features can provide valuable insights into users perceptions of app functionality and their evolving needs. Given the volume of user reviews received daily an automated mechanism to generate feature45;level sentiment summaries of user reviews is needed. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have shown impressive performance on several new tasks without updating the models parameters i.e. using zero or a few labeled examples. Despite these advancements LLMs capabilities to perform feature45;specific sentiment analysis of user reviews remain unexplored. This study compares the performance of state45;of45;the45;art LLMs including GPT45;4 ChatGPT and LLama45;245;chat variants for extracting app features and associated sentiments under 045;shot 145;shot and 545;shot scenarios. Results indicate the best45;performing GPT45;4 model outperforms rule45;based approaches by 23.637; in f145;score with zero45;shot feature extraction; 545;shot further improving it by 637;. GPT45;4 achieves a 7437; f145;score for predicting positive sentiment towards correctly predicted app features with 545;shot enhancing it by 737;. Our study suggests that LLM models are promising for generating feature45;specific sentiment summaries of user reviews.

Automatic generation of graphical layouts is crucial for many real-world
applications, including designing posters, flyers, advertisements, and
graphical user interfaces. Given the incredible ability of Large language
models (LLMs) in both natural language understanding and generation, we believe
that we could customize an LLM to help people create compelling graphical
layouts starting with only text instructions from the user. We call our method
TextLap (text-based layout planning). It uses a curated instruction-based
layout planning dataset (InsLap) to customize LLMs as a graphic designer. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TextLap and show that it outperforms strong
baselines, including GPT-4 based methods, for image generation and graphical
design benchmarks.

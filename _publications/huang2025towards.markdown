Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to the
emergence of agentic AI systems that extend beyond the capabilities of
standalone models. By empowering LLMs to perceive external environments,
integrate multimodal information, and interact with various tools, these
agentic systems exhibit greater autonomy and adaptability across complex tasks.
This evolution brings new opportunities to recommender systems (RS): LLM-based
Agentic RS (LLM-ARS) can offer more interactive, context-aware, and proactive
recommendations, potentially reshaping the user experience and broadening the
application scope of RS. Despite promising early results, fundamental
challenges remain, including how to effectively incorporate external knowledge,
balance autonomy with controllability, and evaluate performance in dynamic,
multimodal settings. In this perspective paper, we first present a systematic
analysis of LLM-ARS: (1) clarifying core concepts and architectures; (2)
highlighting how agentic capabilities -- such as planning, memory, and
multimodal reasoning -- can enhance recommendation quality; and (3) outlining
key research questions in areas such as safety, efficiency, and lifelong
personalization. We also discuss open problems and future directions, arguing
that LLM-ARS will drive the next wave of RS innovation. Ultimately, we foresee
a paradigm shift toward intelligent, autonomous, and collaborative
recommendation experiences that more closely align with users' evolving needs
and complex decision-making processes.

The advent of ChatGPT and similar large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the human45;AI interaction and information45;seeking process. Leveraging LLMs as an alternative to search engines users can now access summarized information tailored to their queries significantly reducing the cognitive load associated with navigating vast information resources. This shift underscores the potential of LLMs in redefining information access paradigms. Drawing on the foundation of task45;focused information retrieval and LLMs task planning ability this research extends the scope of LLM capabilities beyond routine task automation to support users in navigating long45;term and significant life tasks. It introduces the GOLF framework (Goal45;Oriented Long45;term liFe tasks) which focuses on enhancing LLMs ability to assist in significant life decisions through goal orientation and long45;term planning. The methodology encompasses a comprehensive simulation study to test the frameworks efficacy followed by model and human evaluations to develop a dataset benchmark for long45;term life tasks and experiments across different models and settings. By shifting the focus from short45;term tasks to the broader spectrum of long45;term life goals this research underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in enhancing human decision45;making processes and task management marking a significant step forward in the evolution of human45;AI collaboration.

The idea of personality in descriptive psychology traditionally defined through observable behavior has now been extended to Large Language Models (LLMs) to better understand their behavior. This raises a question do LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality traits similar to humans Existing self-assessment personality tests while applicable lack the necessary validity and reliability for precise personality measurements. To address this we introduce TRAIT a new tool consisting of 8K multi-choice questions designed to assess the personality of LLMs with validity and reliability. TRAIT is built on the psychometrically validated human questionnaire Big Five Inventory (BFI) and Short Dark Triad (SD-3) enhanced with the ATOMIC10X knowledge graph for testing personality in a variety of real scenarios. TRAIT overcomes the reliability and validity issues when measuring personality of LLM with self-assessment showing the highest scores across three metrics refusal rate prompt sensitivity and option order sensitivity. It reveals notable insights into personality of LLM 1) LLMs exhibit distinct and consistent personality which is highly influenced by their training data (i.e. data used for alignment tuning) and 2) current prompting techniques have limited effectiveness in eliciting certain traits such as high psychopathy or low conscientiousness suggesting the need for further research in this direction.

Gender-neutral translation (GNT) that avoids biased and undue binary assumptions is a pivotal challenge for the creation of more inclusive translation technologies. Advancements for this task in Machine Translation (MT) however are hindered by the lack of dedicated parallel data which are necessary to adapt MT systems to satisfy neutral constraints. For such a scenario large language models offer hitherto unforeseen possibilities as they come with the distinct advantage of being versatile in various (sub)tasks when provided with explicit instructions. In this paper we explore this potential to automate GNT by comparing MT with the popular GPT-4 model. Through extensive manual analyses our study empirically reveals the inherent limitations of current MT systems in generating GNTs and provides valuable insights into the potential and challenges associated with prompting for neutrality.

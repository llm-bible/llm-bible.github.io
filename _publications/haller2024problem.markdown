Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have showcased their exceptional abilities across various tasks such as code generation problem45;solving and reasoning. Existing benchmarks evaluate tasks in isolation yet the extent to which LLMs can understand prose45;style tasks identify the underlying problems and then generate appropriate code solutions is still unexplored. Addressing this gap we introduce PECC a novel benchmark derived from Advent Of Code (AoC) challenges and Project Euler including 2396 problems. Unlike conventional benchmarks PECC requires LLMs to interpret narrative45;embedded problems extract requirements and generate executable code. A key feature of our dataset is the complexity added by natural language prompting in chat45;based evaluations mirroring real45;world instruction ambiguities. Results show varying model performance between narrative and neutral problems with specific challenges in the Euler math45;based subset with GPT45;3.545;Turbo passing 5037; of the AoC challenges and only 837; on the Euler problems. By probing the limits of LLMs capabilities our benchmark provides a framework to monitor and assess the subsequent progress of LLMs as a universal problem solver.

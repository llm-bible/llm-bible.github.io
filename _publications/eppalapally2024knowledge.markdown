Question-answering for domain-specific applications has recently attracted
much interest due to the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs).
However, accurately assessing the performance of these applications remains a
challenge, mainly due to the lack of suitable benchmarks that effectively
simulate real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we introduce two
product question-answering (QA) datasets focused on Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop
products to help evaluate the performance of existing models on domain-specific
product QA tasks. Additionally, we propose a novel knowledge-driven RAG-QA
framework to enhance the performance of the models in the product QA task. Our
experiments demonstrated that inducing domain knowledge through query
reformulation allowed for increased retrieval and generative performance when
compared to standard RAG-QA methods. This improvement, however, is slight, and
thus illustrates the challenge posed by the datasets introduced.

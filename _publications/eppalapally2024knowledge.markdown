Question-answering for domain-specific applications has recently attracted much interest due to the latest advancements in large language models (LLMs). However accurately assessing the performance of these applications remains a challenge mainly due to the lack of suitable benchmarks that effectively simulate real-world scenarios. To address this challenge we introduce two product question-answering (QA) datasets focused on Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop products to help evaluate the performance of existing models on domain-specific product QA tasks. Additionally we propose a novel knowledge-driven RAG-QA framework to enhance the performance of the models in the product QA task. Our experiments demonstrated that inducing domain knowledge through query reformulation allowed for increased retrieval and generative performance when compared to standard RAG-QA methods. This improvement however is slight and thus illustrates the challenge posed by the datasets introduced.

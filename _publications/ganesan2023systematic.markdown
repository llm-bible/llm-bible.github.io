Very large language models (LLMs) perform extremely well on a spectrum of NLP tasks in a zero45;shot setting. However little is known about their performance on human45;level NLP problems which rely on understanding psychological concepts such as assessing personality traits. In this work we investigate the zero45;shot ability of GPT45;3 to estimate the Big 5 personality traits from users social media posts. Through a set of systematic experiments we find that zero45;shot GPT45;3 performance is somewhat close to an existing pre45;trained SotA for broad classification upon injecting knowledge about the trait in the prompts. However when prompted to provide fine45;grained classification its performance drops to close to a simple most frequent class (MFC) baseline. We further analyze where GPT45;3 performs better as well as worse than a pretrained lexical model illustrating systematic errors that suggest ways to improve LLMs on human45;level NLP tasks.

Humans continuously make new discoveries, and understanding temporal sequence
of events leading to these breakthroughs is essential for advancing science and
society. This ability to reason over time allows us to identify future steps
and understand the effects of financial and political decisions on our lives.
However, large language models (LLMs) are typically trained on static datasets,
limiting their ability to perform effective temporal reasoning. To assess the
temporal reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we present the TRANSIENTTABLES
dataset, which comprises 3,971 questions derived from over 14,000 tables,
spanning 1,238 entities across multiple time periods. We introduce a
template-based question-generation pipeline that harnesses LLMs to refine both
templates and questions. Additionally, we establish baseline results using
state-of-the-art LLMs to create a benchmark. We also introduce novel modeling
strategies centered around task decomposition, enhancing LLM performance.

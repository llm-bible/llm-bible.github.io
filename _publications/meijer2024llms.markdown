Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly pivotal in various
domains due the recent advancements in their performance capabilities. However,
concerns persist regarding biases in LLMs, including gender, racial, and
cultural biases derived from their training data. These biases raise critical
questions about the ethical deployment and societal impact of LLMs.
Acknowledging these concerns, this study investigates whether LLMs accurately
reflect cross-cultural variations and similarities in moral perspectives. In
assessing whether the chosen LLMs capture patterns of divergence and agreement
on moral topics across cultures, three main methods are employed: (1)
comparison of model-generated and survey-based moral score variances, (2)
cluster alignment analysis to evaluate the correspondence between country
clusters derived from model-generated moral scores and those derived from
survey data, and (3) probing LLMs with direct comparative prompts. All three
methods involve the use of systematic prompts and token pairs designed to
assess how well LLMs understand and reflect cultural variations in moral
attitudes. The findings of this study indicate overall variable and low
performance in reflecting cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral
values across the models tested, highlighting the necessity for improving
models' accuracy in capturing these nuances effectively. The insights gained
from this study aim to inform discussions on the ethical development and
deployment of LLMs in global contexts, emphasizing the importance of mitigating
biases and promoting fair representation across diverse cultural perspectives.

Software repositories contain valuable information for gaining insights into
their development process. However, extracting insights from these repository
data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software
engineering chatbots have been developed to facilitate natural language
interactions with repositories, they struggle with understanding natural
language and accurately retrieving relevant data. This study aims to improve
the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by
augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We achieve this in a two-step approach;
(1) constructing a knowledge graph from the repository data and (2) synergizing
the knowledge graph with LLM to allow for the natural language questions and
answers. We curated a set of 20 questions with different complexities and
evaluated our approach on five popular open-source projects. Our approach
achieved an accuracy of 65%. We further investigated the limitations and
identified six key issues, with the majority relating to the reasoning
capability of the LLM. We experimented with a few-shot chain-of-thought
prompting to determine if it could enhance our approach. This technique
improved the overall accuracy to 84%. Our findings demonstrate the synergy
between LLMs and knowledge graphs as a viable solution for making repository
data accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

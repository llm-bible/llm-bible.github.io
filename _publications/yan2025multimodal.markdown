Scientific reasoning, the process through which humans apply logic, evidence,
and critical thinking to explore and interpret scientific phenomena, is
essential in advancing knowledge reasoning across diverse fields. However,
despite significant progress, current scientific reasoning models still
struggle with generalization across domains and often fall short of multimodal
perception. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate text,
images, and other modalities, present an exciting opportunity to overcome these
limitations and enhance scientific reasoning. Therefore, this position paper
argues that MLLMs can significantly advance scientific reasoning across
disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. First, we
propose a four-stage research roadmap of scientific reasoning capabilities, and
highlight the current state of MLLM applications in scientific reasoning,
noting their ability to integrate and reason over diverse data types. Second,
we summarize the key challenges that remain obstacles to achieving MLLM's full
potential. To address these challenges, we propose actionable insights and
suggestions for the future. Overall, our work offers a novel perspective on
MLLM integration with scientific reasoning, providing the LLM community with a
valuable vision for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).

Augmenting large language models (LLMs) to understand audio 45;45; including non45;speech sounds and non45;verbal speech 45;45; is critically important for diverse real45;world applications of LLMs. In this paper we propose Audio Flamingo a novel audio language model with 1) strong audio understanding abilities 2) the ability to quickly adapt to unseen tasks via in45;context learning and retrieval and 3) strong multi45;turn dialogue abilities. We introduce a series of training techniques architecture design and data strategies to enhance our model with these abilities. Extensive evaluations across various audio understanding tasks confirm the efficacy of our method setting new state45;of45;the45;art benchmarks. Our demo website is https://audioflamingo.github.io/ and the code is open45;sourced at https://github.com/NVIDIA/audio&#45;flamingo.

Recommender systems (RS) have become essential in filtering information and
personalizing content for users. RS techniques have traditionally relied on
modeling interactions between users and items as well as the features of
content using models specific to each task. The emergence of foundation models
(FMs), large scale models trained on vast amounts of data such as GPT, LLaMA
and CLIP, is reshaping the recommendation paradigm. This survey provides a
comprehensive overview of the Foundation Models for Recommender Systems
(FM4RecSys), covering their integration in three paradigms: (1) Feature-Based
augmentation of representations, (2) Generative recommendation approaches, and
(3) Agentic interactive systems. We first review the data foundations of RS,
from traditional explicit or implicit feedback to multimodal content sources.
We then introduce FMs and their capabilities for representation learning,
natural language understanding, and multi-modal reasoning in RS contexts. The
core of the survey discusses how FMs enhance RS under different paradigms.
Afterward, we examine FM applications in various recommendation tasks. Through
an analysis of recent research, we highlight key opportunities that have been
realized as well as challenges encountered. Finally, we outline open research
directions and technical challenges for next-generation FM4RecSys. This survey
not only reviews the state-of-the-art methods but also provides a critical
analysis of the trade-offs among the feature-based, the generative, and the
agentic paradigms, outlining key open issues and future research directions.

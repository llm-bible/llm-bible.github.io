Asking questions from natural language text has attracted increasing attention recently and several schemes have been proposed with promising results by asking the right question words and copy relevant words from the input to the question. However most state45;of45;the45;art methods focus on asking simple questions involving single45;hop relations. In this paper we propose a new task called multihop question generation that asks complex and semantically relevant questions by additionally discovering and modeling the multiple entities and their semantic relations given a collection of documents and the corresponding answer 1. To solve the problem we propose multi45;hop answer45;focused reasoning on the grounded answer45;centric entity graph to include different granularity levels of semantic information including the word45;level and document45;level semantics of the entities and their semantic relations. Through extensive experiments on the HOTPOTQA dataset we demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our proposed model that serves as a baseline to motivate future work.

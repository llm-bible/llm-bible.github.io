Asking questions from natural language text has attracted increasing
attention recently, and several schemes have been proposed with promising
results by asking the right question words and copy relevant words from the
input to the question. However, most state-of-the-art methods focus on asking
simple questions involving single-hop relations. In this paper, we propose a
new task called multihop question generation that asks complex and semantically
relevant questions by additionally discovering and modeling the multiple
entities and their semantic relations given a collection of documents and the
corresponding answer 1. To solve the problem, we propose multi-hop
answer-focused reasoning on the grounded answer-centric entity graph to include
different granularity levels of semantic information including the word-level
and document-level semantics of the entities and their semantic relations.
Through extensive experiments on the HOTPOTQA dataset, we demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of our proposed model that serves as a baseline
to motivate future work.

We demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) exhibit consistent value
orientations despite adopting diverse personas, revealing a persistent inertia
in their responses that remains stable across the variety of roles they are
prompted to assume. To systematically explore this phenomenon, we introduce the
role-play-at-scale methodology, which involves prompting LLMs with randomized,
diverse personas and analyzing the macroscopic trend of their responses. Unlike
previous works that simply feed these questions to LLMs as if testing human
subjects, our role-play-at-scale methodology diagnoses inherent tendencies in a
systematic and scalable manner by: (1) prompting the model to act in different
random personas and (2) asking the same question multiple times for each random
persona. This approach reveals consistent patterns in LLM responses across
diverse role-play scenarios, indicating deeply encoded inherent tendencies. Our
findings contribute to the discourse on value alignment in foundation models
and demonstrate the efficacy of role-play-at-scale as a diagnostic tool for
uncovering encoded biases in LLMs.

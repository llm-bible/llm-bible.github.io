With rapid development of neural networks deep45;learning has been extended to various natural language generation fields such as machine translation dialogue generation and even literature creation. In this paper we propose a theme45;aware language generation model for Chinese music lyrics which improves the theme45;connectivity and coherence of generated paragraphs greatly. A multi45;channel sequence45;to45;sequence (seq2seq) model encodes themes and previous sentences as global and local contextual information. Moreover attention mechanism is incorporated for sequence decoding enabling to fuse context into predicted next texts. To prepare appropriate train corpus LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is applied for theme extraction. Generated lyrics is grammatically correct and semantically coherent with selected themes which offers a valuable modelling method in other fields including multi45;turn chatbots long paragraph generation and etc.

When seeking information from unfamiliar documents users frequently pose questions that cannot be answered by the documents. While existing large language models (LLMs) identify these unanswerable questions they do not assist users in reformulating their questions thereby reducing their overall utility. We curate CouldAsk an evaluation benchmark composed of existing and new datasets for document45;grounded question answering specifically designed to study reformulating unanswerable questions. We evaluate state45;of45;the45;art open45;source and proprietary LLMs on CouldAsk. The results demonstrate the limited capabilities of these models in reformulating questions. Specifically GPT45;4 and Llama245;7B successfully reformulate questions only 2637; and 1237; of the time respectively. Error analysis shows that 6237; of the unsuccessful reformulations stem from the models merely rephrasing the questions or even generating identical questions. We publicly release the benchmark and the code to reproduce the experiments.

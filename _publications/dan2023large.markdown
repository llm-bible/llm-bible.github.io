EduChat (https://www.educhat.top/) is a large-scale language model (LLM)-based chatbot system in the education domain. Its goal is to support personalized fair and compassionate intelligent education serving teachers students and parents. Guided by theories from psychology and education it further strengthens educational functions such as open question answering essay assessment Socratic teaching and emotional support based on the existing basic LLMs. Particularly we learn domain-specific knowledge by pre-training on the educational corpus and stimulate various skills with tool use by fine-tuning on designed system prompts and instructions. Currently EduChat is available online as an open-source project with its code data and model parameters available on platforms (e.g. GitHub https://github.com/icalk-nlp/EduChat, Hugging Face https://huggingface.co/ecnu-icalk ). We also prepare a demonstration of its capabilities online (https://vimeo.com/851004454). This initiative aims to promote research and applications of LLMs for intelligent education.

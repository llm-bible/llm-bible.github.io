EduChat (https://www.educhat.top/) is a large-scale language model
(LLM)-based chatbot system in the education domain. Its goal is to support
personalized, fair, and compassionate intelligent education, serving teachers,
students, and parents. Guided by theories from psychology and education, it
further strengthens educational functions such as open question answering,
essay assessment, Socratic teaching, and emotional support based on the
existing basic LLMs. Particularly, we learn domain-specific knowledge by
pre-training on the educational corpus and stimulate various skills with tool
use by fine-tuning on designed system prompts and instructions. Currently,
EduChat is available online as an open-source project, with its code, data, and
model parameters available on platforms (e.g., GitHub
https://github.com/icalk-nlp/EduChat, Hugging Face
https://huggingface.co/ecnu-icalk ). We also prepare a demonstration of its
capabilities online (https://vimeo.com/851004454). This initiative aims to
promote research and applications of LLMs for intelligent education.

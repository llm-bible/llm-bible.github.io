Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results in a variety of
literary tasks, often using complex memorized details of narration and
fictional characters. In this work, we evaluate the ability of Llama-3 at
attributing utterances of direct-speech to their speaker in novels. The LLM
shows impressive results on a corpus of 28 novels, surpassing published results
with ChatGPT and encoder-based baselines by a large margin. We then validate
these results by assessing the impact of book memorization and annotation
contamination. We found that these types of memorization do not explain the
large performance gain, making Llama-3 the new state-of-the-art for quotation
attribution in English literature. We release publicly our code and data.

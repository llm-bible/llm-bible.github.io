Large Language Models (LLMs) offer numerous applications the full extent of which is not yet understood. This paper investigates if LLMs can be applied for editing structured and semi-structured documents with minimal effort. Using a qualitative research approach we conduct two case studies with ChatGPT and thoroughly analyze the results. Our experiments indicate that LLMs can effectively edit structured and semi-structured documents when provided with basic straightforward prompts. ChatGPT demonstrates a strong ability to recognize and process the structure of annotated documents. This suggests that explicitly structuring tasks and data in prompts might enhance an LLMs ability to understand and solve tasks. Furthermore the experiments also reveal impressive pattern matching skills in ChatGPT. This observation deserves further investigation as it may contribute to understanding the processes leading to hallucinations in LLMs.

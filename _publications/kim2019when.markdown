Document-level context has received lots of attention for compensating neural machine translation (NMT) of isolated sentences. However recent advances in document-level NMT focus on sophisticated integration of the context explaining its improvement with only a few selected examples or targeted test sets. We extensively quantify the causes of improvements by a document-level model in general test sets clarifying the limit of the usefulness of document-level context in NMT. We show that most of the improvements are not interpretable as utilizing the context. We also show that a minimal encoding is sufficient for the context modeling and very long context is not helpful for NMT.

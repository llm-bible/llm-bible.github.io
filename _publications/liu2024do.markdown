Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently displayed their extraordinary
capabilities in language understanding. However, how to comprehensively assess
the sentiment capabilities of LLMs continues to be a challenge. This paper
investigates the ability of LLMs to detect and react to sentiment in text
modal. As the integration of LLMs into diverse applications is on the rise, it
becomes highly critical to comprehend their sensitivity to emotional tone, as
it can influence the user experience and the efficacy of sentiment-driven
tasks. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of
several prominent LLMs in identifying and responding appropriately to
sentiments like positive, negative, and neutral emotions. The models' outputs
are analyzed across various sentiment benchmarks, and their responses are
compared with human evaluations. Our discoveries indicate that although LLMs
show a basic sensitivity to sentiment, there are substantial variations in
their accuracy and consistency, emphasizing the requirement for further
enhancements in their training processes to better capture subtle emotional
cues. Take an example in our findings, in some cases, the models might wrongly
classify a strongly positive sentiment as neutral, or fail to recognize sarcasm
or irony in the text. Such misclassifications highlight the complexity of
sentiment analysis and the areas where the models need to be refined. Another
aspect is that different LLMs might perform differently on the same set of
data, depending on their architecture and training datasets. This variance
calls for a more in-depth study of the factors that contribute to the
performance differences and how they can be optimized.

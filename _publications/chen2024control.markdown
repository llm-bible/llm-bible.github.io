The Directed Acyclic Transformer is a fast non45;autoregressive (NAR) model that performs well in Neural Machine Translation. Two issues prevent its application to general Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks frequent Out45;Of45;Vocabulary (OOV) errors and the inability to faithfully generate entity names. We introduce Control45;DAG a constrained decoding algorithm for our Directed Acyclic T5 (DA45;T5) model which offers lexical vocabulary and length control. We show that Control45;DAG significantly enhances DA45;T5 on the Schema Guided Dialogue and the DART datasets establishing strong NAR results for Task45;Oriented Dialogue and Data45;to45;Text NLG.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly recognized for their
exceptional generative capabilities and versatility across various tasks.
However, the high inference costs associated with these models have not
received adequate attention, particularly when compared to the focus on
training costs in existing research. In response to this gap, our study
conducts a comprehensive benchmarking of LLM inference energy across a wide
range of NLP tasks, where we analyze the impact of different models, tasks,
prompts, and system-related factors on inference energy. Specifically, our
experiments reveal several interesting insights, including strong correlation
of inference energy with output token length and response time. Also, we find
that quantization and optimal batch sizes, along with targeted prompt phrases,
can significantly reduce energy usage. This study is the first to thoroughly
benchmark LLM inference across such a diverse range of aspects, providing
insights and offering several recommendations for improving energy efficiency
in model deployment.

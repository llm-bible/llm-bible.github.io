Inquisitive questions -- open-ended curiosity-driven questions people ask as they read -- are an integral part of discourse processing (Kehler and Rohde 2017; Onea 2016) and comprehension (Prince 2004). Recent work in NLP has taken advantage of question generation capabilities of LLMs to enhance a wide range of applications. But the space of inquisitive questions is vast many questions can be evoked from a given context. So which of those should be prioritized to find answers Linguistic theories unfortunately have not yet provided an answer to this question. This paper presents QSALIENCE a salience predictor of inquisitive questions. QSALIENCE is instruction-tuned over our dataset of linguist-annotated salience scores of 1766 (context question) pairs. A question scores high on salience if answering it would greatly enhance the understanding of the text (Van Rooy 2003). We show that highly salient questions are empirically more likely to be answered in the same article bridging potential questions (Onea 2016) with Questions Under Discussion (Roberts 2012). We further validate our findings by showing that answering salient questions is an indicator of summarization quality in news.

In the realm of mental health support chatbots, it is vital to show empathy
and encourage self-exploration to provide tailored solutions. However, current
approaches tend to provide general insights or solutions without fully
understanding the help-seeker's situation. Therefore, we propose PsyMix, a
chatbot that integrates the analyses of the seeker's state from the perspective
of a psychotherapy approach (Chain-of-Psychotherapies, CoP) before generating
the response, and learns to incorporate the strength of various psychotherapies
by fine-tuning on a mixture of CoPs. Through comprehensive evaluation, we found
that PsyMix can outperform the ChatGPT baseline, and demonstrate a comparable
level of empathy in its responses to that of human counselors.

End45;user development allows everyday users to tailor service robots or applications to their needs. One user45;friendly approach is natural language programming. However it encounters challenges such as an expansive user expression space and limited support for debugging and editing which restrict its application in end45;user programming. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers promising avenues for the translation and interpretation between human language instructions and the code executed by robots but their application in end45;user programming systems requires further study. We introduce Cocobo a natural language programming system with interactive diagrams powered by LLMs. Cocobo employs LLMs to understand users authoring intentions generate and explain robot programs and facilitate the conversion between executable code and flowchart representations. Our user study shows that Cocobo has a low learning curve enabling even users with zero coding experience to customize robot programs successfully.

Digital media platforms (e.g., social media, science blogs) offer
opportunities to communicate scientific content to general audiences at scale.
However, these audiences vary in their scientific expertise, literacy levels,
and personal backgrounds, making effective science communication challenging.
To address this challenge, we designed TranSlider, an AI-powered tool that
generates personalized translations of scientific text based on individual user
profiles (e.g., hobbies, location, and education). Our tool features an
interactive slider that allows users to steer the degree of personalization
from 0 (weakly relatable) to 100 (strongly relatable), leveraging LLMs to
generate the translations with given degrees. Through an exploratory study with
15 participants, we investigated both the utility of these AI-personalized
translations and how interactive reading features influenced users'
understanding and reading experiences. We found that participants who preferred
higher degrees of personalization appreciated the relatable and contextual
translations, while those who preferred lower degrees valued concise
translations with subtle contextualization. Furthermore, participants reported
the compounding effect of multiple translations on their understanding of
scientific content. Given these findings, we discuss several implications of
AI-personalized translation tools in facilitating communication in
collaborative contexts.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending and analyzing lengthy sequential inputs owing to their extensive context windows that allow processing millions of tokens in a single forward pass. However this paper uncovers a surprising limitation LLMs fall short when handling long input sequences. We investigate this issue using three datasets and two tasks (sentiment analysis and news categorization) across various LLMs including Claude 3 Gemini Pro GPT 3.5 Turbo Llama 3 Instruct and Mistral Instruct models. To address this limitation we propose and evaluate ad-hoc solutions that substantially enhance LLMs performance on long input sequences by up to 50 while reducing API cost and latency by up to 93 and 50 respectively.

The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for program code generation has gained substantial attention but their biases and limitations with non45;English prompts challenge global inclusivity. This paper investigates the complexities of multilingual prompt45;based code generation. Our evaluations of LLMs including CodeLLaMa and CodeGemma reveal significant disparities in code quality for non45;English prompts; we also demonstrate the inadequacy of simple approaches like prompt translation bootstrapped data augmentation and fine45;tuning. To address this we propose a zero45;shot cross45;lingual approach using a neural projection technique integrating a cross45;lingual encoder like LASER artetxe2019massively to map multilingual embeddings from it into the LLMs token space. This method requires training only on English data and scales effectively to other languages. Results on a translated and quality45;checked MBPP dataset show substantial improvements in code quality. This research promotes a more inclusive code generation landscape by empowering LLMs with multilingual capabilities to support the diverse linguistic spectrum in programming.

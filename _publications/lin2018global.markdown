In neural abstractive summarization the conventional sequence45;to45;sequence (seq2seq) model often suffers from repetition and semantic irrelevance. To tackle the problem we propose a global encoding framework which controls the information flow from the encoder to the decoder based on the global information of the source context. It consists of a convolutional gated unit to perform global encoding to improve the representations of the source45;side information. Evaluations on the LCSTS and the English Gigaword both demonstrate that our model outperforms the baseline models and the analysis shows that our model is capable of reducing repetition.

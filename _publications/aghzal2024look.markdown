Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across a wide variety of tasks. However they still face challenges with long-horizon planning. To study this we propose path planning tasks as a platform to evaluate LLMs ability to navigate long trajectories under geometric constraints. Our proposed benchmark systematically tests path-planning skills in complex settings. Using this we examined GPT-4s planning abilities using various task representations and prompting approaches. We found that framing prompts as Python code and decomposing long trajectory tasks improve GPT-4s path planning effectiveness. However while these approaches show some promise toward improving the planning ability of the model they do not obtain optimal paths and fail at generalizing over extended horizons.

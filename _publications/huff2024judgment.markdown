Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mimic human cognition in various
language-based tasks. However, their capacity for metacognition - particularly
in predicting memory performance - remains unexplored. Here, we introduce a
cross-agent prediction model to assess whether ChatGPT-based LLMs align with
human judgments of learning (JOL), a metacognitive measure where individuals
predict their own future memory performance. We tested humans and LLMs on pairs
of sentences, one of which was a garden-path sentence - a sentence that
initially misleads the reader toward an incorrect interpretation before
requiring reanalysis. By manipulating contextual fit (fitting vs. unfitting
sentences), we probed how intrinsic cues (i.e., relatedness) affect both LLM
and human JOL. Our results revealed that while human JOL reliably predicted
actual memory performance, none of the tested LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4-turbo,
and GPT-4o) demonstrated comparable predictive accuracy. This discrepancy
emerged regardless of whether sentences appeared in fitting or unfitting
contexts. These findings indicate that, despite LLMs' demonstrated capacity to
model human cognition at the object-level, they struggle at the meta-level,
failing to capture the variability in individual memory predictions. By
identifying this shortcoming, our study underscores the need for further
refinements in LLMs' self-monitoring abilities, which could enhance their
utility in educational settings, personalized learning, and human-AI
interactions. Strengthening LLMs' metacognitive performance may reduce the
reliance on human oversight, paving the way for more autonomous and seamless
integration of AI into tasks requiring deeper cognitive awareness.

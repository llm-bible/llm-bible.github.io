In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive SWOT analysis of prompt engineering
techniques within the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). Emphasizing
linguistic principles, we examine various techniques to identify their
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our findings provide
insights into enhancing AI interactions and improving language model
comprehension of human prompts. The analysis covers techniques including
template-based approaches and fine-tuning, addressing the problems and
challenges associated with each. The conclusion offers future research
directions aimed at advancing the effectiveness of prompt engineering in
optimizing human-machine communication.

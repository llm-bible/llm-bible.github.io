Molecule design is a multifaceted approach that leverages computational methods and experiments to optimize molecular properties fast-tracking new drug discoveries innovative material development and more efficient chemical processes. Recently text-based molecule design has emerged inspired by next-generation AI tasks analogous to foundational vision-language models. Our study explores the use of knowledge-augmented prompting of large language models (LLMs) for the zero-shot text-conditional de novo molecular generation task. Our approach uses task-specific instructions and a few demonstrations to address distributional shift challenges when constructing augmented prompts for querying LLMs to generate molecules consistent with technical descriptions. Our framework proves effective outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline models on benchmark datasets.

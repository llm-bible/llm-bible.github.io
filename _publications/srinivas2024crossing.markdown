Molecule design is a multifaceted approach that leverages computational methods and experiments to optimize molecular properties fast45;tracking new drug discoveries innovative material development and more efficient chemical processes. Recently text45;based molecule design has emerged inspired by next45;generation AI tasks analogous to foundational vision45;language models. Our study explores the use of knowledge45;augmented prompting of large language models (LLMs) for the zero45;shot text45;conditional de novo molecular generation task. Our approach uses task45;specific instructions and a few demonstrations to address distributional shift challenges when constructing augmented prompts for querying LLMs to generate molecules consistent with technical descriptions. Our framework proves effective outperforming state45;of45;the45;art (SOTA) baseline models on benchmark datasets.

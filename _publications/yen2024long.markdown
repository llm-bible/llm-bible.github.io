Extending large language models (LLMs) to process longer inputs is crucial for a wide range of applications. However the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE) a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient generalizable and versatile trained with 8K-token documents it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.

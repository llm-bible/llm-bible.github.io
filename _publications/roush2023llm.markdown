Recent advancements in text45;to45;image generation have revolutionized numerous fields including art and cinema by automating the generation of high45;quality context45;aware images and video. However the utility of these technologies is often limited by the inadequacy of text prompts in guiding the generator to produce artistically coherent and subject45;relevant images. In this paper We describe the techniques that can be used to make Large Language Models (LLMs) act as Art Directors that enhance image and video generation. We describe our unified system for this called LaDi. We explore how LaDi integrates multiple techniques for augmenting the capabilities of text45;to45;image generators (T2Is) and text45;to45;video generators (T2Vs) with a focus on constrained decoding intelligent prompting fine45;tuning and retrieval. LaDi and these techniques are being used today in apps and platforms developed by Plai Labs.

The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced various fields including natural language processing and automated dialogue systems. This paper explores the application of LLMs in psychological counseling addressing the increasing demand for mental health services. We present a method for instruction tuning LLMs with specialized prompts to enhance their performance in providing empathetic relevant and supportive responses. Our approach involves developing a comprehensive dataset of counseling-specific prompts refining them through feedback from professional counselors and conducting rigorous evaluations using both automatic metrics and human assessments. The results demonstrate that our instruction-tuned model outperforms several baseline LLMs highlighting its potential as a scalable and accessible tool for mental health support.

We present DSDrive, a streamlined end-to-end paradigm tailored for
integrating the reasoning and planning of autonomous vehicles into a unified
framework. DSDrive leverages a compact LLM that employs a distillation method
to preserve the enhanced reasoning capabilities of a larger-sized vision
language model (VLM). To effectively align the reasoning and planning tasks, a
waypoint-driven dual-head coordination module is further developed, which
synchronizes dataset structures, optimization objectives, and the learning
process. By integrating these tasks into a unified framework, DSDrive anchors
on the planning results while incorporating detailed reasoning insights,
thereby enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the end-to-end
pipeline. DSDrive has been thoroughly tested in closed-loop simulations, where
it performs on par with benchmark models and even outperforms in many key
metrics, all while being more compact in size. Additionally, the computational
efficiency of DSDrive (as reflected in its time and memory requirements during
inference) has been significantly enhanced. Evidently thus, this work brings
promising aspects and underscores the potential of lightweight systems in
delivering interpretable and efficient solutions for AD.

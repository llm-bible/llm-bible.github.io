Information-Seeking Dialogue (ISD) agents aim to provide accurate responses
to user queries. While proficient in directly addressing user queries, these
agents, as well as LLMs in general, predominantly exhibit reactive behavior,
lacking the ability to generate proactive responses that actively engage users
in sustained conversations. However, existing definitions of proactive dialogue
in this context do not focus on how each response actively engages the user and
sustains the conversation. Hence, we present a new definition of proactivity
that focuses on enhancing the `proactiveness' of each generated response via
the introduction of new information related to the initial query. To this end,
we construct a proactive dialogue dataset comprising 2,000 single-turn
conversations, and introduce several automatic metrics to evaluate response
`proactiveness' which achieved high correlation with human annotation.
Additionally, we introduce two innovative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts, the
3-step CoT and the 3-in-1 CoT prompts, which consistently outperform standard
prompts by up to 90% in the zero-shot setting.

Multi45;modal language45;vision models trained on hundreds of millions of image45;text pairs (e.g. CLIP DALL45;E) gained a recent surge showing remarkable capability to perform zero45; or few45;shot learning and transfer even in absence of per45;sample labels on target image data. Despite this trend to date there has been no publicly available datasets of sufficient scale for training such models from scratch. To address this issue in a community effort we build and release for public LAION45;400M a dataset with CLIP45;filtered 400 million image45;text pairs their CLIP embeddings and kNN indices that allow efficient similarity search.

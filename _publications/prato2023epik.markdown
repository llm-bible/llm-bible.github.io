In the age of artificial intelligence the role of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly central. Despite their growing prevalence their capacity to consolidate knowledge from different training documents - a crucial ability in numerous applications - remains unexplored. This paper presents the first study examining the capability of LLMs to effectively combine such information within their parameter space. We introduce EpiK-Eval a novel question-answering benchmark tailored to evaluate LLMs proficiency in formulating a coherent and consistent knowledge representation from segmented narratives. Evaluations across various LLMs reveal significant weaknesses in this domain. We contend that these shortcomings stem from the intrinsic nature of prevailing training objectives. Consequently we advocate for refining the approach towards knowledge consolidation as it harbors the potential to dramatically improve their overall effectiveness and performance. The findings from this study offer insights for developing more robust and reliable LLMs. Our code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/chandar-lab/EpiK-Eval"

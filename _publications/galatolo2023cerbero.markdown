This study introduces a novel approach for generating high45;quality language45;specific chat corpora using a self45;chat mechanism. We combine a generator LLM for creating new samples and an embedder LLM to ensure diversity. A new Masked Language Modelling (MLM) model45;based quality assessment metric is proposed for evaluating and filtering the corpora. Utilizing the llama245;70b as the generator and a multilingual sentence transformer as embedder we generate an Italian chat corpus and refine the Fauno corpus which is based on translated English ChatGPT self45;chat data. The refinement uses structural assertions and Natural Language Processing techniques. Both corpora undergo a comprehensive quality evaluation using the proposed MLM model45;based quality metric. The Italian LLM fine45;tuned with these corpora demonstrates significantly enhanced language comprehension and question45;answering skills. The resultant model cerbero45;7b establishes a new state45;of45;the45;art for Italian LLMs. This approach marks a substantial advancement in the development of language45;specific LLMs with a special emphasis on augmenting corpora for underrepresented languages like Italian.

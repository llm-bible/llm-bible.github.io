Visual grounding focuses on establishing fine-grained alignment between
vision and natural language, which has essential applications in multimodal
reasoning systems. Existing methods use pre-trained query-agnostic visual
backbones to extract visual feature maps independently without considering the
query information. We argue that the visual features extracted from the visual
backbones and the features really needed for multimodal reasoning are
inconsistent. One reason is that there are differences between pre-training
tasks and visual grounding. Moreover, since the backbones are query-agnostic,
it is difficult to completely avoid the inconsistency issue by training the
visual backbone end-to-end in the visual grounding framework. In this paper, we
propose a Query-modulated Refinement Network (QRNet) to address the
inconsistent issue by adjusting intermediate features in the visual backbone
with a novel Query-aware Dynamic Attention (QD-ATT) mechanism and query-aware
multiscale fusion. The QD-ATT can dynamically compute query-dependent visual
attention at the spatial and channel levels of the feature maps produced by the
visual backbone. We apply the QRNet to an end-to-end visual grounding
framework. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on five widely used datasets.

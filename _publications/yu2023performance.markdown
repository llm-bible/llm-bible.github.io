Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited notable efficacy in question45;answering (QA) tasks across diverse domains. Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM45;based autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs transitioning to purpose45;driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi45;source information establish reasoning chains and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this we introduce textsc123;FinMem125; a novel LLM45;based agent framework devised for financial decision45;making. It encompasses three core modules Profiling to customize the agents characteristics; Memory with layered message processing to aid the agent in assimilating hierarchical financial data; and Decision45;making to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably textsc123;FinMem125;s memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders offering robust interpretability and real45;time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self45;evolve its professional knowledge react agilely to new investment cues and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare textsc123;FinMem125; with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real45;world financial dataset underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks. We then fine45;tuned the agents perceptual span and character setting to achieve a significantly enhanced trading performance. Collectively textsc123;FinMem125; presents a cutting45;edge LLM agent framework for automated trading boosting cumulative investment returns.

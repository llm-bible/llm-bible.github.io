In45;Context Learning (ICL) empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) with the capacity to learn in context achieving downstream generalization without gradient updates but with a few in45;context examples. Despite the encouraging empirical success the underlying mechanism of ICL remains unclear and existing research offers various viewpoints of understanding. These studies propose intuition45;driven and ad45;hoc technical solutions for interpreting ICL illustrating an ambiguous road map. In this paper we leverage a data generation perspective to reinterpret recent efforts and demonstrate the potential broader usage of popular technical solutions approaching a systematic angle. For a conceptual definition we rigorously adopt the terms of skill learning and skill recognition. The difference between them is skill learning can learn new data generation functions from in45;context data. We also provide a comprehensive study on the merits and weaknesses of different solutions and highlight the uniformity among them given the perspective of data generation establishing a technical foundation for future research to incorporate the strengths of different lines of research.

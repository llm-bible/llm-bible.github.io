With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), the focus in
Conversational AI has shifted from merely generating coherent and relevant
responses to tackling more complex challenges, such as personalizing dialogue
systems. In an effort to enhance user engagement, chatbots are often designed
to mimic human behaviour, responding within a defined emotional spectrum and
aligning to a set of values. In this paper, we aim to simulate personal traits
according to the Big Five model with the use of LLMs. Our research showed that
generating personality-related texts is still a challenging task for the
models. As a result, we present a dataset of generated texts with the
predefined Big Five characteristics and provide an analytical framework for
testing LLMs on a simulation of personality skills.

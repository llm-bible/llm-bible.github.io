Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various tasks but often fail to handle queries that exceed their knowledge and capabilities leading to incorrect or fabricated responses. This paper addresses the need for LLMs to recognize and refuse infeasible tasks due to the required skills surpassing their capabilities. We first systematically conceptualize infeasible tasks for LLMs providing formal definitions and categorizations that cover a spectrum of related hallucinations. We develop and benchmark a new dataset comprising diverse infeasible and feasible tasks to test multiple LLMs abilities on task feasibility. Furthermore we explore the potential of training enhancements to increase LLMs refusal capabilities with fine-tuning. Experiments validate the effectiveness of our methods offering promising directions for refining the operational boundaries of LLMs in real applications.

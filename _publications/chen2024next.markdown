Building on the foundations of language modeling in natural language
processing, Next Token Prediction (NTP) has evolved into a versatile training
objective for machine learning tasks across various modalities, achieving
considerable success. As Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced to unify
understanding and generation tasks within the textual modality, recent research
has shown that tasks from different modalities can also be effectively
encapsulated within the NTP framework, transforming the multimodal information
into tokens and predict the next one given the context. This survey introduces
a comprehensive taxonomy that unifies both understanding and generation within
multimodal learning through the lens of NTP. The proposed taxonomy covers five
key aspects: Multimodal tokenization, MMNTP model architectures, unified task
representation, datasets \& evaluation, and open challenges. This new taxonomy
aims to aid researchers in their exploration of multimodal intelligence. An

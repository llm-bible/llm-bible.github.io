Based on recent advances in realistic language modeling (GPT45;3) and cross45;modal representations (CLIP) Gaudi was developed to help designers search for inspirational images using natural language. In the early stages of the design process with the goal of eliciting a clients preferred creative direction designers will typically create thematic collections of inspirational images called mood45;boards. Creating a mood45;board involves sequential image searches which are currently performed using keywords or images. Gaudi transforms this process into a conversation where the user is gradually detailing the mood45;boards theme. This representation allows our AI to generate new search queries from scratch straight from a project briefing following a theme hypothesized by GPT45;3. Compared to previous computational approaches to mood45;board creation to the best of our knowledge ours is the first attempt to represent mood45;boards as the stories that designers tell when presenting a creative direction to a client.

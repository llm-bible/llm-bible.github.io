Mental manipulation severely undermines mental wellness by covertly and
negatively distorting decision-making. While there is an increasing interest in
mental health care within the natural language processing community, progress
in tackling manipulation remains limited due to the complexity of detecting
subtle, covert tactics in conversations. In this paper, we propose Intent-Aware
Prompting (IAP), a novel approach for detecting mental manipulations using
large language models (LLMs), providing a deeper understanding of manipulative
tactics by capturing the underlying intents of participants. Experimental
results on the MentalManip dataset demonstrate superior effectiveness of IAP
against other advanced prompting strategies. Notably, our approach
substantially reduces false negatives, helping detect more instances of mental
manipulation with minimal misjudgment of positive cases. The code of this paper
is available at https://github.com/Anton-Jiayuan-MA/Manip-IAP.

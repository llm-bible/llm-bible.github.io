Persuasion techniques detection in news in a multi45;lingual setup is non45;trivial and comes with challenges including little training data. Our system successfully leverages (back45;)translation as data augmentation strategies with multi45;lingual transformer models for the task of detecting persuasion techniques. The automatic and human evaluation of our augmented data allows us to explore whether (back45;)translation aid or hinder performance. Our in45;depth analyses indicate that both data augmentation strategies boost performance; however balancing human45;produced and machine45;generated data seems to be crucial.

Persuasion techniques detection in news in a multi-lingual setup is non-trivial and comes with challenges including little training data. Our system successfully leverages (back-)translation as data augmentation strategies with multi-lingual transformer models for the task of detecting persuasion techniques. The automatic and human evaluation of our augmented data allows us to explore whether (back-)translation aid or hinder performance. Our in-depth analyses indicate that both data augmentation strategies boost performance; however balancing human-produced and machine-generated data seems to be crucial.

Language style is often used by writers to convey their intentions identities and mastery of language. In this paper we show that current large language models struggle to capture some language styles without fine45;tuning. To address this challenge we investigate whether LLMs can be meta45;trained based on representative lexicons to recognize new styles they have not been fine45;tuned on. Experiments on 13 established style classification tasks as well as 63 novel tasks generated using LLMs demonstrate that meta45;training with style lexicons consistently improves zero45;shot transfer across styles. We release the code and data at http://github.com/octaviaguo/Style&#45;LLM .

GPT-4 was released in March 2023 to wide acclaim marking a very substantial improvement across the board over GPT-3.5 (OpenAIs previously best model which had powered the initial release of ChatGPT). However despite the genuinely impressive improvement there are good reasons to be highly skeptical of GPT-4s ability to reason. This position paper discusses the nature of reasoning; criticizes the current formulation of reasoning problems in the NLP community as well as the way in which LLM reasoning performance is currently evaluated; introduces a small collection of 21 diverse reasoning problems; and performs a detailed qualitative evaluation of GPT-4s performance on those problems. Based on this analysis the paper concludes that despite its occasional flashes of analytical brilliance GPT-4 at present is utterly incapable of reasoning.

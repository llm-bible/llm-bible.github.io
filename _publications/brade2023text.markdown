Text-to-image generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
generating high-quality images based on textual prompts. However, crafting
prompts that accurately capture the user's creative intent remains challenging.
It often involves laborious trial-and-error procedures to ensure that the model
interprets the prompts in alignment with the user's intention. To address the
challenges, we present Promptify, an interactive system that supports prompt
exploration and refinement for text-to-image generative models. Promptify
utilizes a suggestion engine powered by large language models to help users
quickly explore and craft diverse prompts. Our interface allows users to
organize the generated images flexibly, and based on their preferences,
Promptify suggests potential changes to the original prompt. This feedback loop
enables users to iteratively refine their prompts and enhance desired features
while avoiding unwanted ones. Our user study shows that Promptify effectively
facilitates the text-to-image workflow and outperforms an existing baseline
tool widely used for text-to-image generation.

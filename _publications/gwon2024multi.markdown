Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have been remarkable,
with new models consistently surpassing their predecessors. These advancements
are underpinned by extensive research on various training mechanisms. Among
these, Preference Optimization has played a significant role in improving the
performance of LLMs by incorporating human preferences into the training
process. However, constructing preference optimization datasets is challenging
and the optimization process is highly sensitive to the dataset quality. In
this study, we propose a novel approach to augment Preference Optimization
datasets. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-response-based Preference
Optimization training method that enables the simultaneous learning of multiple
responses.

Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) in Intelligent Tutoring Systems
(ITS) presents transformative opportunities for personalized education.
However, current implementations face two critical challenges: maintaining
factual accuracy and delivering coherent, context-aware instruction. While
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) partially addresses these issues, its
reliance on pure semantic similarity limits its effectiveness in educational
contexts where conceptual relationships are crucial. This paper introduces
Knowledge Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG), a novel
framework that integrates structured knowledge representation with
context-aware retrieval to enable more effective AI tutoring. We present three
key contributions: (1) a novel architecture that grounds AI responses in
structured domain knowledge, (2) empirical validation through controlled
experiments (n=76) demonstrating significant learning improvements (35%
increase in assessment scores, p<0.001), and (3) a comprehensive implementation
framework addressing practical deployment considerations. These results
establish KG-RAG as a robust solution for developing adaptable AI tutoring
systems across diverse educational contexts.

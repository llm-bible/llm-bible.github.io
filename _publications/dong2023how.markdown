This paper proposes a low45;code solution to build an AI tutor that leverages advanced AI techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses in a personalized learning environment. The OpenAI Assistants API allows AI Tutor to easily embed store retrieve and manage files and chat history enabling a low45;code solution. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval45;Augmented Generation (RAG) technology generate sophisticated answers based on course45;specific materials. The application efficiently organizes and retrieves relevant information through vector embedding and similarity45;based retrieval algorithms. The AI Tutor prototype demonstrates its ability to generate relevant accurate answers with source citations. It represents a significant advancement in technology45;enhanced tutoring systems democratizing access to high45;quality customized educational support in higher education.

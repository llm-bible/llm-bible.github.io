Despite the stunning ability to generate high45;quality images by recent text45;to45;image models current approaches often struggle to effectively compose objects with different attributes and relationships into a complex and coherent scene. We propose T2I45;CompBench a comprehensive benchmark for open45;world compositional text45;to45;image generation consisting of 6000 compositional text prompts from 3 categories (attribute binding object relationships and complex compositions) and 6 sub45;categories (color binding shape binding texture binding spatial relationships non45;spatial relationships and complex compositions). We further propose several evaluation metrics specifically designed to evaluate compositional text45;to45;image generation and explore the potential and limitations of multimodal LLMs for evaluation. We introduce a new approach Generative mOdel fine45;tuning with Reward45;driven Sample selection (GORS) to boost the compositional text45;to45;image generation abilities of pretrained text45;to45;image models. Extensive experiments and evaluations are conducted to benchmark previous methods on T2I45;CompBench and to validate the effectiveness of our proposed evaluation metrics and GORS approach.

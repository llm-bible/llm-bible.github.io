In recent years neural paraphrase generation based on Seq2Seq has achieved superior performance however the generated paraphrase still has the problem of lack of diversity. In this paper we focus on improving the diversity between the generated paraphrase and the original sentence i.e. making generated paraphrase different from the original sentence as much as possible. We propose BTmPG (Back45;Translation guided multi45;round Paraphrase Generation) which leverages multi45;round paraphrase generation to improve diversity and employs back45;translation to preserve semantic information. We evaluate BTmPG on two benchmark datasets. Both automatic and human evaluation show BTmPG can improve the diversity of paraphrase while preserving the semantics of the original sentence.

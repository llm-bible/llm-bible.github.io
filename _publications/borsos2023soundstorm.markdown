We present SoundStorm a model for efficient non-autoregressive audio generation. SoundStorm receives as input the semantic tokens of AudioLM and relies on bidirectional attention and confidence-based parallel decoding to generate the tokens of a neural audio codec. Compared to the autoregressive generation approach of AudioLM our model produces audio of the same quality and with higher consistency in voice and acoustic conditions while being two orders of magnitude faster. SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality natural dialogue segments given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers voices.

Supporting learners' understanding of taught skills in online settings is a
longstanding challenge. While exercises and chat-based agents can evaluate
understanding in limited contexts, this challenge is magnified when learners
seek explanations that delve into procedural knowledge (how things are done)
and reasoning (why things happen). We hypothesize that an intelligent agent's
ability to understand and explain learners' questions about skills can be
significantly enhanced using the TMK (Task-Method-Knowledge) model, a
Knowledge-based AI framework. We introduce Ivy, an intelligent agent that
leverages an LLM and iterative refinement techniques to generate explanations
that embody teleological, causal, and compositional principles. Our initial
evaluation demonstrates that this approach goes beyond the typical shallow
responses produced by an agent with access to unstructured text, thereby
substantially improving the depth and relevance of feedback. This can
potentially ensure learners develop a comprehensive understanding of skills
crucial for effective problem-solving in online environments.

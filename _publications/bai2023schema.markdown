In this paper we explore the question of whether large language models can support cost45;efficient information extraction from tables. We introduce schema45;driven information extraction a new task that transforms tabular data into structured records following a human45;authored schema. To assess various LLMs capabilities on this task we present a benchmark comprised of tables from four diverse domains machine learning papers chemistry literature material science journals and webpages. We use this collection of annotated tables to evaluate the ability of open45;source and API45;based language models to extract information from tables covering diverse domains and data formats. Our experiments demonstrate that surprisingly competitive performance can be achieved without requiring task45;specific pipelines or labels achieving F1 scores ranging from 74.2 to 96.1 while maintaining cost efficiency. Moreover through detailed ablation studies and analyses we investigate the factors contributing to model success and validate the practicality of distilling compact models to reduce API reliance.

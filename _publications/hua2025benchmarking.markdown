Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in transforming machine learning research, yet their capability to faithfully implement novel ideas from recent research papers-ideas unseen during pretraining-remains unclear. We introduce ResearchCodeBench, a benchmark of 212 coding challenges that evaluates LLMs' ability to translate cutting-edge ML contributions from top 2024-2025 research papers into executable code. We assessed 30+ proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that even the best models correctly implement less than 40% of the code. We find Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview to perform best at 37.3% success rate, with O3 (High) and O4-mini (High) following behind at 32.3% and 30.8% respectively. We present empirical findings on performance comparison, contamination, and error patterns. By providing a rigorous and community-driven evaluation platform, ResearchCodeBench enables continuous understanding and advancement of LLM-driven innovation in research code generation.

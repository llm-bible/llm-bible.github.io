ChatGPT GPT45;3.5 and other large language models (LLMs) have drawn significant attention since their release and the abilities of these models have been investigated for a wide variety of tasks. In this research we investigate to what extent GPT45;3.5 can generate human45;like comments on Dutch news articles. We define human likeness as not distinguishable from human comments approximated by the difficulty of automatic classification between human and GPT comments. We analyze human likeness across multiple prompting techniques. In particular we utilize zero45;shot few45;shot and context prompts for two generated personas. We found that our fine45;tuned BERT models can easily distinguish human45;written comments from GPT45;3.5 generated comments with none of the used prompting methods performing noticeably better. We further analyzed that human comments consistently showed higher lexical diversity than GPT45;generated comments. This indicates that although generative LLMs can generate fluent text their capability to create human45;like opinionated comments is still limited.

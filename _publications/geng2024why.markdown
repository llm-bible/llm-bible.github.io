The scarcity of non-English data limits the development of non-English large language models (LLMs). Transforming English-centric LLMs to non-English has been identified as an effective and resource-efficient method. Previous works start from base LLMs and perform knowledge distillation (KD) with data generated by stronger LLMs e.g. GPT-4. Compared to base LLMs chat LLMs are further optimized for advanced abilities e.g. multi-turn conversation and human preference alignment and thus more powerful in both helpfulness and safety. However transforming a chat LLM involves two critical issues (1) How can we effectively transfer advanced abilities without their supervised data (2) How can we prevent the original knowledge from catastrophic forgetting during transformation We target these issues by introducing a simple framework called TransLLM. For the first issue TransLLM divides the transfer problem into some common sub-tasks with the translation chain-of-thought which uses the translation as the bridge between English and non-English step-by-step. We further enhance the performance of sub-tasks with publicly available data. For the second issue we propose a method comprising two synergistic components low-rank adaptation for training to maintain the original LLM parameters and recovery KD which utilizes data generated by the chat LLM itself to recover the original knowledge from the frozen parameters. In the experiments we transform the LLaMA-2-chat-7B to the Thai language. Our method using only single-turn data outperforms strong baselines and ChatGPT on multi-turn benchmark MT-bench. Furthermore our method without safety data rejects more harmful queries of safety benchmark AdvBench than both ChatGPT and GPT-4.

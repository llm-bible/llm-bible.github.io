We perform a mixed-method frame semantics-based analysis on a dataset of more
than 49,000 sentences collected from 5846 news articles that mention AI. The
dataset covers the twelve-month period centred around the launch of OpenAI's
chatbot ChatGPT and is collected from the most visited open-access
English-language news publishers. Our findings indicate that during the six
months succeeding the launch, media attention rose tenfold\\(\unicode\{x2014\}\\)from
already historically high levels. During this period, discourse has become
increasingly centred around experts and political leaders, and AI has become
more closely associated with dangers and risks. A deeper review of the data
also suggests a qualitative shift in the types of threat AI is thought to
represent, as well as the anthropomorphic qualities ascribed to it.

Large language models (LLMs) have transformed many fields including natural language processing computer vision and reinforcement learning. These models have also made a significant impact in the field of law where they are being increasingly utilized to automate various legal tasks such as legal judgement prediction legal document analysis and legal document writing. However the integration of LLMs into the legal field has also raised several legal problems including privacy concerns bias and explainability. In this survey we explore the integration of LLMs into the field of law. We discuss the various applications of LLMs in legal tasks examine the legal challenges that arise from their use and explore the data resources that can be used to specialize LLMs in the legal domain. Finally we discuss several promising directions and conclude this paper. By doing so we hope to provide an overview of the current state of LLMs in law and highlight the potential benefits and challenges of their integration.

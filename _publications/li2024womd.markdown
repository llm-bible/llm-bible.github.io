We propose Waymo Open Motion Dataset45;Reasoning (WOMD45;Reasoning) a language annotation dataset built on WOMD with a focus on describing and reasoning interactions and intentions in driving scenarios. Previous language datasets primarily captured interactions caused by close distances. However interactions induced by traffic rules and human intentions which can occur over long distances are yet sufficiently covered despite being very common and more challenging for prediction or planning models to understand. Therefore our WOMD45;Reasoning focuses extensively on these interactions providing a total of 409k Qamp;As for varying types of interactions. Additionally WOMD45;Reasoning presents by far the largest Qamp;A dataset on real45;world driving scenarios with around 3 million Qamp;As covering various topics of autonomous driving from map descriptions motion status descriptions to narratives and analyses of agents interactions behaviors and intentions. This extensive textual information enables fine45;tuning driving45;related Large Language Models (LLMs) for a wide range of applications like scene description prediction planning etc. By incorporating interaction and intention language from WOMD45;Reasoning we see significant enhancements in the performance of the state45;of45;the45;art trajectory prediction model Multipath++ with improvements of 10.1437; in MR95;6 and 6.9037; in minFDE95;6 proving the effectiveness of WOMD45;Reasoning. We hope WOMD45;Reasoning would empower LLMs in driving to offer better interaction understanding and behavioral reasoning. The dataset is available on https://waymo.com/open/download .

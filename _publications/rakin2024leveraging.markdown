While ongoing advancements in Large Language Models have demonstrated
remarkable success across various NLP tasks, Retrieval Augmented Generation
Model stands out to be highly effective on downstream applications like
Question Answering. Recently, RAG-end2end model further optimized the
architecture and achieved notable performance improvements on domain
adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these RAG-based architectures remains
relatively unexplored when fine-tuned on specialized domains such as customer
service for building a reliable conversational AI system. Furthermore, a
critical challenge persists in reducing the occurrence of hallucinations while
maintaining high domain-specific accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the
performance of diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures through domain adaptation
and evaluated their ability to generate accurate and relevant response grounded
in the contextual knowledge base. To facilitate the evaluation of the models,
we constructed a novel dataset HotelConvQA, sourced from wide range of
hotel-related conversations and fine-tuned all the models on our domain
specific dataset. We also addressed a critical research gap on determining the
impact of domain adaptation on reducing hallucinations across different RAG
architectures, an aspect that was not properly measured in prior work. Our
evaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain
adaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights
into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations. Our findings clearly indicate
that domain adaptation not only enhances the models' performance on QA tasks
but also significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG
architectures.

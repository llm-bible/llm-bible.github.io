In this paper, we conducted a Multi-Perspective Comparative Narrative
Analysis (CNA) on three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and Llama2. We applied
identical prompts and evaluated their outputs on specific tasks, ensuring an
equitable and unbiased comparison between various LLMs. Our study revealed that
the three LLMs generated divergent responses to the same prompt, indicating
notable discrepancies in their ability to comprehend and analyze the given
task. Human evaluation was used as the gold standard, evaluating four
perspectives to analyze differences in LLM performance.

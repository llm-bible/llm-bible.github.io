The emergence of large language models (LLM) and, consequently, vision
language models (VLM) has ignited new imaginations among robotics researchers.
At this point, the range of applications to which LLM and VLM can be applied in
human-robot interaction (HRI), particularly socially assistive robots (SARs),
is unchartered territory. However, LLM and VLM present unprecedented
opportunities and challenges for SAR integration. We aim to illuminate the
opportunities and challenges when roboticists deploy LLM and VLM in SARs.
First, we conducted a meta-study of more than 250 papers exploring 1) major
robots in HRI research and 2) significant applications of SARs, emphasizing
education, healthcare, and entertainment while addressing 3) societal norms and
issues like trust, bias, and ethics that the robot developers must address.
Then, we identified 4) critical components of a robot that LLM or VLM can
replace while addressing the 5) benefits of integrating LLM into robot designs
and the 6) risks involved. Finally, we outline a pathway for the responsible
and effective adoption of LLM or VLM into SARs, and we close our discussion by
offering caution regarding this deployment.

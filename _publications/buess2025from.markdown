Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as diffusion models and
OpenAI's ChatGPT, are transforming medicine by enhancing diagnostic accuracy
and automating clinical workflows. The field has advanced rapidly, evolving
from text-only large language models for tasks such as clinical documentation
and decision support to multimodal AI systems capable of integrating diverse
data modalities, including imaging, text, and structured data, within a single
model. The diverse landscape of these technologies, along with rising interest,
highlights the need for a comprehensive review of their applications and
potential. This scoping review explores the evolution of multimodal AI,
highlighting its methods, applications, datasets, and evaluation in clinical
settings. Adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we systematically queried PubMed,
IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science, prioritizing recent studies published up to
the end of 2024. After rigorous screening, 144 papers were included, revealing
key trends and challenges in this dynamic field. Our findings underscore a
shift from unimodal to multimodal approaches, driving innovations in diagnostic
support, medical report generation, drug discovery, and conversational AI.
However, critical challenges remain, including the integration of heterogeneous
data types, improving model interpretability, addressing ethical concerns, and
validating AI systems in real-world clinical settings. This review summarizes
the current state of the art, identifies critical gaps, and provides insights
to guide the development of scalable, trustworthy, and clinically impactful
multimodal AI solutions in healthcare.

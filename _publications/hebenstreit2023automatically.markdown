Emergent chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities promise to improve performance and explainability of large language models (LLMs). However uncertainties remain about how reasoning strategies formulated for previous model generations generalize to new model generations and different datasets. In this small-scale study we compare different reasoning strategies induced by zero-shot prompting across six recently released LLMs (davinci-002 davinci-003 GPT-3.5-turbo GPT-4 Flan-T5-xxl and Cohere command-xlarge) on a mixture of six question-answering datasets including datasets from scientific and medical domains. Our findings demonstrate that while some variations in effectiveness occur gains from CoT reasoning strategies remain robust across different models and datasets. GPT-4 has the most benefit from current state-of-the-art reasoning strategies and exhibits the best performance by applying a prompt previously discovered through automated discovery.

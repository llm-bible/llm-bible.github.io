We present a state-of-the-art model for fine-grained probability estimation
of propositions conditioned on context. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their reasoning capabilities,
particularly on well-defined tasks with complete information. However, LLMs
continue to struggle with making accurate and well-calibrated probabilistic
predictions under uncertainty or partial information. While incorporating
uncertainty into model predictions often boosts performance, obtaining reliable
estimates of that uncertainty remains understudied. In particular, LLM
probability estimates tend to be coarse and biased towards more frequent
numbers. Through a combination of human and synthetic data creation and
assessment, scaling to larger models, and better supervision, we propose a set
of strong and precise probability estimation models. We conduct systematic
evaluations across tasks that rely on conditional probability estimation and
show that our approach consistently outperforms existing fine-tuned and
prompting-based methods by a large margin.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a promising approach for text
generation that, unlike traditional language models (LM), does not suffer from
the problem of ``exposure bias''. However, A major hurdle for understanding the
potential of GANs for text generation is the lack of a clear evaluation metric.
In this work, we propose to approximate the distribution of text generated by a
GAN, which permits evaluating them with traditional probability-based LM
metrics. We apply our approximation procedure on several GAN-based models and
show that they currently perform substantially worse than state-of-the-art LMs.
Our evaluation procedure promotes better understanding of the relation between
GANs and LMs, and can accelerate progress in GAN-based text generation.

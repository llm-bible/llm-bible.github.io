Visual programming has the potential of providing novice programmers with a
low-code experience to build customized processing pipelines. Existing systems
typically require users to build pipelines from scratch, implying that novice
users are expected to set up and link appropriate nodes from a blank workspace.
In this paper, we introduce InstructPipe, an AI assistant for prototyping
machine learning (ML) pipelines with text instructions. We contribute two large
language model (LLM) modules and a code interpreter as part of our framework.
The LLM modules generate pseudocode for a target pipeline, and the interpreter
renders the pipeline in the node-graph editor for further human-AI
collaboration. Both technical and user evaluation (N=16) shows that
InstructPipe empowers users to streamline their ML pipeline workflow, reduce
their learning curve, and leverage open-ended commands to spark innovative
ideas.

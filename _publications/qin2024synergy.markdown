The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has been witnessed in recent years. Based on the powerful LLMs multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) extend the modality from text to a broader spectrum of domains attracting widespread attention due to the broader range of application scenarios. As LLMs and MLLMs rely on vast amounts of model parameters and data to achieve emergent capabilities the importance of data is receiving increasingly widespread attention and recognition. Tracing and analyzing recent data-oriented works for MLLMs we find that the development of models and data is not two separate paths but rather interconnected. On the one hand vaster and higher-quality data contribute to better performance of MLLMs; on the other hand MLLMs can facilitate the development of data. The co-development of multi-modal data and MLLMs requires a clear view of 1) at which development stages of MLLMs specific data-centric approaches can be employed to enhance certain MLLM capabilities and 2) how MLLMs utilizing those capabilities can contribute to multi-modal data in specific roles. To promote the data-model co-development for MLLM community we systematically review existing works related to MLLMs from the data-model co-development perspective. A regularly maintained project associated with this survey is accessible at https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/blob/main/docs/awesome\_llm\_data.md."

The development of game agents holds a critical role in advancing towards
Artificial General Intelligence. The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs)
offers an unprecedented opportunity to evolve and empower game agents with
human-like decision-making capabilities in complex computer game environments.
This paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based game agents from a
holistic viewpoint. First, we introduce the conceptual architecture of
LLM-based game agents, centered around three core functional components:
memory, reasoning and in/output. Second, we survey existing representative
LLM-based game agents documented in the literature with respect to
methodologies and adaptation agility across six genres of games, including
adventure, communication, competition, cooperation, simulation, and crafting &
exploration games. Finally, we present an outlook of future research and
development directions in this burgeoning field. A curated list of relevant

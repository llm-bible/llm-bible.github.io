The development of game agents holds a critical role in advancing towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The progress of LLMs and their multimodal counterparts (MLLMs) offers an unprecedented opportunity to evolve and empower game agents with human-like decision-making capabilities in complex computer game environments. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of LLM-based game agents from a holistic viewpoint. First we introduce the conceptual architecture of LLM-based game agents centered around six essential functional components perception memory thinking role-playing action and learning. Second we survey existing representative LLM-based game agents documented in the literature with respect to methodologies and adaptation agility across six genres of games including adventure communication competition cooperation simulation and crafting amp; exploration games. Finally we present an outlook of future research and development directions in this burgeoning field. A curated list of relevant papers is maintained and made accessible at https://github.com/git-disl/awesome-LLM-game-agent-papers."

Since its release in November 2022 ChatGPT has shaken up Stack Overflow the premier platform for developers queries on programming and software development. Demonstrating an ability to generate instant human-like responses to technical questions ChatGPT has ignited debates within the developer community about the evolving role of human-driven platforms in the age of generative AI. Two months after ChatGPTs release Meta released its answer with its own Large Language Model (LLM) called LLaMA the race was on. We conducted an empirical study analyzing questions from Stack Overflow and using these LLMs to address them. This way we aim to (ii) measure user engagement evolution with Stack Overflow over time; (ii) quantify the reliability of LLMs answers and their potential to replace Stack Overflow in the long term; (iii) identify and understand why LLMs fails; and (iv) compare LLMs together. Our empirical results are unequivocal ChatGPT and LLaMA challenge human expertise yet do not outperform it for some domains while a significant decline in user posting activity has been observed. Furthermore we also discuss the impact of our findings regarding the usage and development of new LLMs.

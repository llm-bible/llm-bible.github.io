There have been many recent advances in the fields of generative Artificial
Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM), with the Generative
Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model being a leading "chatbot." LLM-based
chatbots have become so powerful that it may seem difficult to differentiate
between human-written and machine-generated text. To analyze this problem, we
have developed a new dataset consisting of more than 750,000 human-written
paragraphs, with a corresponding chatbot-generated paragraph for each. Based on
this dataset, we apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to determine the origin
of text (human or chatbot). Specifically, we consider two methodologies for
tackling this issue: feature analysis and embeddings. Our feature analysis
approach involves extracting a collection of features from the text for
classification. We also explore the use of contextual embeddings and
transformer-based architectures to train classification models. Our proposed
solutions offer high classification accuracy and serve as useful tools for
textual analysis, resulting in a better understanding of chatbot-generated text
in this era of advanced AI technology.

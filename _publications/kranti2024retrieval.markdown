In the Minecraft Collaborative Building Task two players collaborate an Architect (A) provides instructions to a Builder (B) to assemble a specified structure using 3D blocks. In this work we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) to predict the sequence of actions taken by the Builder. Leveraging LLMs in45;context learning abilities we use few45;shot prompting techniques that significantly improve performance over baseline methods. Additionally we present a detailed analysis of the gaps in performance for future work

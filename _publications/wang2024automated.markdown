A common way of assessing language learners mastery of vocabulary is via multiple45;choice cloze (i.e. fill45;in45;the45;blank) questions. But the creation of test items can be laborious for individual teachers or in large45;scale language programs. In this paper we evaluate a new method for automatically generating these types of questions using large language models (LLM). The VocaTT (vocabulary teaching and training) engine is written in Python and comprises three basic steps pre45;processing target word lists generating sentences and candidate word options using GPT and finally selecting suitable word options. To test the efficiency of this system 60 questions were generated targeting academic words. The generated items were reviewed by expert reviewers who judged the well45;formedness of the sentences and word options adding comments to items judged not well45;formed. Results showed a 7537; rate of well45;formedness for sentences and 66.8537; rate for suitable word options. This is a marked improvement over the generator used earlier in our research which did not take advantage of GPTs capabilities. Post45;hoc qualitative analysis reveals several points for improvement in future work including cross45;referencing part45;of45;speech tagging better sentence validation and improving GPT prompts.

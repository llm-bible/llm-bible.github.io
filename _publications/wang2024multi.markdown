In the deployment of large language models (LLMs) accurate confidence estimation is critical for assessing the credibility of model predictions. However existing methods often fail to overcome the issue of overconfidence on incorrect answers. In this work we focus on improving the confidence estimation of large language models. Considering the fragility of self45;awareness in language models we introduce a Multi45;Perspective Consistency (MPC) method. We leverage complementary insights from different perspectives within models (MPC45;Internal) and across different models (MPC45;Across) to mitigate the issue of overconfidence arising from a singular viewpoint. The experimental results on eight publicly available datasets show that our MPC achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance. Further analyses indicate that MPC can mitigate the problem of overconfidence and is effectively scalable to other models.

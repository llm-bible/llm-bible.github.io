This paper evaluates Few-Shot Prompting with Large Language Models for Named
Entity Recognition (NER). Traditional NER systems rely on extensive labeled
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Few-Shot Prompting or
in-context learning enables models to recognize entities with minimal examples.
We assess state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 in NER tasks, comparing their
few-shot performance to fully supervised benchmarks. Results show that while
there is a performance gap, large models excel in adapting to new entity types
and domains with very limited data. We also explore the effects of prompt
engineering, guided output format and context length on performance. This study
underscores Few-Shot Learning's potential to reduce the need for large labeled
datasets, enhancing NER scalability and accessibility.

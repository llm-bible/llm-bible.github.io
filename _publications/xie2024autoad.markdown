Our objective is to generate Audio Descriptions (ADs) for both movies and TV series in a training45;free manner. We use the power of off45;the45;shelf Visual45;Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) and develop visual and text prompting strategies for this task. Our contributions are three45;fold (i) We demonstrate that a VLM can successfully name and refer to characters if directly prompted with character information through visual indications without requiring any fine45;tuning; (ii) A two45;stage process is developed to generate ADs with the first stage asking the VLM to comprehensively describe the video followed by a second stage utilising a LLM to summarise dense textual information into one succinct AD sentence; (iii) A new dataset for TV audio description is formulated. Our approach named AutoAD45;Zero demonstrates outstanding performance (even competitive with some models fine45;tuned on ground truth ADs) in AD generation for both movies and TV series achieving state45;of45;the45;art CRITIC scores.

Evaluating large language models' (LLMs) long-context understanding
capabilities remains challenging. We present SCALAR (Scientific Citation-based
Live Assessment of Long-context Academic Reasoning), a novel benchmark that
leverages academic papers and their citation networks. SCALAR features
automatic generation of high-quality ground truth labels without human
annotation, controllable difficulty levels, and a dynamic updating mechanism
that prevents data contamination. Using ICLR 2025 papers, we evaluate 8
state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing key insights about their capabilities and
limitations in processing long scientific documents across different context
lengths and reasoning types. Our benchmark provides a reliable and sustainable
way to track progress in long-context understanding as LLM capabilities evolve.

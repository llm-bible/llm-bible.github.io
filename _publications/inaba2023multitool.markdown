Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on various reasoning tasks. To further improve the performance we propose MultiTool45;CoT a novel framework that leverages chain45;of45;thought (CoT) prompting to incorporate multiple external tools such as a calculator and a knowledge retriever during the reasoning process. We apply MultiTool45;CoT to the Task 2 dataset of NumGLUE which requires both numerical reasoning and domain45;specific knowledge. The experiments show that our method significantly outperforms strong baselines and achieves state45;of45;the45;art performance.

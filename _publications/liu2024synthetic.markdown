Despite rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) QG remains a challenging problem due to its complicated process open-ended nature and the diverse settings in which question generation occurs. A common approach to address these challenges involves fine-tuning smaller custom models using datasets containing background context question and answer. However obtaining suitable domain-specific datasets with appropriate context is often more difficult than acquiring question-answer pairs. In this paper we investigate training QG models using synthetic contexts generated by LLMs from readily available question-answer pairs. We conduct a comprehensive study to answer critical research questions related to the performance of models trained on synthetic contexts and their potential impact on QG research and applications. Our empirical results reveal 1) contexts are essential for QG tasks even if they are synthetic; 2) fine-tuning smaller language models has the capability of achieving better performances as compared to prompting larger language models; and 3) synthetic context and real context could achieve comparable performances. These findings highlight the effectiveness of synthetic contexts in QG and paves the way for future advancements in the field.

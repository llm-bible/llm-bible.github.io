This paper focuses on the piloting of CyberScholar, a Generative AI (GenAI)
assistant tool that aims to provide feedback on writing K-12 contexts. The aim
was to use GenAI to provide formative and summative feedback on students' texts
in English Language Arts (ELA), Social Studies, and Modern World History. The
trials discussed in this paper involved Grades 7, 8, 10, and 11 and were
conducted in three schools in the Midwest and one in the Northwest of the
United States. The tool used two main mechanisms: "prompt engineering" based on
participant teachers' assessment rubric and "fine-tuning" a Large Language
Model (LLM) from a customized corpus of teaching materials using Retrieval
Augmented Generation. This paper focuses on CyberScholar's potential to enhance
students' writing abilities and support teachers in diverse subject areas
requiring written assignments.

We introduce MultiBLiMP 1.0, a massively multilingual benchmark of linguistic
minimal pairs, covering 101 languages, 6 linguistic phenomena and containing
more than 125,000 minimal pairs. Our minimal pairs are created using a fully
automated pipeline, leveraging the large-scale linguistic resources of
Universal Dependencies and UniMorph. MultiBLiMP 1.0 evaluates abilities of LLMs
at an unprecedented multilingual scale, and highlights the shortcomings of the
current state-of-the-art in modelling low-resource languages.

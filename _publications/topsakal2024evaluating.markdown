We introduce a novel and extensible benchmark for large language models (LLMs) through grid-based games such as Tic-Tac-Toe Connect Four and Gomoku. The open-source game simulation code available on GitHub allows LLMs to compete and generates detailed data files in JSON CSV TXT and PNG formats for leaderboard rankings and further analysis. We present the results of games among leading LLMs including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Sonnet by Anthropic Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash by Google GPT-4 Turbo and GPT-4o by OpenAI and Llama3-70B by Meta. We also encourage submissions of results from other LLMs. In total we simulated 2310 matches (5 sessions for each pair among 7 LLMs and a random player) across three types of games using three distinct prompt types list illustration and image. The results revealed significant variations in LLM performance across different games and prompt types with analysis covering win and disqualification rates missed opportunity analysis and invalid move analysis. The details of the leaderboard and result matrix data are available as open-access data on GitHub. This study enhances our understanding of LLMs capabilities in playing games they were not specifically trained for helping to assess their rule comprehension and strategic thinking. On the path to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) this study lays the groundwork for future exploration into their utility in complex decision-making scenarios illuminating their strategic thinking abilities and offering directions for further inquiry into the limits of LLMs within game-based frameworks.

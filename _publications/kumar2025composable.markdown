There has been a lot of progress towards building NLP models that scale to
multiple tasks. However, real-world systems contain multiple components and it
is tedious to handle cross-task interaction with varying levels of text
granularity. In this work, we built an end-to-end Ranking and
Question-Answering (QA) system using Forte, a toolkit that makes composable NLP
pipelines. We utilized state-of-the-art deep learning models such as BERT,
RoBERTa in our pipeline, evaluated the performance on MS-MARCO and Covid-19
datasets using metrics such as BLUE, MRR, F1 and compared the results of
ranking and QA systems with their corresponding benchmark results. The modular
nature of our pipeline and low latency of reranker makes it easy to build
complex NLP applications easily.

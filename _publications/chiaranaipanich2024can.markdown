Large language models (LLMs) perform well on common tasks but struggle with
generalization in low-resource and low-computation settings. We examine this
limitation by testing various LLMs and specialized translation models on
English-Thai machine translation and code-switching datasets. Our findings
reveal that under more strict computational constraints, such as 4-bit
quantization, LLMs fail to translate effectively. In contrast, specialized
models, with comparable or lower computational requirements, consistently
outperform LLMs. This underscores the importance of specialized models for
maintaining performance under resource constraints.

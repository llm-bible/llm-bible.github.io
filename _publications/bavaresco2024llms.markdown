There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLM-generated judgments instead of human judgments. In the absence of a comparison against human data this raises concerns about the validity of these evaluations; in case they are conducted with proprietary models this also raises concerns over reproducibility. We provide JUDGE-BENCH a collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs covering both open-weight and proprietary models for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show that each LLM exhibits a large variance across datasets in its correlation to human judgments. We conclude that LLMs are not yet ready to systematically replace human judges in NLP.

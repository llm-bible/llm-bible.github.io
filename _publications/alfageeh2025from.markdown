Background and Context. The increasing integration of large language models
(LLMs) in computing education presents an emerging challenge in understanding
how students use LLMs and craft prompts to solve computational tasks. Prior
research has used both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze
prompting behavior, but these approaches lack scalability or fail to
effectively capture the semantic evolution of prompts. Objective. In this
paper, we investigate whether students prompts can be systematically analyzed
using propositional logic constraints. We examine whether this approach can
identify patterns in prompt evolution, detect struggling students, and provide
insights into effective and ineffective strategies. Method. We introduce
Prompt2Constraints, a novel method that translates students prompts into
logical constraints. The constraints are able to represent the intent of the
prompts in succinct and quantifiable ways. We used this approach to analyze a
dataset of 1,872 prompts from 203 students solving introductory programming
tasks. Findings. We find that while successful and unsuccessful attempts tend
to use a similar number of constraints overall, when students fail, they often
modify their prompts more significantly, shifting problem-solving strategies
midway. We also identify points where specific interventions could be most
helpful to students for refining their prompts. Implications. This work offers
a new and scalable way to detect students who struggle in solving natural
language programming tasks. This work could be extended to investigate more
complex tasks and integrated into programming tools to provide real-time
support.

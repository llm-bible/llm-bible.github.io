Assessing and enhancing human learning through question-answering is vital,
yet automating this process remains challenging. While large language models
(LLMs) excel at summarization and query responses, their ability to generate
meaningful questions for learners is underexplored.
  We propose Savaal, a scalable question-generation system with three
objectives: (i) scalability, enabling question generation from hundreds of
pages of text (ii) depth of understanding, producing questions beyond factual
recall to test conceptual reasoning, and (iii) domain-independence,
automatically generating questions across diverse knowledge areas. Instead of
providing an LLM with large documents as context, Savaal improves results with
a three-stage processing pipeline. Our evaluation with 76 human experts on 71
papers and PhD dissertations shows that Savaal generates questions that better
test depth of understanding by 6.5X for dissertations and 1.5X for papers
compared to a direct-prompting LLM baseline. Notably, as document length
increases, Savaal's advantages in higher question quality and lower cost become
more pronounced.

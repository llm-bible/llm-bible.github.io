The fusion of human-centric design and artificial intelligence (AI)
capabilities has opened up new possibilities for next-generation autonomous
vehicles that go beyond transportation. These vehicles can dynamically interact
with passengers and adapt to their preferences. This paper proposes a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the
decision-making process in autonomous vehicles. By utilizing LLMs' linguistic
and contextual understanding abilities with specialized tools, we aim to
integrate the language and reasoning capabilities of LLMs into autonomous
vehicles. Our research includes experiments in HighwayEnv, a collection of
environments for autonomous driving and tactical decision-making tasks, to
explore LLMs' interpretation, interaction, and reasoning in various scenarios.
We also examine real-time personalization, demonstrating how LLMs can influence
driving behaviors based on verbal commands. Our empirical results highlight the
substantial advantages of utilizing chain-of-thought prompting, leading to
improved driving decisions, and showing the potential for LLMs to enhance
personalized driving experiences through ongoing verbal feedback. The proposed
framework aims to transform autonomous vehicle operations, offering
personalized support, transparent decision-making, and continuous learning to
enhance safety and effectiveness. We achieve user-centric, transparent, and
adaptive autonomous driving ecosystems supported by the integration of LLMs
into autonomous vehicles.

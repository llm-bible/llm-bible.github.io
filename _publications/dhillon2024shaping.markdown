Advances in language modeling have paved the way for novel human45;AI co45;writing experiences. This paper explores how varying levels of scaffolding from large language models (LLMs) shape the co45;writing process. Employing a within45;subjects field experiment with a Latin square design we asked participants (N=131) to respond to argumentative writing prompts under three randomly sequenced conditions no AI assistance (control) next45;sentence suggestions (low scaffolding) and next45;paragraph suggestions (high scaffolding). Our findings reveal a U45;shaped impact of scaffolding on writing quality and productivity (words/time). While low scaffolding did not significantly improve writing quality or productivity high scaffolding led to significant improvements especially benefiting non45;regular writers and less tech45;savvy users. No significant cognitive burden was observed while using the scaffolded writing tools but a moderate decrease in text ownership and satisfaction was noted. Our results have broad implications for the design of AI45;powered writing tools including the need for personalized scaffolding mechanisms.

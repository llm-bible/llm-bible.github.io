The advent of generative artificial intelligence, especially large language
models (LLMs), presents opportunities for innovation in research, clinical
practice, and education. Recently, Dihan et al. lauded LLM tool NotebookLM's
potential, including for generating AI-voiced podcasts to educate patients
about treatment and rehabilitation, and for quickly synthesizing medical
literature for professionals. We argue that NotebookLM presently poses clinical
and technological risks that should be tested and considered prior to its
implementation in clinical practice.

Generative AI, i.e., the group of technologies that automatically generate
visual or written content based on text prompts, has undergone a leap in
complexity and become widely available within just a few years. Such
technologies potentially introduce a massive disruption to creative fields.
This paper presents the results of a qualitative survey (\\(N\\) = 23)
investigating how creative professionals think about generative AI. The results
show that the advancement of these AI models prompts important reflections on
what defines creativity and how creatives imagine using AI to support their
workflows. Based on these reflections, we discuss how we might design
\textit\{participatory AI\} in the domain of creative expertise with the goal of
empowering creative professionals in their present and future coexistence with
AI.

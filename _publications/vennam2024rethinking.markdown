Thinking Tokens (TT) have been proposed as an unsupervised method to
facilitate reasoning in language models. However, despite their conceptual
appeal, our findings show that TTs marginally improves performance and
consistently underperforms compared to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning across
multiple benchmarks. We hypothesize that this underperformance stems from the
reliance on a single embedding for TTs, which results in inconsistent learning
signals and introduces noisy gradients. This paper provides a comprehensive
empirical analysis to validate this hypothesis and discusses the implications
for future research on unsupervised reasoning in LLMs.

One of the primary driving forces contributing to the superior performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is the extensive availability of human-annotated natural language data which is used for alignment fine-tuning. This inspired researchers to investigate self-training methods to mitigate the extensive reliance on human annotations. However the current success of self-training has been primarily observed in natural language scenarios rather than in the increasingly important neural-symbolic scenarios. To this end we propose an environment-guided neural-symbolic self-training framework named ENVISIONS. It aims to overcome two main challenges (1) the scarcity of symbolic data and (2) the limited proficiency of LLMs in processing symbolic language. Extensive evaluations conducted on three distinct domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally we have conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover the factors contributing to ENVISIONSs success thereby offering valuable insights for future research in this area. Code will be available at (urlhttps://github.com/xufangzhi/ENVISIONS\}\)."

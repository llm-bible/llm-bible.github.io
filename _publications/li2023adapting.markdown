Online education platforms leveraging the internet to distribute education resources seek to provide convenient education but often fall short in real-time communication with students. They often struggle to address the diverse obstacles students encounter throughout their learning journey. Solving the problems encountered by students poses a significant challenge for traditional deep learning models as it requires not only a broad spectrum of subject knowledge but also the ability to understand what constitutes a students individual difficulties. Its challenging for traditional machine learning models as they lack the capacity to comprehend students personalized needs. Recently the emergence of large language models (LLMs) offers the possibility for resolving this issue by comprehending individual requests. Although LLMs have been successful in various fields creating an LLM-based education system is still challenging for the wide range of educational skills required. This paper reviews the recently emerged LLM research related to educational capabilities including mathematics writing programming reasoning and knowledge-based question answering with the aim to explore their potential in constructing the next-generation intelligent education system. Specifically for each capability we focus on investigating two aspects. Firstly we examine the current state of LLMs regarding this capability how advanced they have become whether they surpass human abilities and what deficiencies might exist. Secondly we evaluate whether the development methods for LLMs in this area are generalizable that is whether these methods can be applied to construct a comprehensive educational supermodel with strengths across various capabilities rather than being effective in only a singular aspect.

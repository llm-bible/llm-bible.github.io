In this paper, we introduce ConversaSynth, a framework designed to generate
synthetic conversation audio using large language models (LLMs) with multiple
persona settings. The framework first creates diverse and coherent text-based
dialogues across various topics, which are then converted into audio using
text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Our experiments demonstrate that ConversaSynth
effectively generates highquality synthetic audio datasets, which can
significantly enhance the training and evaluation of models for audio tagging,
audio classification, and multi-speaker speech recognition. The results
indicate that the synthetic datasets generated by ConversaSynth exhibit
substantial diversity and realism, making them suitable for developing robust,
adaptable audio-based AI systems.

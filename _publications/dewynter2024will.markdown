We show that GPT45;4s reasoning and planning capabilities extend to the 1993 first45;person shooter Doom. This large language model (LLM) is able to run and play the game with only a few instructions plus a textual description45;45;generated by the model itself from screenshots45;45;about the state of the game being observed. We find that GPT45;4 can play the game to a passable degree it is able to manipulate doors combat enemies and perform pathing. More complex prompting strategies involving multiple model calls provide better results. While further work is required to enable the LLM to play the game as well as its classical reinforcement learning45;based counterparts we note that GPT45;4 required no training leaning instead on its own reasoning and observational capabilities. We hope our work pushes the boundaries on intelligent LLM45;based agents in video games. We conclude by discussing the ethical implications of our work.

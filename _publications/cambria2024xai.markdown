In this survey we address the key challenges in Large Language Models (LLM) research focusing on the importance of interpretability. Driven by increasing interest from AI and business sectors we highlight the need for transparency in LLMs. We examine the dual paths in current LLM research and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) enhancing performance through XAI and the emerging focus on model interpretability. Our paper advocates for a balanced approach that values interpretability equally with functional advancements. Recognizing the rapid development in LLM research our survey includes both peer-reviewed and preprint (arXiv) papers offering a comprehensive overview of XAIs role in LLM research. We conclude by urging the research community to advance both LLM and XAI fields together.

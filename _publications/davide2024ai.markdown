We tasked 16 state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) with estimating
the likelihood of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) emerging by 2030. To
assess the quality of these forecasts, we implemented an automated peer review
process (LLM-PR). The LLMs' estimates varied widely, ranging from 3% (Reka-
Core) to 47.6% (GPT-4o), with a median of 12.5%. These estimates closely align
with a recent expert survey that projected a 10% likelihood of AGI by 2027,
underscoring the relevance of LLMs in forecasting complex, speculative
scenarios. The LLM-PR process demonstrated strong reliability, evidenced by a
high Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC = 0.79), reflecting notable
consistency in scoring across the models. Among the models, Pplx-70b-online
emerged as the top performer, while Gemini-1.5-pro-api ranked the lowest. A
cross-comparison with external benchmarks, such as LMSYS Chatbot Arena,
revealed that LLM rankings remained consistent across different evaluation
methods, suggesting that existing benchmarks may not encapsulate some of the
skills relevant for AGI prediction. We further explored the use of weighting
schemes based on external benchmarks, optimizing the alignment of LLMs'
predictions with human expert forecasts. This analysis led to the development
of a new, 'AGI benchmark' designed to highlight performance differences in
AGI-related tasks. Our findings offer insights into LLMs' capabilities in
speculative, interdisciplinary forecasting tasks and emphasize the growing need
for innovative evaluation frameworks for assessing AI performance in complex,
uncertain real-world scenarios.

Modern conversational agents, including anime-themed chatbots, are frequently
reactive and personality-driven but fail to capture the dynamic nature of human
interactions. We propose an event-driven dialogue framework to address these
limitations by embedding dynamic events in conversation prompts and fine-tuning
models on character-specific data. Evaluations on GPT-4 and comparisons with
industry-leading baselines demonstrate that event-driven prompts significantly
improve conversational engagement and naturalness while reducing
hallucinations. This paper explores the application of this approach in
creating lifelike chatbot interactions within the context of Honkai: Star Rail,
showcasing the potential for dynamic event-based systems to transform
role-playing and interactive dialogue.

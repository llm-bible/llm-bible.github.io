Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing
tasks successfully. Yet, their large size and high computational needs pose
challenges for practical use, especially in resource-limited settings. Model
compression has emerged as a key research area to address these challenges.
This paper presents a survey of model compression techniques for LLMs. We cover
methods like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, highlighting
recent advancements. We also discuss benchmarking strategies and evaluation
metrics crucial for assessing compressed LLMs. This survey offers valuable
insights for researchers and practitioners, aiming to enhance efficiency and
real-world applicability of LLMs while laying a foundation for future
advancements.

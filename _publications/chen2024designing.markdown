Conversational LLMs function as black box systems leaving users guessing about why they see the output they do. This lack of transparency is potentially problematic especially given concerns around bias and truthfulness. To address this issue we present an end-to-end prototype-connecting interpretability techniques with user experience design-that seeks to make chatbots more transparent. We begin by showing evidence that a prominent open-source LLM has a user model examining the internal state of the system we can extract data related to a users age gender educational level and socioeconomic status. Next we describe the design of a dashboard that accompanies the chatbot interface displaying this user model in real time. The dashboard can also be used to control the user model and the systems behavior. Finally we discuss a study in which users conversed with the instrumented system. Our results suggest that users appreciate seeing internal states which helped them expose biased behavior and increased their sense of control. Participants also made valuable suggestions that point to future directions for both design and machine learning research.

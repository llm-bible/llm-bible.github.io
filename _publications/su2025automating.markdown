Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential and
impressive performance in automating the generation and optimization of
workflows. However, existing approaches are marked by limited reasoning
capabilities, high computational demands, and significant resource
requirements. To address these issues, we propose DebFlow, a framework that
employs a debate mechanism to optimize workflows and integrates reflexion to
improve based on previous experiences. We evaluated our method across six
benchmark datasets, including HotpotQA, MATH, and ALFWorld. Our approach
achieved a 3% average performance improvement over the latest baselines,
demonstrating its effectiveness in diverse problem domains. In particular,
during training, our framework reduces resource consumption by 37% compared to
the state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we performed ablation studies.
Removing the Debate component resulted in a 4% performance drop across two
benchmark datasets, significantly greater than the 2% drop observed when the
Reflection component was removed. These findings strongly demonstrate the
critical role of Debate in enhancing framework performance, while also
highlighting the auxiliary contribution of reflexion to overall optimization.

This paper explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in spear phishing
message generation and evaluates their performance compared to human-authored
counterparts. Our pilot study examines the effectiveness of smishing (SMS
phishing) messages created by GPT-4 and human authors, which have been
personalized for willing targets. The targets assessed these messages in a
modified ranked-order experiment using a novel methodology we call TRAPD
(Threshold Ranking Approach for Personalized Deception). Experiments involved
ranking each spear phishing message from most to least convincing, providing
qualitative feedback, and guessing which messages were human- or AI-generated.
Results show that LLM-generated messages are often perceived as more convincing
than those authored by humans, particularly job-related messages. Targets also
struggled to distinguish between human- and AI-generated messages. We analyze
different criteria the targets used to assess the persuasiveness and source of
messages. This study aims to highlight the urgent need for further research and
improved countermeasures against personalized AI-enabled social engineering
attacks.

We introduce DataComp for Language Models (DCLM), a testbed for controlled
dataset experiments with the goal of improving language models. As part of
DCLM, we provide a standardized corpus of 240T tokens extracted from Common
Crawl, effective pretraining recipes based on the OpenLM framework, and a broad
suite of 53 downstream evaluations. Participants in the DCLM benchmark can
experiment with data curation strategies such as deduplication, filtering, and
data mixing at model scales ranging from 412M to 7B parameters. As a baseline
for DCLM, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model-based filtering
is key to assembling a high-quality training set. The resulting dataset,
DCLM-Baseline enables training a 7B parameter language model from scratch to
64% 5-shot accuracy on MMLU with 2.6T training tokens. Compared to MAP-Neo, the
previous state-of-the-art in open-data language models, DCLM-Baseline
represents a 6.6 percentage point improvement on MMLU while being trained with
40% less compute. Our baseline model is also comparable to Mistral-7B-v0.3 and
Llama 3 8B on MMLU (63% & 66%), and performs similarly on an average of 53
natural language understanding tasks while being trained with 6.6x less compute
than Llama 3 8B. Our results highlight the importance of dataset design for
training language models and offer a starting point for further research on
data curation.

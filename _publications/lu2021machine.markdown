Benchmark datasets have a significant impact on accelerating research in
programming language tasks. In this paper, we introduce CodeXGLUE, a benchmark
dataset to foster machine learning research for program understanding and
generation. CodeXGLUE includes a collection of 10 tasks across 14 datasets and
a platform for model evaluation and comparison. CodeXGLUE also features three
baseline systems, including the BERT-style, GPT-style, and Encoder-Decoder
models, to make it easy for researchers to use the platform. The availability
of such data and baselines can help the development and validation of new
methods that can be applied to various program understanding and generation
problems.

LLMs such as ChatGPT have been widely adopted by students in higher education
as tools for learning programming and related concepts. However, it remains
unclear how effective students are and what strategies students use while
learning with LLMs. Since the majority of students' experiences in online
self-learning have come through using search engines such as Google, evaluating
AI tools in this context can help us address these gaps. In this mixed methods
research, we conducted an exploratory within-subjects study to understand how
CS2 students learn programming concepts using both LLMs as well as traditional
online methods such as educational websites and videos to examine how students
approach learning within and across both scenarios. We discovered that students
found it easier to learn a more difficult concept using traditional methods
than using ChatGPT. We also found that students ask fewer follow-ups and use
more keyword-based queries for search engines while their prompts to LLMs tend
to explicitly ask for information.

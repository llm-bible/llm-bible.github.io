With the vast and dynamic user-generated content on Roblox, creating
effective game recommendations requires a deep understanding of game content.
Traditional recommendation models struggle with the inconsistent and sparse
nature of game text features such as titles and descriptions. Recent
advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
recommendation systems by analyzing in-game text data. This paper addresses two
challenges: generating high-quality, structured text features for games without
extensive human annotation, and validating these features to ensure they
improve recommendation relevance. We propose an approach that extracts in-game
text and uses LLMs to infer attributes such as genre and gameplay objectives
from raw player interactions. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based
re-ranking mechanism to assess the effectiveness of the generated text
features, enhancing personalization and user satisfaction. Beyond
recommendations, our approach supports applications such as user
engagement-based integrity detection, already deployed in production. This
scalable framework demonstrates the potential of in-game text understanding to
improve recommendation quality on Roblox and adapt recommendations to its
unique, user-generated ecosystem.

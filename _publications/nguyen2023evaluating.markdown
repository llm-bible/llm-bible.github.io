In this paper, we evaluate the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
perform multiple choice symbol binding (MCSB) for multiple choice question
answering (MCQA) tasks in zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings. We focus
on Vietnamese, with fewer challenging MCQA datasets than in English. The two
existing datasets, ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0, focus on literature. Recent
research in Vietnamese natural language processing (NLP) has focused on the
Vietnamese National High School Graduation Examination (VNHSGE) from 2019 to
2023 to evaluate ChatGPT. However, these studies have mainly focused on how
ChatGPT solves the VNHSGE step by step. We aim to create a novel and
high-quality dataset by providing structured guidelines for typing LaTeX
formulas for mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. This dataset can be
used to evaluate the MCSB ability of LLMs and smaller language models (LMs)
because it is typed in a strict LaTeX style. We focus on predicting the
character (A, B, C, or D) that is the most likely answer to a question, given
the context of the question. Our evaluation of six well-known LLMs, namely
BLOOMZ-7.1B-MT, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-70B, GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.0, on the
ViMMRC 1.0 and ViMMRC 2.0 benchmarks and our proposed dataset shows promising
results on the MCSB ability of LLMs for Vietnamese. The dataset is available
for research purposes only.

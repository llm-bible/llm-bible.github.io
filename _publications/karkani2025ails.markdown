Multilingual hallucination detection stands as an underexplored challenge,
which the Mu-SHROOM shared task seeks to address. In this work, we propose an
efficient, training-free LLM prompting strategy that enhances detection by
translating multilingual text spans into English. Our approach achieves
competitive rankings across multiple languages, securing two first positions in
low-resource languages. The consistency of our results highlights the
effectiveness of our translation strategy for hallucination detection,
demonstrating its applicability regardless of the source language.

Medical report generation is the task of automatically writing radiology
reports for chest X-ray images. Manually composing these reports is a
time-consuming process that is also prone to human errors. Generating medical
reports can therefore help reduce the burden on radiologists. In other words,
we can promote greater clinical automation in the medical domain. In this work,
we propose a new framework leveraging vision-enabled Large Language Models
(LLM) for the task of medical report generation. We introduce a lightweight
solution that achieves better or comparative performance as compared to
previous solutions on the task of medical report generation. We conduct
extensive experiments exploring different model sizes and enhancement
approaches, such as prefix tuning to improve the text generation abilities of
the LLMs. We evaluate our approach on a prominent large-scale radiology report
dataset - MIMIC-CXR. Our results demonstrate the capability of our
resource-efficient framework to generate patient-specific reports with strong
medical contextual understanding and high precision.

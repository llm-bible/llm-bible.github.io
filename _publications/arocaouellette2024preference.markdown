Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating AI agents that
deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the
potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often
produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and
individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a
method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring
preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement
of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent
components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We
evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new
text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human
preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2% (gridworld environment)
and 41.0% (PLUME).

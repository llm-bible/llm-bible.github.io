In this work we present a comprehensive exploration of finetuning Malaysian language models specifically Llama2 and Mistral on embedding tasks involving negative and positive pairs. We release two distinct models tailored for Semantic Similarity and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For Semantic Similarity our 600 million parameter Llama2 model outperforms OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 across all recall35;64;k metrics for b.cari.com.my c.cari.com.my Malay news and Malaysian Twitter test sets. In the realm of RAG models our approach proves competitive with OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 in the Malaysian context. Notably our 2 billion parameter Llama2 model achieves superior Recall35;64;5 Recall35;64;10 for the Melayu keyword research papers dataset and excels in Recall35;64;3 Recall35;64;5 and Recall35;64;10 for the lom.agc.gov.my dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our finetuning strategy and highlight the performance gains in both Semantic Similarity and RAG tasks.

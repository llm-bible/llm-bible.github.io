In this report, we present Qwen2.5-Omni, an end-to-end multimodal model
designed to perceive diverse modalities, including text, images, audio, and
video, while simultaneously generating text and natural speech responses in a
streaming manner. To enable the streaming of multimodal information inputs,
both audio and visual encoders utilize a block-wise processing approach. To
synchronize the timestamps of video inputs with audio, we organize the audio
and video sequentially in an interleaved manner and propose a novel position
embedding approach, named TMRoPE(Time-aligned Multimodal RoPE). To concurrently
generate text and speech while avoiding interference between the two
modalities, we propose \textbf\{Thinker-Talker\} architecture. In this framework,
Thinker functions as a large language model tasked with text generation, while
Talker is a dual-track autoregressive model that directly utilizes the hidden
representations from the Thinker to produce audio tokens as output. Both the
Thinker and Talker models are designed to be trained and inferred in an
end-to-end manner. For decoding audio tokens in a streaming manner, we
introduce a sliding-window DiT that restricts the receptive field, aiming to
reduce the initial package delay. Qwen2.5-Omni is comparable with the similarly
sized Qwen2.5-VL and outperforms Qwen2-Audio. Furthermore, Qwen2.5-Omni
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal benchmarks like Omni-Bench.
Notably, Qwen2.5-Omni's performance in end-to-end speech instruction following
is comparable to its capabilities with text inputs, as evidenced by benchmarks
such as MMLU and GSM8K. As for speech generation, Qwen2.5-Omni's streaming
Talker outperforms most existing streaming and non-streaming alternatives in
robustness and naturalness.

Responses generated by neural conversational models tend to lack
informativeness and diversity. We present Adversarial Information Maximization
(AIM), an adversarial learning strategy that addresses these two related but
distinct problems. To foster response diversity, we leverage adversarial
training that allows distributional matching of synthetic and real responses.
To improve informativeness, our framework explicitly optimizes a variational
lower bound on pairwise mutual information between query and response.
Empirical results from automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our
methods significantly boost informativeness and diversity.

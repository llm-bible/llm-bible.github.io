Objective: This study aims to develop and validate an evaluation framework to
ensure the safety and reliability of mental health chatbots, which are
increasingly popular due to their accessibility, human-like interactions, and
context-aware support. Materials and Methods: We created an evaluation
framework with 100 benchmark questions and ideal responses, and five guideline
questions for chatbot responses. This framework, validated by mental health
experts, was tested on a GPT-3.5-turbo-based chatbot. Automated evaluation
methods explored included large language model (LLM)-based scoring, an agentic
approach using real-time data, and embedding models to compare chatbot
responses against ground truth standards. Results: The results highlight the
importance of guidelines and ground truth for improving LLM evaluation
accuracy. The agentic method, dynamically accessing reliable information,
demonstrated the best alignment with human assessments. Adherence to a
standardized, expert-validated framework significantly enhanced chatbot
response safety and reliability. Discussion: Our findings emphasize the need
for comprehensive, expert-tailored safety evaluation metrics for mental health
chatbots. While LLMs have significant potential, careful implementation is
necessary to mitigate risks. The superior performance of the agentic approach
underscores the importance of real-time data access in enhancing chatbot
reliability. Conclusion: The study validated an evaluation framework for mental
health chatbots, proving its effectiveness in improving safety and reliability.
Future work should extend evaluations to accuracy, bias, empathy, and privacy
to ensure holistic assessment and responsible integration into healthcare.
Standardized evaluations will build trust among users and professionals,
facilitating broader adoption and improved mental health support through
technology.

Our research investigates the potential of Large-scale Language Models (LLMs) specifically OpenAIs GPT in credit risk assessment-a binary classification task. Our findings suggest that LLMs when directed by judiciously designed prompts and supplemented with domain-specific knowledge can parallel the performance of traditional Machine Learning (ML) models. Intriguingly they achieve this with significantly less data-40 times less utilizing merely 20 data points compared to the MLs 800. LLMs particularly excel in minimizing false positives and enhancing fairness both being vital aspects of risk analysis. While our results did not surpass those of classical ML models they underscore the potential of LLMs in analogous tasks laying a groundwork for future explorations into harnessing the capabilities of LLMs in diverse ML tasks.

The uncanny valley effect poses a significant challenge in the development
and acceptance of hyper-realistic social robots. This study investigates
whether advanced conversational capabilities powered by large language models
(LLMs) can mitigate this effect in highly anthropomorphic robots. We conducted
a user study with 80 participants interacting with Nadine, a hyper-realistic
humanoid robot equipped with LLM-driven communication skills. Through pre- and
post-interaction surveys, we assessed changes in perceptions of uncanniness,
conversational quality, and overall user experience. Our findings reveal that
LLM-enhanced interactions significantly reduce feelings of eeriness while
fostering more natural and engaging conversations. Additionally, we identify
key factors influencing user acceptance, including conversational naturalness,
human-likeness, and interestingness. Based on these insights, we propose design
recommendations to enhance the appeal and acceptability of hyper-realistic
robots in social contexts. This research contributes to the growing field of
human-robot interaction by offering empirical evidence on the potential of LLMs
to bridge the uncanny valley, with implications for the future development of
social robots.

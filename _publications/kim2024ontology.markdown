Knowledge Graph45;to45;Text (G2T) generation involves verbalizing structured knowledge graphs into natural language text. Recent advancements in Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) have improved G2T performance but their effectiveness depends on datasets with precise graph45;text alignment. However the scarcity of high45;quality general45;domain G2T generation datasets restricts progress in the general45;domain G2T generation research. To address this issue we introduce Wikipedia Ontology45;Free Graph45;text dataset (WikiOFGraph) a new large45;scale G2T dataset generated using a novel method that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) and Data45;QuestEval. Our new dataset which contains 5.85M general45;domain graph45;text pairs offers high graph45;text consistency without relying on external ontologies. Experimental results demonstrate that PLM fine45;tuned on WikiOFGraph outperforms those trained on other datasets across various evaluation metrics. Our method proves to be a scalable and effective solution for generating high45;quality G2T data significantly advancing the field of G2T generation.

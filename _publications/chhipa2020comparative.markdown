With the recent influx of bidirectional contextualized transformer language models in the NLP it becomes a necessity to have a systematic comparative study of these models on variety of datasets. Also the performance of these language models has not been explored on non45;GLUE datasets. The study presented in paper compares the state45;of45;the45;art language models 45; BERT ELECTRA and its derivatives which include RoBERTa ALBERT and DistilBERT. We conducted experiments by finetuning these models for cross domain and disparate data and penned an in45;depth analysis of models performances. Moreover an explainability of language models coherent with pretraining is presented which verifies the context capturing capabilities of these models through a model agnostic approach. The experimental results establish new state45;of45;the45;art for Yelp 2013 rating classification task and Financial Phrasebank sentiment detection task with 6937; accuracy and 88.237; accuracy respectively. Finally the study conferred here can greatly assist industry researchers in choosing the language model effectively in terms of performance or compute efficiency.

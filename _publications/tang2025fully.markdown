Large Language Model (LLM) Agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in task automation and intelligent decision-making, driving the widespread
adoption of agent development frameworks such as LangChain and AutoGen.
However, these frameworks predominantly serve developers with extensive
technical expertise - a significant limitation considering that only 0.03 % of
the global population possesses the necessary programming skills. This stark
accessibility gap raises a fundamental question: Can we enable everyone,
regardless of technical background, to build their own LLM agents using natural
language alone? To address this challenge, we introduce AutoAgent-a
Fully-Automated and highly Self-Developing framework that enables users to
create and deploy LLM agents through Natural Language Alone. Operating as an
autonomous Agent Operating System, AutoAgent comprises four key components: i)
Agentic System Utilities, ii) LLM-powered Actionable Engine, iii) Self-Managing
File System, and iv) Self-Play Agent Customization module. This lightweight yet
powerful system enables efficient and dynamic creation and modification of
tools, agents, and workflows without coding requirements or manual
intervention. Beyond its code-free agent development capabilities, AutoAgent
also serves as a versatile multi-agent system for General AI Assistants.
Comprehensive evaluations on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate AutoAgent's
effectiveness in generalist multi-agent tasks, surpassing existing
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, AutoAgent's Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG)-related capabilities have shown consistently superior
performance compared to many alternative LLM-based solutions.

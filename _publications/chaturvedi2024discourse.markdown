When engaging in collaborative tasks humans efficiently exploit the semantic structure of a conversation to optimize verbal and nonverbal interactions. But in recent language to code or language to action models this information is lacking. We show how incorporating the prior discourse and nonlinguistic context of a conversation situated in a nonlinguistic environment can improve the language to action component of such interactions. We fine tune an LLM to predict actions based on prior context; our model NeBuLa doubles the net-action F1 score over the baseline on this task of Jayannavar et al.(2020). We also investigate our models ability to construct shapes and understand location descriptions using a synthetic dataset.

In this work, we unveil a novel tool for generating Italian crossword puzzles
from text, utilizing advanced language models such as GPT-4o,
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and Llama3-8b-Instruct. Crafted specifically for
educational applications, this cutting-edge generator makes use of the
comprehensive Italian-Clue-Instruct dataset, which comprises over 30,000
entries including diverse text, solutions, and types of clues. This carefully
assembled dataset is designed to facilitate the creation of contextually
relevant clues in various styles associated with specific texts and keywords.
The study delves into four distinctive styles of crossword clues: those without
format constraints, those formed as definite determiner phrases, copular
sentences, and bare noun phrases. Each style introduces unique linguistic
structures to diversify clue presentation. Given the lack of sophisticated
educational tools tailored to the Italian language, this project seeks to
enhance learning experiences and cognitive development through an engaging,
interactive platform. By meshing state-of-the-art AI with contemporary
educational strategies, our tool can dynamically generate crossword puzzles
from Italian educational materials, thereby providing an enjoyable and
interactive learning environment. This technological advancement not only
redefines educational paradigms but also sets a new benchmark for interactive
and cognitive language learning solutions.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities across numerous disciplines primarily assessed through tasks in language generation knowledge utilization and complex reasoning. However their alignment with human emotions and values which is critical for real-world applications has not been systematically evaluated. Here we assessed LLMs Emotional Intelligence (EI) encompassing emotion recognition interpretation and understanding which is necessary for effective communication and social interactions. Specifically we first developed a novel psychometric assessment focusing on Emotion Understanding (EU) a core component of EI suitable for both humans and LLMs. This test requires evaluating complex emotions (e.g. surprised joyful puzzled proud) in realistic scenarios (e.g. despite feeling underperformed John surprisingly achieved a top score). With a reference frame constructed from over 500 adults we tested a variety of mainstream LLMs. Most achieved above-average EQ scores with GPT-4 exceeding 8937; of human participants with an EQ of 117. Interestingly a multivariate pattern analysis revealed that some LLMs apparently did not reply on the human-like mechanism to achieve human-level performance as their representational patterns were qualitatively distinct from humans. In addition we discussed the impact of factors such as model size training method and architecture on LLMs EQ. In summary our study presents one of the first psychometric evaluations of the human-like characteristics of LLMs which may shed light on the future development of LLMs aiming for both high intellectual and emotional intelligence.

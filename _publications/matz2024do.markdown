What makes people click on a first date and become mutually attracted to one another While understanding and predicting the dynamics of romantic interactions used to be exclusive to human judgment we show that Large Language Models (LLMs) can detect romantic attraction during brief getting45;to45;know45;you interactions. Examining data from 964 speed dates we show that ChatGPT (and Claude 3) can predict both objective and subjective indicators of speed dating success (r=0.1245;0.23). ChatGPTs predictions of actual matching (i.e. the exchange of contact information) were not only on par with those of human judges who had access to the same information but incremental to speed daters own predictions. While some of the variance in ChatGPTs predictions can be explained by common content dimensions (such as the valence of the conversations) the fact that there remains a substantial proportion of unexplained variance suggests that ChatGPT also picks up on conversational dynamics. In addition ChatGPTs judgments showed substantial overlap with those made by the human observers (mean r=0.29) highlighting similarities in their representation of romantic attraction that is partially independent of accuracy.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have fast become an essential tools to many
conversational chatbots due to their ability to provide coherent answers for
varied queries. Datasets used to train these LLMs are often a mix of generic
and synthetic samples, thus lacking the verification needed to provide correct
and verifiable answers for T.V. News.
  We collect and share a large collection of QA pairs extracted from
transcripts of news recordings from various news-channels across the United
States. Resultant QA pairs are then used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf LLM
model. Our model surpasses base models of similar size on several open LLM
benchmarks. We further integrate and propose a RAG method to improve
contextualization of our answers and also point it to a verifiable news
recording.

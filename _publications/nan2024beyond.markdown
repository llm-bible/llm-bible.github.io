Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, garnering significant attention
in AI communities. However, their performance and reliability in specialized
domains such as medicine remain insufficiently assessed. In particular, most
assessments over-concentrate on evaluating VLMs based on simple Visual Question
Answering (VQA) on multi-modality data, while ignoring the in-depth
characteristics of LVLMs. In this study, we introduce RadVUQA, a novel
Radiological Visual Understanding and Question Answering benchmark, to
comprehensively evaluate existing LVLMs. RadVUQA mainly validates LVLMs across
five dimensions: 1) Anatomical understanding, assessing the models' ability to
visually identify biological structures; 2) Multimodal comprehension, which
involves the capability of interpreting linguistic and visual instructions to
produce desired outcomes; 3) Quantitative and spatial reasoning, evaluating the
models' spatial awareness and proficiency in combining quantitative analysis
with visual and linguistic information; 4) Physiological knowledge, measuring
the models' capability to comprehend functions and mechanisms of organs and
systems; and 5) Robustness, which assesses the models' capabilities against
unharmonized and synthetic data. The results indicate that both generalized
LVLMs and medical-specific LVLMs have critical deficiencies with weak
multimodal comprehension and quantitative reasoning capabilities. Our findings
reveal the large gap between existing LVLMs and clinicians, highlighting the
urgent need for more robust and intelligent LVLMs. The code is available at

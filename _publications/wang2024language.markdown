Despite progress in video-language modeling the computational challenge of interpreting long-form videos in response to task-specific linguistic queries persists largely due to the complexity of high-dimensional video data and the misalignment between language and visual cues over space and time. To tackle this issue we introduce a novel approach called Language-guided Spatial-Temporal Prompt Learning (LSTP). This approach features two key components a Temporal Prompt Sampler (TPS) with optical flow prior that leverages temporal information to efficiently extract relevant video content and a Spatial Prompt Solver (SPS) that adeptly captures the intricate spatial relationships between visual and textual elements. By harmonizing TPS and SPS with a cohesive training strategy our framework significantly enhances computational efficiency temporal understanding and spatial-temporal alignment. Empirical evaluations across two challenging tasks--video question answering and temporal question grounding in videos--using a variety of video-language pretrainings (VLPs) and large language models (LLMs) demonstrate the superior performance speed and versatility of our proposed LSTP paradigm.

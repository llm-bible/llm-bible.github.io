The increasing application of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
across various sectors have spotlighted the essence of their output reliability
and accuracy, particularly their ability to produce content grounded in factual
information (e.g. common and domain-specific knowledge). In this work, we
introduce SimpleVQA, the first comprehensive multi-modal benchmark to evaluate
the factuality ability of MLLMs to answer natural language short questions.
SimpleVQA is characterized by six key features: it covers multiple tasks and
multiple scenarios, ensures high quality and challenging queries, maintains
static and timeless reference answers, and is straightforward to evaluate. Our
approach involves categorizing visual question-answering items into 9 different
tasks around objective events or common knowledge and situating these within 9
topics. Rigorous quality control processes are implemented to guarantee
high-quality, concise, and clear answers, facilitating evaluation with minimal
variance via an LLM-as-a-judge scoring system. Using SimpleVQA, we perform a
comprehensive assessment of leading 18 MLLMs and 8 text-only LLMs, delving into
their image comprehension and text generation abilities by identifying and
analyzing error cases.

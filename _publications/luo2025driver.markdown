With the rapid development of China high-speed railway, drivers face
increasingly significant technical challenges during operations, such as fault
handling. Currently, drivers depend on the onboard mechanic when facing
technical issues, for instance, traction loss or sensor faults. This dependency
can hinder effective operation, even lead to accidents, while waiting for
faults to be addressed. To enhance the accuracy and explainability of actions
during fault handling, an Intelligent Driver Advisory System (IDAS) framework
based on a large language model (LLM) named IDAS-LLM, is introduced. Initially,
domain-fine-tuning of the LLM is performed using a constructed railway
knowledge question-and-answer dataset to improve answer accuracy in
railway-related questions. Subsequently, integration of the Retrieval-augmented
Generation (RAG) architecture is pursued for system design to enhance the
explainability of generated responses. Comparative experiments are conducted
using the constructed railway driving knowledge assessment dataset. Results
indicate that domain-fine-tuned LLMs show an improvement in answer accuracy by
an average of 10%, outperforming some current mainstream LLMs. Additionally,
the inclusion of the RAG framework increases the average recall rate of
question-and-answer sessions by about 4%. Finally, the fault handling
capability of IDAS-LLM is demonstrated through simulations of real operational
scenarios, proving that the proposed framework has practical application
prospects.

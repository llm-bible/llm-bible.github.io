Mixtral a representative sparse mixture of experts (SMoE) language model has received significant attention due to its unique model design and superior performance. Based on Mixtral45;8x7B45;v0.1 in this paper we propose Chinese45;Mixtral and Chinese45;Mixtral45;Instruct with improved Chinese language abilities by adopting further pre45;training and instruction fine45;tuning. Experimental results show that our Chinese45;Mixtral and Chinese45;Mixtral45;Instruct successfully improve Chinese understanding and generation performance while retaining the original English abilities. Then we discuss several key questions when performing language adaptation on large language models including the necessity of extending the language45;specific vocabulary and the choice of the initialization model (foundation model v.s. instruction model) by providing empirical results and analysis. We also present the visualizations of each expert to examine their importance on downstream tasks.

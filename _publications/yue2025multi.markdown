Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced legal intelligence,
but the scarcity of scenario data impedes the progress toward interactive legal
scenarios. This paper introduces a Multi-agent Legal Simulation Driver (MASER)
to scalably generate synthetic data by simulating interactive legal scenarios.
Leveraging real-legal case sources, MASER ensures the consistency of legal
attributes between participants and introduces a supervisory mechanism to align
participants' characters and behaviors as well as addressing distractions. A
Multi-stage Interactive Legal Evaluation (MILE) benchmark is further
constructed to evaluate LLMs' performance in dynamic legal scenarios. Extensive
experiments confirm the effectiveness of our framework.

Semantic consistency of a language model is broadly defined as the models ability to produce semantically45;equivalent outputs given semantically45;equivalent inputs. We address the task of assessing question45;answering (QA) semantic consistency of contemporary large language models (LLMs) by manually creating a benchmark dataset with high45;quality paraphrases for factual questions and release the dataset to the community. We further combine the semantic consistency metric with additional measurements suggested in prior work as correlating with LLM QA accuracy for building and evaluating a framework for factual QA reference45;less performance prediction 45;45; predicting the likelihood of a language model to accurately answer a question. Evaluating the framework on five contemporary LLMs we demonstrate encouraging significantly outperforming baselines results.

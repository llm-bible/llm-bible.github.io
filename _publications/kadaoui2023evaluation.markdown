Despite the purported multilingual proficiency of instruction-finetuned large
language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Bard, the linguistic inclusivity of
these models remains insufficiently explored. Considering this constraint, we
present a thorough assessment of Bard and ChatGPT (encompassing both GPT-3.5
and GPT-4) regarding their machine translation proficiencies across ten
varieties of Arabic. Our evaluation covers diverse Arabic varieties such as
Classical Arabic (CA), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and several country-level
dialectal variants. Our analysis indicates that LLMs may encounter challenges
with dialects for which minimal public datasets exist, but on average are
better translators of dialects than existing commercial systems. On CA and MSA,
instruction-tuned LLMs, however, trail behind commercial systems such as Google
Translate. Finally, we undertake a human-centric study to scrutinize the
efficacy of the relatively recent model, Bard, in following human instructions
during translation tasks. Our analysis reveals a circumscribed capability of
Bard in aligning with human instructions in translation contexts. Collectively,
our findings underscore that prevailing LLMs remain far from inclusive, with
only limited ability to cater for the linguistic and cultural intricacies of
diverse communities.

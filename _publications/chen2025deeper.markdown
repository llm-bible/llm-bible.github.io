To advance personalized applications such as recommendation systems and user
behavior prediction, recent research increasingly adopts large language models
(LLMs) for human -readable persona modeling. In dynamic real -world scenarios,
effective persona modeling necessitates leveraging streaming behavior data to
continually optimize user personas. However, existing methods -whether
regenerating personas or incrementally extending them with new behaviors -often
fail to achieve sustained improvements in persona quality or future behavior
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose DEEPER, a novel approach for
dynamic persona modeling that enables continual persona optimization.
Specifically, we enhance the model's direction -search capability through an
iterative reinforcement learning framework, allowing it to automatically
identify effective update directions and optimize personas using discrepancies
between user behaviors and model predictions. Extensive experiments on dynamic
persona modeling involving 4800 users across 10 domains highlight the superior
persona optimization capabilities of DEEPER, delivering an impressive 32.2%
average reduction in user behavior prediction error over four update rounds
-outperforming the best baseline by a remarkable 22.92%.

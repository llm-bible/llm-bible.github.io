This paper is devoted to the development of a localized Large Language Model (LLM) specifically for Arabic a language imbued with unique cultural characteristics inadequately addressed by current mainstream models. Significant concerns emerge when addressing cultural sensitivity and local values. To address this the paper proposes a comprehensive solution that includes further pre-training with Arabic texts Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) utilizing native Arabic instructions and GPT-4 responses in Arabic alongside Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) employing a reward model attuned to local culture and values. The goal is to cultivate culturally cognizant and value-aligned Arabic LLMs capable of accommodating the diverse application-specific needs of Arabic-speaking communities. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that the resulting model dubbed AceGPT sets the state-of-the-art standard for open Arabic LLMs across various benchmarks. Codes data and models are in https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/AceGPT.

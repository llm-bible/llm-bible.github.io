Datasets are foundational to many breakthroughs in modern artificial intelligence. Many recent achievements in the space of natural language processing (NLP) can be attributed to the finetuning of pre45;trained models on a diverse set of tasks that enables a large language model (LLM) to respond to instructions. Instruction fine45;tuning (IFT) requires specifically constructed and annotated datasets. However existing datasets are almost all in the English language. In this work our primary goal is to bridge the language gap by building a human45;curated instruction45;following dataset spanning 65 languages. We worked with fluent speakers of languages from around the world to collect natural instances of instructions and completions. Furthermore we create the most extensive multilingual collection to date comprising 513 million instances through templating and translating existing datasets across 114 languages. In total we contribute four key resources we develop and open45;source the Aya Annotation Platform the Aya Dataset the Aya Collection and the Aya Evaluation Suite. The Aya initiative also serves as a valuable case study in participatory research involving collaborators from 119 countries. We see this as a valuable framework for future research collaborations that aim to bridge gaps in resources.

With the boom of e-commerce and web applications, recommender systems have
become an important part of our daily lives, providing personalized
recommendations based on the user's preferences. Although deep neural networks
(DNNs) have made significant progress in improving recommendation systems by
simulating the interaction between users and items and incorporating their
textual information, these DNN-based approaches still have some limitations,
such as the difficulty of effectively understanding users' interests and
capturing textual information. It is not possible to generalize to different
seen/unseen recommendation scenarios and reason about their predictions. At the
same time, the emergence of large language models (LLMs), represented by
ChatGPT and GPT-4, has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing
(NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) due to their superior capabilities in
the basic tasks of language understanding and generation, and their impressive
generalization and reasoning capabilities. As a result, recent research has
sought to harness the power of LLM to improve recommendation systems. Given the
rapid development of this research direction in the field of recommendation
systems, there is an urgent need for a systematic review of existing LLM-driven
recommendation systems for researchers and practitioners in related fields to
gain insight into. More specifically, we first introduced a representative
approach to learning user and item representations using LLM as a feature
encoder. We then reviewed the latest advances in LLMs techniques for
collaborative filtering enhanced recommendation systems from the three
paradigms of pre-training, fine-tuning, and prompting. Finally, we had a
comprehensive discussion on the future direction of this emerging field.

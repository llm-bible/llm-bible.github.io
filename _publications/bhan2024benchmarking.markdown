Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various
domains, yet their economic impact has been limited by challenges in tool use
and function calling. This paper introduces ThorV2, a novel architecture that
significantly enhances LLMs' function calling abilities. We develop a
comprehensive benchmark focused on HubSpot CRM operations to evaluate ThorV2
against leading models from OpenAI and Anthropic. Our results demonstrate that
ThorV2 outperforms existing models in accuracy, reliability, latency, and cost
efficiency for both single and multi-API calling tasks. We also show that
ThorV2 is far more reliable and scales better to multistep tasks compared to
traditional models. Our work offers the tantalizing possibility of more
accurate function-calling compared to today's best-performing models using
significantly smaller LLMs. These advancements have significant implications
for the development of more capable AI assistants and the broader application
of LLMs in real-world scenarios.

This paper presents a novel approach termed Layer-of-Thoughts Prompting
(LoT), which utilizes constraint hierarchies to filter and refine candidate
responses to a given query. By integrating these constraints, our method
enables a structured retrieval process that enhances explainability and
automation. Existing methods have explored various prompting techniques but
often present overly generalized frameworks without delving into the nuances of
prompts in multi-turn interactions. Our work addresses this gap by focusing on
the hierarchical relationships among prompts. We demonstrate that the efficacy
of thought hierarchy plays a critical role in developing efficient and
interpretable retrieval algorithms. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs),
LoT significantly improves the accuracy and comprehensibility of information
retrieval tasks.

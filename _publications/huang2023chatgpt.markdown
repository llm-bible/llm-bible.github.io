The ChatGPT, a lite and conversational variant of Generative Pretrained
Transformer 4 (GPT-4) developed by OpenAI, is one of the milestone Large
Language Models (LLMs) with billions of parameters. LLMs have stirred up much
interest among researchers and practitioners in their impressive skills in
natural language processing tasks, which profoundly impact various fields. This
paper mainly discusses the future applications of LLMs in dentistry. We
introduce two primary LLM deployment methods in dentistry, including automated
dental diagnosis and cross-modal dental diagnosis, and examine their potential
applications. Especially, equipped with a cross-modal encoder, a single LLM can
manage multi-source data and conduct advanced natural language reasoning to
perform complex clinical operations. We also present cases to demonstrate the
potential of a fully automatic Multi-Modal LLM AI system for dentistry clinical
application. While LLMs offer significant potential benefits, the challenges,
such as data privacy, data quality, and model bias, need further study.
Overall, LLMs have the potential to revolutionize dental diagnosis and
treatment, which indicates a promising avenue for clinical application and
research in dentistry.

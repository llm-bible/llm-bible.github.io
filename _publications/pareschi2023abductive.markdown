This study evaluates the GPT-4 Large Language Models abductive reasoning in complex fields like medical diagnostics criminology and cosmology. Using an interactive interview format the AI assistant demonstrated reliability in generating and selecting hypotheses. It inferred plausible medical diagnoses based on patient data and provided potential causes and explanations in criminology and cosmology. The results highlight the potential of LLMs in complex problem-solving and the need for further research to maximize their practical applications.

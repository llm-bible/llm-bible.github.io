Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented
opportunities to enhance human-AI collaboration in qualitative research
methods, including interviews. While interviews are highly valued for gathering
deep, contextualized insights, interviewers often face significant cognitive
challenges, such as real-time information processing, question adaptation, and
rapport maintenance. My doctoral research introduces Interview AI-ssistant, a
system designed for real-time interviewer-AI collaboration during both the
preparation and execution phases. Through four interconnected studies, this
research investigates the design of effective human-AI collaboration in
interviewing contexts, beginning with a formative study of interviewers' needs,
followed by a prototype development study focused on AI-assisted interview
preparation, an experimental evaluation of real-time AI assistance during
interviews, and a field study deploying the system in a real-world research
setting. Beyond informing practical implementations of intelligent interview
support systems, this work contributes to the Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)
community by advancing the understanding of human-AI collaborative interfaces
in complex social tasks and establishing design guidelines for AI-enhanced
qualitative research tools.

Educational Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to tailor
learning experiences to individual learners' needs, enhancing learning
efficiency and engagement. Despite its potential, traditional PLPP systems
often lack adaptability, interactivity, and transparency. This paper proposes a
novel approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering
to address these challenges. By designing prompts that incorporate
learner-specific information, our method guides LLMs like LLama-2-70B and GPT-4
to generate personalized, coherent, and pedagogically sound learning paths. We
conducted experiments comparing our method with a baseline approach across
various metrics, including accuracy, user satisfaction, and the quality of
learning paths. The results show significant improvements in all areas,
particularly with GPT-4, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering
in enhancing PLPP. Additional long-term impact analysis further validates our
method's potential to improve learner performance and retention. This research
highlights the promise of LLMs and prompt engineering in advancing personalized
education.

Mental health concerns are prevalent among college students, highlighting the
need for effective interventions that promote self-awareness and holistic
well-being. MindScape pioneers a novel approach to AI-powered journaling by
integrating passively collected behavioral patterns such as conversational
engagement, sleep, and location with Large Language Models (LLMs). This
integration creates a highly personalized and context-aware journaling
experience, enhancing self-awareness and well-being by embedding behavioral
intelligence into AI. We present an 8-week exploratory study with 20 college
students, demonstrating the MindScape app's efficacy in enhancing positive
affect (7%), reducing negative affect (11%), loneliness (6%), and anxiety and
depression, with a significant week-over-week decrease in PHQ-4 scores (-0.25
coefficient), alongside improvements in mindfulness (7%) and self-reflection
(6%). The study highlights the advantages of contextual AI journaling, with
participants particularly appreciating the tailored prompts and insights
provided by the MindScape app. Our analysis also includes a comparison of
responses to AI-driven contextual versus generic prompts, participant feedback
insights, and proposed strategies for leveraging contextual AI journaling to
improve well-being on college campuses. By showcasing the potential of
contextual AI journaling to support mental health, we provide a foundation for
further investigation into the effects of contextual AI journaling on mental
health and well-being.

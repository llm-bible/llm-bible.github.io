While current state-of-the-art NMT models such as RNN seq2seq and Transformers possess a large number of parameters they are still shallow in comparison to convolutional models used for both text and vision applications. In this work we attempt to train significantly (2-3x) deeper Transformer and Bi-RNN encoders for machine translation. We propose a simple modification to the attention mechanism that eases the optimization of deeper models and results in consistent gains of 0.7-1.1 BLEU on the benchmark WMT14 English-German and WMT15 Czech-English tasks for both architectures.

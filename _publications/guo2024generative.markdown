The recent surge in research focused on generating synthetic data from large language models (LLMs) especially for scenarios with limited data availability marks a notable shift in Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Their ability to perform comparably to real-world data positions this approach as a compelling solution to low-resource challenges. This paper delves into advanced technologies that leverage these gigantic LLMs for the generation of task-specific training data. We outline methodologies evaluation techniques and practical applications discuss the current limitations and suggest potential pathways for future research.

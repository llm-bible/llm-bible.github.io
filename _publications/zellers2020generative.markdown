We propose TuringAdvice a new challenge task and dataset for language understanding models. Given a written situation that a real person is currently facing a model must generate helpful advice in natural language. Our evaluation framework tests a fundamental aspect of human language understanding our ability to use language to resolve open-ended situations by communicating with each other. Empirical results show that todays models struggle at TuringAdvice even multibillion parameter models finetuned on 600k in-domain training examples. The best model a finetuned T5 writes advice that is at least as helpful as human-written advice in only 1437; of cases; a much larger non-finetunable GPT3 model does even worse at 437;. This low performance reveals language understanding errors that are hard to spot outside of a generative setting showing much room for progress.

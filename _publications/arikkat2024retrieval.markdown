In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, intelligent chatbots are
gaining prominence. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural
Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver
threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to
both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack
flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large
Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across
multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work,
we develop IntellBot, an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of
cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This
chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive
knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and
emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for
cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information
and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response,
and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge
of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our
copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8
by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which
affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to
evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores
above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.

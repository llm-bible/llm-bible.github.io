This paper presents two self45;contained tutorials on stance detection in Twitter data using BERT fine45;tuning and prompting large language models (LLMs). The first tutorial explains BERT architecture and tokenization guiding users through training tuning and evaluating standard and domain45;specific BERT models with HuggingFace transformers. The second focuses on constructing prompts and few45;shot examples to elicit stances from ChatGPT and open45;source FLAN45;T5 without fine45;tuning. Various prompting strategies are implemented and evaluated using confusion matrices and macro F1 scores. The tutorials provide code visualizations and insights revealing the strengths of few45;shot ChatGPT and FLAN45;T5 which outperform fine45;tuned BERTs. By covering both model fine45;tuning and prompting45;based techniques in an accessible hands45;on manner these tutorials enable learners to gain applied experience with cutting45;edge methods for stance detection.

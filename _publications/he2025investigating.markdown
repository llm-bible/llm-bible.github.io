Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making, yet
their susceptibility to cognitive biases remains a pressing challenge. This
study explores how personality traits influence these biases and evaluates the
effectiveness of mitigation strategies across various model architectures. Our
findings identify six prevalent cognitive biases, while the sunk cost and group
attribution biases exhibit minimal impact. Personality traits play a crucial
role in either amplifying or reducing biases, significantly affecting how LLMs
respond to debiasing techniques. Notably, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness
may generally enhance the efficacy of bias mitigation strategies, suggesting
that LLMs exhibiting these traits are more receptive to corrective measures.
These findings address the importance of personality-driven bias dynamics and
highlight the need for targeted mitigation approaches to improve fairness and
reliability in AI-assisted decision-making.

This study investigates how LLMs specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can develop tailored questions for Grade 9 math aligning with active learning principles. By utilizing an iterative method these models adjust questions based on difficulty and content responding to feedback from a simulated student model. A novel aspect of the research involved using GPT-4 as a teacher to create complex questions with GPT-3.5 as the student responding to these challenges. This setup mirrors active learning promoting deeper engagement. The findings demonstrate GPT-4s superior ability to generate precise challenging questions and notable improvements in GPT-3.5s ability to handle more complex problems after receiving instruction from GPT-4. These results underscore the potential of LLMs to mimic and enhance active learning scenarios offering a promising path for AI in customized education. This research contributes to understanding how AI can support personalized learning experiences highlighting the need for further exploration in various educational contexts

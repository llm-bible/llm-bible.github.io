Natural language explanations promise to offer intuitively understandable explanations of a neural networks decision process in complex vision45;language tasks as pursued in recent VL45;NLE models. While current models offer impressive performance on task accuracy and explanation plausibility they suffer from a range of issues Some models feature a modular design where the explanation generation module is poorly integrated with a separate module for task45;answer prediction employ backbone models trained on limited sets of tasks or incorporate ad hoc solutions to increase performance on single datasets. We propose to evade these limitations by applying recent advances in large45;scale multi45;task pretraining of generative Transformer models to the problem of VL45;NLE tasks. Our approach outperforms recent models by a large margin with human annotators preferring the generated explanations over the ground truth in two out of three evaluated datasets. As a novel challenge in VL45;NLE research we propose the problem of multi45;task VL45;NLE and show that jointly training on multiple tasks can increase the explanation quality. We discuss the ethical implications of high45;quality NLE generation and other issues in recent VL45;NLE research.

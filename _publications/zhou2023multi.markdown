Dialogue summarization involves a wide range of scenarios and domains.
However, existing methods generally only apply to specific scenarios or
domains. In this study, we propose a new pre-trained model specifically
designed for multi-scenario multi-domain dialogue summarization. It adopts a
multi-stage pre-training strategy to reduce the gap between the pre-training
objective and fine-tuning objective. Specifically, we first conduct
domain-aware pre-training using large-scale multi-scenario multi-domain
dialogue data to enhance the adaptability of our pre-trained model. Then, we
conduct task-oriented pre-training using large-scale multi-scenario
multi-domain "dialogue-summary" parallel data annotated by ChatGPT to enhance
the dialogue summarization ability of our pre-trained model. Experimental
results on three dialogue summarization datasets from different scenarios and
domains indicate that our pre-trained model significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art models in full fine-tuning, zero-shot, and few-shot settings.

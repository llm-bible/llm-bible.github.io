Large language models (LLMs) represent a transformative class of AI tools
capable of revolutionizing various aspects of healthcare by generating
human-like responses across diverse contexts and adapting to novel tasks
following human instructions. Their potential application spans a broad range
of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical
trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an
actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize
LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists
of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt
engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of
critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the
core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and
data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the
strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs
to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory
compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and
bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology,
this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary
to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these
powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in learning
environments to support teaching-be it as learning companions or as tutors.
With our contribution, we aim to discuss the implications of the
anthropomorphization of LLMs in learning environments on educational theory to
build a foundation for more effective learning outcomes and understand their
emotional impact on learners. According to the media equation, people tend to
respond to media in the same way as they would respond to another person. A
study conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology showed that chatbots can
be successfully implemented in learning environments. In this study, learners
in selected online courses were unable to distinguish the chatbot from a "real"
teacher. As LLM-based chatbots such as OpenAI's GPT series are increasingly
used in educational tools, it is important to understand how the attribution
processes to LLM-based chatbots in terms of anthropomorphization affect
learners' emotions.

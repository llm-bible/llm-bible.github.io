This paper presents our submission to the SemEval 2024 Task 5 The Legal Argument Reasoning Task in Civil Procedure. We present two approaches to solving the task of legal answer validation given an introduction to the case a question and an answer candidate. Firstly we fine-tuned pre-trained BERT-based models and found that models trained on domain knowledge perform better. Secondly we performed few-shot prompting on GPT models and found that reformulating the answer validation task to be a multiple-choice QA task remarkably improves the performance of the model. Our best submission is a BERT-based model that achieved the 7th place out of 20.

Counter45;argument generation 45;45; a captivating area in computational linguistics 45;45; seeks to craft statements that offer opposing views. While most research has ventured into paragraph45;level generation sentence45;level counter45;argument generation beckons with its unique constraints and brevity45;focused challenges. Furthermore the diverse nature of counter45;arguments poses challenges for evaluating model performance solely based on n45;gram45;based metrics. In this paper we present the ArgTersely benchmark for sentence45;level counter45;argument generation drawing from a manually annotated dataset from the ChangeMyView debate forum. We also propose Arg45;LlaMA for generating high45;quality counter45;argument. For better evaluation we trained a BERT45;based evaluator Arg45;Judge with human preference data. We conducted comparative experiments involving various baselines such as LlaMA Alpaca GPT45;3 and others. The results show the competitiveness of our proposed framework and evaluator in counter45;argument generation tasks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/amazingljy1206/ArgTersely.

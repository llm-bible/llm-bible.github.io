Building effective machine learning (ML) workflows to address complex tasks
is a primary focus of the Automatic ML (AutoML) community and a critical step
toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Recently, the
integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into ML workflows has shown great
potential for automating and enhancing various stages of the ML pipeline. This
survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of recent advancements in
using LLMs to construct and optimize ML workflows, focusing on key components
encompassing data and feature engineering, model selection and hyperparameter
optimization, and workflow evaluation. We discuss both the advantages and
limitations of LLM-driven approaches, emphasizing their capacity to streamline
and enhance ML workflow modeling process through language understanding,
reasoning, interaction, and generation. Finally, we highlight open challenges
and propose future research directions to advance the effective application of
LLMs in ML workflows.

The rapid growth of the financial sector and the rising focus on
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations highlight the need
for advanced NLP tools. However, open-source LLMs proficient in both finance
and ESG domains remain scarce. To address this gap, we introduce SusGen-30K, a
category-balanced dataset comprising seven financial NLP tasks and ESG report
generation, and propose TCFD-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating sustainability
report generation. Leveraging this dataset, we developed SusGen-GPT, a suite of
models achieving state-of-the-art performance across six adapted and two
off-the-shelf tasks, trailing GPT-4 by only 2% despite using 7-8B parameters
compared to GPT-4's 1,700B. Based on this, we propose the SusGen system,
integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), to assist in
sustainability report generation. This work demonstrates the efficiency of our
approach, advancing research in finance and ESG.

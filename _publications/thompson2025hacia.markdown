Early Detection of Risks (EDR) on the Web involves identifying at-risk users
as early as possible. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven to
solve various linguistic tasks efficiently, assessing their reasoning ability
in specific domains is crucial. In this work, we propose a method for solving
depression-related EDR using LLMs on Spanish texts, with responses that can be
interpreted by humans. We define a reasoning criterion to analyze users through
a specialist, apply in-context learning to the Gemini model, and evaluate its
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. The results show that
accurate predictions can be obtained, supported by explanatory reasoning,
providing a deeper understanding of the solution. Our approach offers new
perspectives for addressing EDR problems by leveraging the power of LLMs.

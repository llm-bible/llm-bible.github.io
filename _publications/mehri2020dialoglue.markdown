A long-standing goal of task-oriented dialogue research is the ability to flexibly adapt dialogue models to new domains. To progress research in this direction we introduce DialoGLUE (Dialogue Language Understanding Evaluation) a public benchmark consisting of 7 task-oriented dialogue datasets covering 4 distinct natural language understanding tasks designed to encourage dialogue research in representation-based transfer domain adaptation and sample-efficient task learning. We release several strong baseline models demonstrating performance improvements over a vanilla BERT architecture and state-of-the-art results on 5 out of 7 tasks by pre-training on a large open-domain dialogue corpus and task-adaptive self-supervised training. Through the DialoGLUE benchmark the baseline methods and our evaluation scripts we hope to facilitate progress towards the goal of developing more general task-oriented dialogue models.

Which large language model (LLM) is better? Every evaluation tells a story,
but what do users really think about current LLMs? This paper presents CLUE, an
LLM-powered interviewer that conducts in-the-moment user experience interviews,
right after users interacted with LLMs, and automatically gathers insights
about user opinions from massive interview logs. We conduct a study with
thousands of users to understand user opinions on mainstream LLMs, recruiting
users to first chat with a target LLM and then interviewed by CLUE. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLUE captures interesting user opinions, for
example, the bipolar views on the displayed reasoning process of DeepSeek-R1
and demands for information freshness and multi-modality. Our collected
chat-and-interview logs will be released.

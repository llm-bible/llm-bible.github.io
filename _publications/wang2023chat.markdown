Large language models have shown good performances in generating code to meet human requirements. However human requirements expressed in natural languages can be vague incomplete and ambiguous leading large language models to misunderstand human requirements and make mistakes. Worse it is difficult for a human user to refine the requirement. To help human users refine their requirements and improve large language models code generation performances we propose ChatCoder a method to refine the requirements via chatting with large language models. We design a chat scheme in which the large language models will guide the human users to refine their expression of requirements to be more precise unambiguous and complete than before. Experiments show that ChatCoder has improved existing large language models performance by a large margin. Besides ChatCoder has the advantage over refine-based methods and LLMs fine-tuned via human response.

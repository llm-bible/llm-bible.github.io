Food consumption and production contribute significantly to global greenhouse
gas emissions, making them crucial entry points for mitigating climate change
and maintaining a liveable planet. Over the past two decades, food policy
initiatives have explored interventions to reshape production and consumption
patterns, focusing on reducing food waste and curbing ruminant meat
consumption. While the evidence of "what works" improves, evaluating which
policies are appropriate and effective in specific contexts remains difficult
due to external validity challenges. This paper demonstrates that a fine-tuned
large language model (LLM) can accurately predict the direction of outcomes in
approximately 80% of empirical studies measuring dietary-based impacts (e.g.
food choices, sales, waste) resulting from behavioral interventions and
policies. Approximately 75 prompts were required to achieve optimal results,
with performance showing signs of catastrophic loss beyond this point. Our
findings indicate that greater input detail enhances predictive accuracy,
although the model still faces challenges with unseen studies, underscoring the
importance of a representative training sample. As LLMs continue to improve and
diversify, they hold promise for advancing data-driven, evidence-based
policymaking.

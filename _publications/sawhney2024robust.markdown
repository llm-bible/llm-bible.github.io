Real45;world KBQA applications require models that are (1) robust 45;45; e.g. can differentiate between answerable and unanswerable questions and (2) low45;resource 45;45; do not require large training data. Towards this goal we propose the novel task of few45;shot transfer for KBQA with unanswerable questions. We present FUn45;FuSIC that extends the state45;of45;the45;art (SoTA) few45;shot transfer model for answerable45;only KBQA to handle unanswerability. It iteratively prompts an LLM to generate logical forms for the question by providing feedback using a diverse suite of syntactic semantic and execution guided checks and adapts self45;consistency to assess confidence of the LLM to decide answerability. Experiments over newly constructed datasets show that FUn45;FuSIC outperforms suitable adaptations of the SoTA model for KBQA with unanswerability and the SoTA model for answerable45;only few45;shot45;transfer KBQA.

Spurious bias a tendency to use spurious correlations between non-essential input attributes and target variables for predictions has revealed a severe robustness pitfall in deep learning models trained on single modality data. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) which integrate both vision and language models have demonstrated strong capability in joint vision-language understanding. However whether spurious biases are prevalent in MLLMs remains under-explored. We mitigate this gap by analyzing the spurious biases in a multimodal setting uncovering the specific test data patterns that can manifest this problem when biases in the vision model cascade into the alignment between visual and text tokens in MLLMs. To better understand this problem we introduce MM-SpuBench a comprehensive visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs reliance on nine distinct categories of spurious correlations from five open-source image datasets. The VQA dataset is built from human-understandable concept information (attributes). Leveraging this benchmark we conduct a thorough evaluation of current state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings illuminate the persistence of the reliance on spurious correlations from these models and underscore the urge for new methodologies to mitigate spurious biases. To support the MLLM robustness research we release our VQA benchmark at https://huggingface.co/datasets/mmbench/MM-SpuBench."

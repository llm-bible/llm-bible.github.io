Although engagement in self-directed wellness exercises typically declines
over time, integrating social support such as coaching can sustain it. However,
traditional forms of support are often inaccessible due to the high costs and
complex coordination. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in providing
human-like dialogues that could emulate social support. Yet, in-depth, in situ
investigations of LLMs to support behavior change remain underexplored. We
conducted two randomized experiments to assess the impact of LLM agents on user
engagement with mindfulness exercises. First, a single-session study, involved
502 crowdworkers; second, a three-week study, included 54 participants. We
explored two types of LLM agents: one providing information and another
facilitating self-reflection. Both agents enhanced users' intentions to
practice mindfulness. However, only the information-providing LLM, featuring a
friendly persona, significantly improved engagement with the exercises. Our
findings suggest that specific LLM agents may bridge the social support gap in
digital health interventions.

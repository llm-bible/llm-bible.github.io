The training of large language models (LLMs) necessitates substantial data and computational resources and updating outdated LLMs entails significant efforts and resources. While numerous model editing techniques (METs) have emerged to efficiently update model outputs without retraining their effectiveness in multilingual LLMs where knowledge is stored in diverse languages remains an underexplored research area. This research paper introduces the cross45;lingual model editing (textbf123;XME125;) paradigm wherein a fact is edited in one language and the subsequent update propagation is observed across other languages. To investigate the XME paradigm we conducted experiments using BLOOM mBERT and XLM45;RoBERTa using the two writing scripts textit123;Latin125; (English French and Spanish) and textit123;Indic125; (Hindi Gujarati and Bengali). The results reveal notable performance limitations of state45;of45;the45;art METs under the XME setting mainly when the languages involved belong to two distinct script families. These findings highlight the need for further research and development of XME techniques to address these challenges.

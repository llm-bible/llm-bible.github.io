Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to harness user-item interaction
histories for item generation has emerged as a promising paradigm in generative
recommendation. However, the limited context window of LLMs often restricts
them to focusing on recent user interactions only, leading to the neglect of
long-term interests involved in the longer histories. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel Automatic Memory-Retrieval framework (AutoMR),
which is capable of storing long-term interests in the memory and extracting
relevant information from it for next-item generation within LLMs. Extensive
experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our proposed AutoMR framework in utilizing long-term interests for
generative recommendation.

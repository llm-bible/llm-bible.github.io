Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant advances in text
generation but often lack the reliability needed for autonomous deployment in
high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. Existing approaches rely
on external knowledge or human oversight, limiting scalability. We introduce a
novel framework that repurposes ensemble methods for content validation through
model consensus. In tests across 78 complex cases requiring factual accuracy
and causal consistency, our framework improved precision from 73.1% to 93.9%
with two models (95% CI: 83.5%-97.9%) and to 95.6% with three models (95% CI:
85.2%-98.8%). Statistical analysis indicates strong inter-model agreement
(\\(\kappa\\) > 0.76) while preserving sufficient independence to catch errors
through disagreement. We outline a clear pathway to further enhance precision
with additional validators and refinements. Although the current approach is
constrained by multiple-choice format requirements and processing latency, it
offers immediate value for enabling reliable autonomous AI systems in critical
applications.

Large pre45;trained language models have exhibited unprecedented capabilities in producing high45;quality text via prompting techniques. This fact introduces new possibilities for data collection and annotation particularly in situations where such data is scarce complex to gather expensive or even sensitive. In this paper we explore the potential of these models to generate and annotate goal45;oriented dialogues and conduct an in45;depth analysis to evaluate their quality. Our experiments employ ChatGPT and encompass three categories of goal45;oriented dialogues (task45;oriented collaborative and explanatory) two generation modes (interactive and one45;shot) and two languages (English and Italian). Based on extensive human45;based evaluations we demonstrate that the quality of generated dialogues and annotations is on par with those generated by humans.

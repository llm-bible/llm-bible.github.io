Selectively processing noisy utterances while effectively disregarding
speech-specific elements poses no considerable challenge for humans, as they
exhibit remarkable cognitive abilities to separate semantically significant
content from speech-specific noise (i.e. filled pauses, disfluencies, and
restarts). These abilities may be driven by mechanisms based on acquired
grammatical rules that compose abstract syntactic-semantic structures within
utterances. Segments without syntactic and semantic significance are
consistently disregarded in these structures. The structures, in tandem with
lexis, likely underpin language comprehension and thus facilitate effective
communication. In our study, grounded in linguistically motivated experiments,
we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can effectively perform
analogical speech comprehension tasks. In particular, we examine the ability of
LLMs to extract well-structured utterances from transcriptions of noisy
dialogues. We conduct two evaluation experiments in the Polish language
scenario, using a~dataset presumably unfamiliar to LLMs to mitigate the risk of
data contamination. Our results show that not all extracted utterances are
correctly structured, indicating that either LLMs do not fully acquire
syntactic-semantic rules or they acquire them but cannot apply them
effectively. We conclude that the ability of LLMs to comprehend noisy
utterances is still relatively superficial compared to human proficiency in
processing them.

Advances in GPT-based large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing natural language processing exponentially increasing its use across various domains. Incorporating uni-directional attention these autoregressive LLMs can generate long and coherent paragraphs. However for visual question answering (VQA) tasks that require both vision and language processing models with bi-directional attention or models employing fusion techniques are often employed to capture the context of multiple modalities all at once. As GPT does not natively process vision tokens to exploit the advancements in GPT models for VQA in robotic surgery we design an end-to-end trainable Language-Vision GPT (LV-GPT) model that expands the GPT2 model to include vision input (image). The proposed LV-GPT incorporates a feature extractor (vision tokenizer) and vision token embedding (token type and pose). Given the limitations of unidirectional attention in GPT models and their ability to generate coherent long paragraphs we carefully sequence the word tokens before vision tokens mimicking the human thought process of understanding the question to infer an answer from an image. Quantitatively we prove that the LV-GPT model outperforms other state-of-the-art VQA models on two publically available surgical-VQA datasets (based on endoscopic vision challenge robotic scene segmentation 2018 and CholecTriplet2021) and on our newly annotated dataset (based on the holistic surgical scene dataset). We further annotate all three datasets to include question-type annotations to allow sub-type analysis. Furthermore we extensively study and present the effects of token sequencing token type and pose embedding for vision tokens in the LV-GPT model.

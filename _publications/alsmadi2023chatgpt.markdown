The wide adoption and usage of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
models, particularly ChatGPT, has sparked a surge in research exploring their
potential applications in the educational landscape. This survey examines
academic literature published between November, 2022, and July, 2023,
specifically targeting high-impact research from Scopus-indexed Q1 and Q2
journals. This survey delves into the practical applications and implications
of generative AI models across a diverse range of educational contexts. Through
a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of recent academic literature, this
survey seeks to illuminate the evolving role of generative AI models,
particularly ChatGPT, in education. By shedding light on the potential
benefits, challenges, and emerging trends in this dynamic field, the survey
endeavors to contribute to the understanding of the nexus between artificial
intelligence and education. The findings of this review will empower educators,
researchers, and policymakers to make informed decisions about the integration
of AI technologies into learning environments.

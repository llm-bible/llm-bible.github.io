Usability testing is a fundamental research method that user experience (UX)
researchers use to evaluate and iterate a web design, but\textbf\{ how to
evaluate and iterate the usability testing study design \} itself? Recent
advances in Large Language Model-simulated Agent (\textbf\{LLM Agent\}) research
inspired us to design \textbf\{UXAgent\} to support UX researchers in evaluating
and reiterating their usability testing study design before they conduct the
real human-subject study. Our system features a Persona Generator module, an
LLM Agent module, and a Universal Browser Connector module to automatically
generate thousands of simulated users to interactively test the target website.
The system also provides an Agent Interview Interface and a Video Replay
Interface so that the UX researchers can easily review and analyze the
generated qualitative and quantitative log data. Through a heuristic
evaluation, five UX researcher participants praised the innovation of our
system but also expressed concerns about the future of LLM Agent usage in UX
studies.

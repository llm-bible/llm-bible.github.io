We show that Claude 3 Opus a large language model (LLM) released by Anthropic in March 2024 exhibits stronger machine translation competence than other LLMs. Though we find evidence of data contamination with Claude on FLORES-200 we curate new benchmarks that corroborate the effectiveness of Claude for low-resource machine translation into English. We find that Claude has remarkable textitresource efficiency -- the degree to which the quality of the translation model depends on a language pairs resource level. Finally we show that advancements in LLM translation can be compressed into traditional neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using Claude to generate synthetic data we demonstrate that knowledge distillation advances the state-of-the-art in Yoruba-English translation meeting or surpassing strong baselines like NLLB-54B and Google Translate.

This paper introduces BiMediX2, a bilingual (Arabic-English) Bio-Medical
EXpert Large Multimodal Model (LMM) with a unified architecture that integrates
text and visual modalities, enabling advanced image understanding and medical
applications. BiMediX2 leverages the Llama3.1 architecture and integrates text
and visual capabilities to facilitate seamless interactions in both English and
Arabic, supporting text-based inputs and multi-turn conversations involving
medical images. The model is trained on an extensive bilingual healthcare
dataset consisting of 1.6M samples of diverse medical interactions for both
text and image modalities, mixed in Arabic and English. We also propose the
first bilingual GPT-4o based medical LMM benchmark named BiMed-MBench. BiMediX2
is benchmarked on both text-based and image-based tasks, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across several medical benchmarks. It outperforms
recent state-of-the-art models in medical LLM evaluation benchmarks. Our model
also sets a new benchmark in multimodal medical evaluations with over 9%
improvement in English and over 20% in Arabic evaluations. Additionally, it
surpasses GPT-4 by around 9% in UPHILL factual accuracy evaluations and excels
in various medical Visual Question Answering, Report Generation, and Report
Summarization tasks. The project page including source code and the trained
model, is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/BiMediX2.

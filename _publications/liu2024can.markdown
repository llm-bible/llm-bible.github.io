Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success recently,
displaying exceptional capabilities in creating understandable and organized
text. These LLMs have been utilized in diverse fields, such as clinical
research, where domain-specific models like Med-Palm have achieved human-level
performance. Recently, researchers have employed advanced prompt engineering to
enhance the general reasoning ability of LLMs. Despite the remarkable success
of zero-shot Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT) in solving general reasoning tasks, the
potential of these methods still remains paid limited attention in the
financial reasoning task.To address this issue, we explore multiple prompt
strategies and incorporated semantic news information to improve LLMs'
performance on financial reasoning tasks.To the best of our knowledge, we are
the first to explore this important issue by applying ChatGPT to the gold
investment.In this work, our aim is to investigate the financial reasoning
capabilities of LLMs and their capacity to generate logical and persuasive
investment opinions. We will use ChatGPT, one of the most powerful LLMs
recently, and prompt engineering to achieve this goal. Our research will focus
on understanding the ability of LLMs in sophisticated analysis and reasoning
within the context of investment decision-making. Our study finds that ChatGPT
with CoT prompt can provide more explainable predictions and overcome
behavioral biases, which is crucial in finance-related tasks and can achieve
higher investment returns.

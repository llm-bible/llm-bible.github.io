ChatGPT has recently emerged as a powerful tool for performing diverse NLP tasks. However ChatGPT has been criticized for generating nonfactual responses raising concerns about its usability for sensitive tasks like fact verification. This study investigates three key research questions (1) Can ChatGPT be used for fact verification tasks (2) What are different prompts performance using ChatGPT for fact verification tasks (3) For the best-performing prompt what common mistakes does ChatGPT make Specifically this study focuses on conducting a comprehensive and systematic analysis by designing and comparing the performance of three different prompts for fact verification tasks on the benchmark FEVER dataset using ChatGPT.

Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT4, are making new waves
in the field of natural language processing and artificial intelligence, due to
their emergent ability and generalizability. However, LLMs are black-box
models, which often fall short of capturing and accessing factual knowledge. In
contrast, Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Wikipedia and Huapu for example, are
structured knowledge models that explicitly store rich factual knowledge. KGs
can enhance LLMs by providing external knowledge for inference and
interpretability. Meanwhile, KGs are difficult to construct and evolving by
nature, which challenges the existing methods in KGs to generate new facts and
represent unseen knowledge. Therefore, it is complementary to unify LLMs and
KGs together and simultaneously leverage their advantages. In this article, we
present a forward-looking roadmap for the unification of LLMs and KGs. Our
roadmap consists of three general frameworks, namely, 1) KG-enhanced LLMs,
which incorporate KGs during the pre-training and inference phases of LLMs, or
for the purpose of enhancing understanding of the knowledge learned by LLMs; 2)
LLM-augmented KGs, that leverage LLMs for different KG tasks such as embedding,
completion, construction, graph-to-text generation, and question answering; and
3) Synergized LLMs + KGs, in which LLMs and KGs play equal roles and work in a
mutually beneficial way to enhance both LLMs and KGs for bidirectional
reasoning driven by both data and knowledge. We review and summarize existing
efforts within these three frameworks in our roadmap and pinpoint their future
research directions.

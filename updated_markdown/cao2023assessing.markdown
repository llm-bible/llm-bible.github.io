The recent release of ChatGPT has garnered widespread recognition for its
exceptional ability to generate human-like responses in dialogue. Given its
usage by users from various nations and its training on a vast multilingual
corpus that incorporates diverse cultural and societal norms, it is crucial to
evaluate its effectiveness in cultural adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the underlying cultural background of ChatGPT by analyzing its
responses to questions designed to quantify human cultural differences. Our
findings suggest that, when prompted with American context, ChatGPT exhibits a
strong alignment with American culture, but it adapts less effectively to other
cultural contexts. Furthermore, by using different prompts to probe the model,
we show that English prompts reduce the variance in model responses, flattening
out cultural differences and biasing them towards American culture. This study
provides valuable insights into the cultural implications of ChatGPT and
highlights the necessity of greater diversity and cultural awareness in
language technologies.

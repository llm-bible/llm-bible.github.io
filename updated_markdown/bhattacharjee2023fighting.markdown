Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly being used for
various use cases, including text content generation at scale. Although
detection methods for such AI-generated text exist already, we investigate
ChatGPT's performance as a detector on such AI-generated text, inspired by
works that use ChatGPT as a data labeler or annotator. We evaluate the
zero-shot performance of ChatGPT in the task of human-written vs. AI-generated
text detection, and perform experiments on publicly available datasets. We
empirically investigate if ChatGPT is symmetrically effective in detecting
AI-generated or human-written text. Our findings provide insight on how ChatGPT
and similar LLMs may be leveraged in automated detection pipelines by simply
focusing on solving a specific aspect of the problem and deriving the rest from
that solution. All code and data is available at

In this multicultural age, language translation is one of the most performed
tasks, and it is becoming increasingly AI-moderated and automated. As a novel
AI system, ChatGPT claims to be proficient in such translation tasks and in
this paper, we put that claim to the test. Specifically, we examine ChatGPT's
accuracy in translating between English and languages that exclusively use
gender-neutral pronouns. We center this study around Bengali, the 7\\(^\{th\}\\) most
spoken language globally, but also generalize our findings across five other
languages: Farsi, Malay, Tagalog, Thai, and Turkish. We find that ChatGPT
perpetuates gender defaults and stereotypes assigned to certain occupations
(e.g. man = doctor, woman = nurse) or actions (e.g. woman = cook, man = go to
work), as it converts gender-neutral pronouns in languages to `he' or `she'. We
also observe ChatGPT completely failing to translate the English gender-neutral
pronoun `they' into equivalent gender-neutral pronouns in other languages, as
it produces translations that are incoherent and incorrect. While it does
respect and provide appropriately gender-marked versions of Bengali words when
prompted with gender information in English, ChatGPT appears to confer a higher
respect to men than to women in the same occupation. We conclude that ChatGPT
exhibits the same gender biases which have been demonstrated for tools like
Google Translate or MS Translator, as we provide recommendations for a human
centered approach for future designers of AIs that perform language translation
to better accommodate such low-resource languages.
